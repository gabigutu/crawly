			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike Acer and Asus, Huawei didn't exactly opt for quantity at IFA 2015. Instead the Chinese OEM stayed true to its recent marketing philosophy and relied solely on quality and the results are impressive to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cornerstone of the presentation was the new Huawei Mate S, which is nothing short of spectacular. Huawei set out to cater to the high-end premium market and has certainly had a lot of success since. But if you thought the P8 was a luxury offer, wait until you see the Mate S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Metal all around and with a spacious 5.5-inch 2.5D display, the Mate S looks and feels like one solid piece all around. The body simply molds naturally into the screen, creating a device that just feels right. Furthermore, its precise diamond-cut edges and slick finish make for a truly premium exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Mare S is more than just a showpiece, far from it. Huawei has managed to take the very well-equipped Mate 7 and extend that hardware basis even further. The amount of advanced features crammed inside the metal chassis is almost uncanny. And everything is complemented even further by Huawei's latest EMUI OS ? smarter and more gesture-friendly than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch was also extensively featured at the venue. The eagerly-anticipated wearable is now finally going out to consumer markets after a long and agonizing wait since its announcement back in March. From the looks of things, it might turn out to be the most advanced Android smartwatch currently on the market, so naturally we didn't skip to examine it thoroughly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, there is the Huawei G8 an interesting mid-range offer, which still delivers a nice exterior and a fingerprint reader, just like the Mate S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the chance to play around with Huawei's new exquisite creations at the IFA show floor and have a lot of impressions to share. So follow along to the next page for the inside scoop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Mate S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's take it from the top shall we? The exterior ? if we haven't already made this abundantly clear the Huawei Mate S is a gorgeous device, no doubt about it. Metal phones are arguably as classy as it gets and the Mate S is definitely one of the prettiest we have seen to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has spared nothing in terms of material quality and has really gone the extra length to ensure that the body is as uniform as possible. The chassis is actually molded out of a single piece of material with almost nothing else in sight, except very small plastic inserts for the antennas. The desire for smoothness extends even further with a special nanometer technology used to seamlessly attach the screen to the rest of the body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate S is also quite ergonomic and pleasant to handle. Just like its predecessor, the Mate 7, the S curves slightly at the back, which immensely improves handling, compared to a classic flat, slab design. Going round the device, there is really nothing out of place and if you have handled the Mate 7, you will feel right at home. The front of the device has the usual Huawei logo at the bottom and on top there are the standard sensors and front-facing camera (8MP with BSI and an aperture of f/2.4) complete with a LED flash for selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there is the screen, which in the case of the Mate S is a 5.5-inch AMOLED model. Actually, it seems to be a little left out in the overall beefed-up specs sheet of the phone. It still has a resolution of 1080p, which is not a bad thing in itself, but could be viewed as a shortcoming in a specs comparison with other current flagships. Furthermore, the 2.5D effect I definitely nice and so is the on-cell technology, but the Mate S does seem to have disappointingly large bezels on the inside of the screen. But it is far from a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the flip side, the screen does have Force Touch, just like the latest iPhones are supposed to have. We are not even quite sure how legal using this particular name is, but it does do it justice as it is just what you expect ? the phone reacts differently when you press harder on the screen. You can use it to zoom your photos ? nifty!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is mostly empty, housing only a SIM card slot with the rest of the important controls on the opposite side ? namely power and volume rockers. It is worth noting that the Mate S has a nice and thin profile, measuring 7.2mm, but towards the said edges it is almost razor-sharp at only 2.65mm. The charging port is at the bottom and the 3.5mm jack is on the top, nothing too special in this arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it is interesting that Huawei has fitted the Mate with a total of three microphones, which together with a custom beam-forming algorithm promise calls and recording with minimal background noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the phone we find the 13MP camera along with a dual LED flash right beside it. It looks quite impressive on paper with a back-side illuminated RGBW sensor and an aperture of f/2.0. It also comes with optical stabilization and shots seem to come out really sharp, but we will get back to that once we have the unit for testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really can't fail to mention the new fingerprint sensor. Just like on the Mate 7, it is conveniently placed on the back of the phone, where your index finger seems to naturally rest. It looks almost identical as well. However, Huawei has improved it as well. The Fingerprint 2.0 uses an upgraded security chip for on-key unlock technology, with 100% improvement in recognition speed and self-learning for better accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the hardware has picked up a few other tricks as well. The little rectangular window can also be used to control the notification bar, double-click to dismiss unread notifications, slide to preview pictures, and hold to make a phone call. Quite convenient actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we are on the topic of hardware, the rest of the Mate's specs sheet looks quite impressive as well, albeit slightly disconcerting primarily because of the custom Hisilicon Kirin 935. This particular breed of in-house chips has proven to be quite a mix bag and we have seen a lot of Huawei devices perform poorly in the past. The Kirin 935 in question looks to be the same one powering the Honor 7 and judging by its mediocre performance in our review, we can't really be too excited about Huawei's choice of power engine. There?s the usual connectivity package, including Wi-Fi and GPS, but also NFC and an FM receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the rest of the specs, now would be a great time to note that the Mate S actually comes in two variants. One is the regular version and the other is dubbed "Premium". Both have 3GB of RAM, but the Premium has 64GB of storage, instead of 32GB. It also comes with different color options (Prestige gold and Coral pink, instead of the standard Titanium grey and Mystique champagne) and naturally a bigger price tag. The regular version will set you back around ?649, white the Premium one will cost a good ?699, so we are definitely knee deep in flagship territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but definitely not least, the software deserves a few words. Huawei's own EMUI 3.1 boots on the device. It is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop and is now more feature-rich than ever. New gestures are center stage for the experience so much so that Huawei has turned the concept of "feel" and "Touch. Made Powerful" into the selling point for the model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the already mentioned Force Touch, Knuckle gestures are now more powerful than ever. You can double knuckle to capture a screenshot a knuckle "W" to instantly forward whatever you are looking at in a chat. Other uses include easy cropping and quick access to professional camera mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei G8 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei G8 was announced back in July with a memorable all-metal design, a 5.5" 1080p display and Snapdragon 615 chipset. Other key features include a 13MP rear camera with a dual-LED flash, a 5MP selfie snapper, 2GB/3GB RAM depending on the storage setting - 16GB or 32GB options, and a 3,000 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei brought the G8 today at IFA and we spent some quality time with it. The silver version we saw looked indeed gorgeous and we could pick it next to a Mate or an Honor right away because of its rounder corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Metal looks good on most of the smartphones today and the G8 is no exception. If you happen to opt for a G8 in the upcoming months you'll be definitely treating yourself with a looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peek on the back reveals a familiar picture - the protruding 13MP camera lens is protected by a piece of sapphire glass, and there is the big fingerprint reader. We love what Huawei is doing with the finger sensor on the back - you can use it for snapping selfies or pulling down the notification dropdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the two pieces of plastic around the top and bottom of the G8 - those hide the antennas. According to Huawei the G8 packs a duo of antennas to boost your signal like never before. We couldn?t test this right now though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei will be releasing the G8 this month and it is expected to cost about ?300 or so.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Huawei watch has definitely been a major tease. Ever since its unveiling at MWC, all the way back in March 2015, the wearable has mostly eluded consumer markets with an occasional cameo at events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's official, the Huawei Watch finally is launching within the US! Pre-orders are now live on Amazon, the Google Store, BestBuy and GetHuawei.com. Units should start shipping on September 17, so the long wait is finally over. Canada should get it by the end of the month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Europe is also included in the road map and the watch will be available in Germany, France, Spain and Italy later this month. The UK, Japan and UAE will follow shortly with even more markets planned down the road. So, we are definitely looking at a global roll out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In light of this announcement, we were compelled to take another stab at the Huawei Watch and see it is still just as impressive among the smartwatch crowd as it was a few months ago when we first made a hands-on review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in March, the Huawei Watch came out mere hours after the LG Watch Urbane and definitely managed to outstage it and get the hype going. Now, the long overdue launch coincidentally happens to follow the announcement of Samsung's first round wearable and surprisingly enough, Huawei's creation still seems to offer a superior package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact is that the young wearable niche is still amidst some major soul-searching. The most practical and logical course of development is rather unclear and new devices from the likes of LG, for example, seem to be rehashing old hardware with only slight aesthetic changes. This is definitely the safer route for feeling out the market preferences and desires, but it takes a little extra courage and initiative to stand out and push the envelope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei definitely seems to be going the extra mile with its wearable, so much so that it is still arguably superior in both looks and hardware to the latest generation of competitor wearables, like the Samsung Gear S2 and even the eagerly-anticipated Moto 360 (2nd gen). The Huawei Watch is undoubtedly a gorgeous device and one that excels at seamlessly blending traditional watch design with modern smart tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is made out of cold-forged stainless steel. The case measures 42mm in diameter - compact for a smartwatch and about average for a regular watch - and is 11.3mm thick. It's quite light as well, which may not be your thing if you prefer heavy watches. This might sound bulky, but it is actually overall smaller than the LG Watch Urbane and yet has a bigger and sharper screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is what we mean by pushing the envelope, the Huawei Watch might not be groundbreaking or revolutionary, but it is arguably the most premium offer in the round smartwatch realm. Its screen is a 1.4" AMOLED, perfectly round, with 400 x 400px resolution and 286 ppi. It tops the competition, although, there isn't really any striking difference in contrast or sharpness when we compare the Huawei with an LG Watch Urbane for example. Still, if you are after the best possible hardware, this seems to be it for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the premium aspects of the Huawei Watch don't stop there. Unlike most of its competitors, it comes with a scratch-resistant two-layer sapphire glass option, which is incredibly important for something you will most-likely have dangling on your wrist throughout the day. The 316L cold-forged stainless steel body construction is also something usually associated with premium watches. This does come at a price and naturally the option is only reserved for the high-end variants. If, however, you promise yourself to be extra careful, you could pick one up for as little as $349 (?399 in Europe). This price tag however can be stretched quite a lot to a maximum of $799 (?699 in Europe) for the most premium model. This is far from what an Apple Watch Edition can go for, but is still a pretty penny for a wearable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of options, Huawei definitely has you spoiled for choice. Stock customization might not be as abundant as with the Apple Watch or the Moto Maker, but six initial models are more than enough and definitely not as limiting as what LG or Samsung have to offer. Furthermore, all the pre-made combinations are aesthetically pleasing and convey a sense of elegance. No baby blue or duck-like orange in sight. Here is what you can currently choose from:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, it is worth noting that the band is a pretty standard 18mm one, which means the Huawei Watch can easily be fitted with a lot of aftermarket options as well. We have also seen a few more OEM wristbands from Huawei in the past, so customizing shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The band placement on the Huawei Watch actually contributes quite a lot to its traditional watch design. It is neatly tucked inside the body with no visible gap. The angle on the strap assembly is also pretty steep. This all adds up to a nice and comfortable wearing experience, where the watch simply sits flush on the wrist. This might sound like nitpicking, but the way the LG G Watch R strap fits, definitely makes it feel like more of a strapped-in screen than a traditional watch. This only got worse with the Watch Urbane, which has a slightly elongated body and tends to sit unnaturally on the hand. But, we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main point is that Huawei has obviously put a lot of thought and effort into constructing an elegant and ergonomic gadget that won't get in the way and it has definitely paid off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On to the rest of the hardware and software, powering the Huawei Watch. Apart from the aforementioned beefed-up display, there is nothing really special about the device's specs sheet. It follows the current wearable trend and is based on a Snapdragon 400 SoC with 512MB of RAM. It is also fitted with a 6-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, a PPG heart rate sensor on the bottom and even a barometer, so you could say it is fairly aware of its surroundings and wearer. It does have a microphone, like most other Android Wear devices, which is definitely nifty for using Google's voice input. Its 300 mAh battery can easily get you through 1.5 to 2 days of moderate use. Fast charging can top its battery up to 80% in just 45 minutes and all the way to a hundred in 75min.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the software, we already mentioned that Huawei has decided to go with a standard-friendly approach and runs the latest version of Android Wear (1.3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's wearable platform has come a long way in its relatively short lifecycle and is now better than ever with an easier menu structure, autonomous Wi-Fi operation capabilities and more-interactive watch faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, a recent development made it clear that the Wear platform is no longer limited to Android users. iPhone owners can now use the Huawei Watch, as well as most other Wear devices without the need of convoluted and unstable hacks. The experience might not be quite as feature-rich as on an Android device, but now the Apple Watch definitely has some tough competition to compete with on its home turf.</paragraph>
