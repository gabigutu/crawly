			<paragraph>Using two SIM cards in one phone is increasingly becoming an option that people are willing to consider. Using both a personal and a business number with one single handset, saving some money by combining two different plans or network carriers, or using regularly local pre-paid cards on your business trips - all those are just example reasons why one should turn attention to a dual-SIM mobile. You no longer need to carry two mobiles on you at all times since manufacturers have been coming up with ingenious ways of dealing with the situation. The dual SIM holder was the forerunner, dual SIM adapters following shortly after. These were obviously not enough of a remedy, so dual SIM phones have recently started to appear on the market. Major mobile phones manufacturers seem disinterested, or try to avoid potential pressure from the telecoms. However, small-scale manufacturers have taken the plunge in search of their own little corner on the market. There are also attempts to resolve the issue using software instead of hardware means, like redirecting calls for example. In the lines to follow, we are going to show you all the ways to get around having two handsets. Some of them, we hope, may prove useful to you.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM holder - A decent beginning<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first and simplest solution was a dual SIM holder, which allows you to connect two SIM cards to your card slot. It is by far the cheapest of options but it does not even come close to fully solving the problem. The main flaw it has is that it does not really work with both cards simultaneously. Instead one SIM is operating at a given time while the other, which is referred to as ghost-SIM, is unusable. The user is able to alternate the two by turning the phone off and then back on. Not a great improvement compared to carrying the second SIM in your wallet and changing it when necessary. It only saves you the effort to remove the back cover and battery, reducing the replacement time by a couple of seconds or minutes, depending on you phone's design and the time it needs to turn off and then back on. The other major downer is the holder size. Quite bigger than a normal SIM, it just won't fit in some handsets. All in all, this solution is only applicable if you use the alternative SIM card rarely or you use it only for those casual outgoing calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   This is what most Dual SIM holders look like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM adapter - evolution, not revolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Basically, adapters do not differ much from holders, as they function in pretty much the same way. The main difference, which is to say, the major benefit is that the dual SIM adapter is the same size as a regular SIM card and therefore can fit in any phone. On the other hand, fitting the two SIM cards in the module can be a challenge as you need to extract the actual SIM chips out of their plastic beds and then place them in the adapter. Cutting and puncturing your cards involves a certain level of risk. Fortunately, most dual SIM adapter dealers will do that for you upon purchase. Some more recent models allow switching between the SIM cards without turning the phone off. Instead, a switch SIM option appears on the phone menu. Yet, you still can't use the two SIM cards simultaneously. The other bad news for those considering SIM holders and adapters is that neither option will do much of a job on a locked phone, unless both cards used are of the same carrier.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM phones take one - small steps the right way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first reportedly dual SIM mobiles turned more of a marketing gimmick than the Holy Grail for people with too little space in their pocket. They were claimed to have two SIM card slots, and they did! But only one could be used at a time. So no great improvement here, except that alternating the cards was possible without turning the phone off. Plus, fitting both SIM cards into the phone wasn't that much of a burden any more - so much for cutting and clipping. Also, the dual SIM phones are never carrier-locked, which is a real load off. Falling just short of a breakthrough, these forerunners were a promise that a device able to operate with two SIM cards simultaneously was on the way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual phones - Real deal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Putting some thought on it, some people came with the idea of mechanically connect two mobiles in a way that will allow using both. One of the pioneers was the WND Telecom. Their Wind DUO 2000 did have decent looks on top of doing the job it was designed to. Although not exactly a top class feature-rich phone, it was adequately sized and reasonable. Another, more recent, addition to the dual phones ranks - the iCool G700 - was a clamshell with two SIM cards. In fact it's another combination of two phones, each with its own screen and keypad, only using the same battery. The Wind DUO Atom is probably also worth mentioning here. It's been announced and should be coming soon, but we'll get back to that later in the article. One thing we have to admit: though a little odd-looking, these phones are up to their task and they manage to deliver.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM phones take two - Veni, vidi, vici!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the latest release - an actual dual SIM card phone. Not just one that can store two SIMs, but one that is actually capable of operating them as easy as one-two-three. And we had our hands on one of these. Manufactured by CECT, now one of the best known Chinese mobile phone makers, this device claims to be as good as two separate handsets, packed in one. It is indeed a very compact and quite tasteful bar. Well, probably not the LG Prada or Nokia Sirocco stuff , but honestly, we've seen way worse by far better-rated makers. Stay with us while we check how good it is at handling its two SIM cards. See if it's the dream solution to your two-handsets-are-too-much-for-my-pocket problem.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Saying a few introductory words for this particular phone is not an easy task at all. Although a relatively well-known producer, the Chinese company CECT makes it a real hard job identifying its different models. We cannot even be sure about the name of the model we have in our hands, because there is no info on it. The policy of the company is to obviously put as little branding on its phones as possible, so dealers can put any label they want. At least the model has all the typical characteristics of a CECT phone - touchscreen display, a band with icons in its lower end, combined with a bit strange keypad, whereby the buttons that are typically placed on the lowest line - the asterisk, the 0 and the hash buttons - are placed on the right side of the keypad. This is not the only brand that makes such extraordinary keypads - for example Philips are known for producing similar keypad layouts for quite a while now. This layout however does take a little time getting used to. Now to the essence of our review - call handling and all that is related to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The earpiece behaves quite well when making or receiving a call and is loud enough. There were some problems with the microphone, which prevented the opposite side from hearing very well at times, but this only happened in a small portion of the calls we made. The four loudspeakers are really good and you have little chance of missing an incoming call, even in very noisy surroundings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is quite straightforward and lists all contacts from the phone along with the ones from both SIM cards. A small icon next to each contact indicates what location it is saved in. Navigating around is relatively easy especially once you get used to operating the touchscreen and the keyboard cooperatively. The phonebook can save up to 300 contacts with 12 fixed name fields for each of them - 4 of these fields can be used for phone numbers. Unfortunately there is only a single field for the name so switching between first name and last name ordering view is impossible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call Log:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The call log is divided in three different tabs: dialed, received and missed calls, and each is able to record up to 20 entries. Each entry has information about time and duration as well as a tag to show which SIM card was used. There is also an SMS counter and a call timer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, that's where the young Chinese's strength lies. With both SIM cards active, you can place and receive calls on each of them at any time. Other types of such phones have two dial buttons - one for each SIM - so you can easily choose the SIM card of choice for a particular outgoing call. In our test handset though designers have taken quite a different approach by adding a button labeled "B" which stands for SIM card B. You can also use the display where two small green receiver icons represent each card. There is only a small catch regarding receiving calls - if you're in a call on one of the SIM cards and at the same time someone is trying to reach you on the other, the second call will be canceled. If both calls occur simultaneously, they are displayed on the screen and it is up to the user to decide which one to accept. The other call however is then rejected. There's reason to believe however, that other models of the company are able to deal with this issue better - meaning that they should be able offer call waiting for the second incoming call instead of canceling it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text messaging:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sending a text message is never a problem with this phone. You can compose the message using one of the three input methods: keypad, touch QWERTY keyboard or handwriting recognition. That latter one though, we're not so happy about. The CECT doesn't seem to handle it that well. Then, you can choose the SIM card to use for sending and select the number of the addressee. Any number in the phone is available no matter which SIM card you're using to send the message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other features:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call handling is impressive enough, but the handset has a lot of other features to offer. The touch screen we already mentioned. There is also a video and audio player, both of above average quality. By the way, few other phones can match the sound volume of the CECT we tested. Sound quality is not that impressive, but decent is the least we can say. There's a microSD (labeled as T-Flash on the phone) memory card slot and a connector combining a USB port and charger plug. Moreover, the handset is charging during PC connections and file transfers. The handset we tested has most types of organizing features: a to-do list, a calendar and alarm. You also get a number of games, as well as a calculator and a unit and currency converter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that said, it's safe to conclude that if you are a person with two mobile numbers and you don't believe that all the latest technologies in the mobile realm are a must-have, this phone is completely capable of doing the right job for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Future<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few products have already been announced and about to hit the shelves in the near future. The one worth your attention is the WND Telecom's Wind DUO Atom. Equipped with a gravity sensor for seamless alternation of the SIM cards, it's got the looks to please the style-sensitive users, without compromising performance. A promise has been made and we'll hold the DUO Atom to it.</paragraph>
