			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have long ago shown that they are not afraid of any challenge, producing handsets that have claimed a top spot on the market. There are still plenty of fans from those good old days that would love to see another market-leading device thrown their way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A look at what's between the XPERIA X1 and the Satio is enough to tell you what Sony Ericsson have been up to for the past year. A top-dog Cybershot (C905) and an all-round Walkman (W995) were both compelling enough but none would be trusted to top the portfolio of a company that used to call the shots at the forefront of mobile technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Sony Ericsson might have been busy cutting costs, fueling the hype behind their new wave gadgets (Satio, Aino and Rachael) or experimenting with Symbian and Android. But there's little doubt about their full-time job. The Satio is a lot more than its mouthwatering features, full touchscreen debuting Symbian S60 or its 12 megapixel camera. It may be too much to say that all the company's hopes lie with the Satio but the burden on its shoulders is disproportionate compared to any other flagship device we can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This review, by the way, is coming after a massive spoiler. But the good thing is we know the Satio is all geared and ready to face some serious challenges. An industry leading cameraphone, or top-of-the-line smartphone, the Satio has a clear view of its goal. But you can be certain that its path forward will not be covered in rose petals. Sony Ericsson are in dire need of fresh devices (and cash) and the Satio should not be anything but a bestseller. When you're trying to turn your fortunes around, you have very little room for error.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little to complain about looking at the list above, but the difference between a moderately successful handset and a blockbuster depends on all the performance you can squeeze out of those features. And with the Symbian S60 touch reincarnation hardly the most heralded OS on the market, the job gets even more complicated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition is at an all-time high in the premium segment, Sony Ericsson won't enter the battle unarmed. The sleek Satio knows it has a trick or two up its sleeves and is eager to show the world its worth. And here we are revealing those secrets for you, starting with the design and handling on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing meets expectations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio comes in a pretty compact box, which made us worried that there wouldn't be enough stuff inside to justify the price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out, our worries were unfounded. The box has all the things the vast majority of users will ever need. Along with the handset itself, you get a wall charger, user guide and a USB cable for connecting your Satio to a computer. There's also a stylus in there but since we aren't great fans dongle-style ones we hardly ever took it out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the headphones are a rather basic set. We got a one-piece handsfree, which is a major letdown, given the absence of a 3.5mm audio jack on the Satio. We have reason to believe though the box contents are market dependent and luckier users may be treated to a two-piece headset with a 3.5 mm adapter on the remote, or even a TV-out cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We certainly cheered the 8GB microSD card we found inside the box. The Satio's syncing software comes preinstalled on the card, so all you need to do is plug the USB cable in the handset and install it right form there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are some quick-start guides in the box too, if you need tips about handling the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Satio 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 112 x 55 x 13 mm the Sony Ericsson Satio can be slipped into most pockets without causing too much of a bulge. It's not what you'd call a compact set but the 3.5" touchscreen is a pretty good excuse. The extra girth around the lens is about what you would expect in a device boasting a 12 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased however with the solid feel that the 126 grams give the handset. More importantly though, handling the phone is quite comfortable - most of the features are within thumb's reach and the active lens cover and handy camera controls are very user-friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio comes in a choice of three different colors - black, silver and bordeaux. Having had the black version for a preview we have to admit the bordeaux paintjob is hardly as inspiring. We suspect it has something to do with the shiny red plastic being a bit too feminine for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the Satio is almost entirely made of plastic, which looks pretty nice but we still prefer some metal on our mobiles. We are willing to accept this (admittedly high quality) material for the sake of keeping the handset weight down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the Satio's front is taken up by the 3.5" touchscreen with a resolution of 640 x 360 pixels. The resistive unit supports up to 16M colors and is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the device. It has remarkable picture quality with incredible brightness and excellent contrast for a TFT unit. Images look impressively vibrant on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resistive displays generally need more pressure to get a click registered. As we found out, the Satio's screen response is just fine - you don't need to push like your life depends on it. It is by no means as sensitive as capacitive displays but then again, you can use the Satio with a stylus or with your gloves on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the display is decent, but not as good as the Nokia N97, let alone the Apple iPhone. Still you will be able find a proper angle for working with the phone even in the brightest sunlight if you try hard enough so that shouldn't be a deal-breaker. Sony Ericsson still aren't up with the best in this department but they aren't too far behind either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three hardware controls underneath the display, while the video-call camera, ambient light sensor and the earpiece are on top. There is also a proximity sensor up there to take care of switching the display off when you hold it against your ear in a call. The hardware keys are a bit too thin but still usable. They have decent press and blend well with the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Satio's main controls are a Call and an End key on each side of a menu button. Pressing and holding the menu key launches the task manager - in the long-standing Symbian tradition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson Satio features the screen lock slider, the proprietary universal connectivity port and the microSD card slot. The absence of a 3.5mm standard jack and microUSB for data and charging are certainly among the small details that compromise Satio's user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the memory card slot is covered by a plastic lid so it won't fill up with dust. Plus, the Satio is yet another recent Sony Ericsson handset to move away from the Memory Stick storage. The Satio can easily handle 16GB microSD cards, so the transition is pretty seamless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The right side hosts an array of controls. The three located towards the bottom are all camera-related. There's a nicely responsive shutter key with distinct half-press for autofocus, a button to toggle camera modes and a dedicated gallery key. The volume rocker is further up and it isn't totally irrelevant to imaging either, as it doubles as a zoom lever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key of the Sony Ericsson Satio is placed at the top, right next to the loudspeaker. As on any other Symbian handset, you can also use the power key for switching profiles on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All there is at the bottom is the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson Satio reveals its other standout feature. The 12 megapixel camera lens is underneath the stylish cover , accompanied by both xenon and a LED flash. The dual flash solution makes sure the Satio is covered in low-light conditions for both stills and video recording. There are also a couple of tiny apertures around the camera lens, which we guess are some kind of light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having seen the Satio in action in our recent 12 megapixel shootout, praises for the image quality will hardly be a spoiler. The imaging performance is impressive and we'll gladly shoot a few more rounds with the Satio in the camera chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover on the Satio reveals the 1000 mAh Li-Po BST-33 battery. BST-33 batteries are nominally 900 mAh so we're wondering where did those additional 100 mAh get from, but the pure specs are not the point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the screen size, you can hardly expect miracles from it, but it still managed to last through the day even if we never gave it a break. Since we doubt it any of you will be taking a hundred photos a day and endlessly fiddling with the other phone features, you have good reason to expect a longer gap between charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to mention that Sony Ericsson have gone for a strange solution for the SIM compartment on the Satio. You place the card on a small plastic tray, which slides in under the lens cover. It's probably a neat trick to save some space but the plastic tray looks pretty fragile. If you're in the habit of frequently changing SIM cards you should be careful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summing it up, the general build quality of the Satio is quite good and the materials used are both nice looking and durable. The handset feels perfect in the hand and, despite being a bit thicker at the top, it is evenly weighted so there is no risk of it slipping out of your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample touchscreen is a treat in terms of image quality, and the response is quite pleasing. The camera controls are very user-friendly, and the active lens cover does well to both enhance the imaging experience and highlight the phone's key feature. Our main concerns with the Satio are the absence of a standard USB port and 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, there a few hardware issues, which are not make-or-break perhaps, but still a nuisance in a high-end device. Ergonomics are quite up to scratch though and the Satio handles nicely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Satio runs the Symbian OS 5th edition but you'd never tell by just looking at the homescreen. It's a clean break from how other manufacturers see the touch-operated Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starers we have prepared a short video demonstration of the user interface of the Satio. It should give you a better idea of most of the changes introduced by Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen uses a tabbed interface but not like the "Vertical icon bar" often seen (though rarely used) in Nokia handsets. There are five tabs, which are in effect five alternative homescreen panes: favorite contacts, bookmarks, home, photos, shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five shortcuts on the top of the display, one for each tab. Alternatively, horizontal finger sweeps can be used to navigate between the tabs. The transition itself is visually pleasing with its smooth animations - even if you switch from the first to the last tab, things will roll across the screen with no lag at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home tab is a typical homescreen - wallpaper, operator name, time and date (though time is also visible in the status row on top) and music controls. The music controls act as a shortcut to the music player and if there's a song playing it will display track info (with album art) and basic player controls. There are four additional shortcuts at the bottom - Dialer, Media, Messaging and Web search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home tab is placed in the center. The leftmost tab is the favorite contacts tab, which gives quick access to a selection of contacts. They are displayed in a list with contact photos if available, so nothing fancy. Tapping a contact, brings up a popup with three options - Call, Message, View in contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is the bookmarks and it does what it says. You can add new links but you can have eight at most. Another thing we would've liked is favicons in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth tab - photos - shows a vertical list of all your photos, sorted by date. It comes with kinetic scrolling and is the fastest way to view the latest photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth tab is the shortcuts tab and holds a list of eight shortcuts - be they shortcuts to applications or bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is more standard - there's a choice between a grid and list arrangement, and by default the shortcuts are arranged so that they resemble the typical Sony Ericsson menu. The icons will feel very familiar to experienced Sony Ericsson users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest however is S60 5th edition - the D-pad and soft-key based navigation translated into touchscreen. Lists still require a double tap to select and confirm, while icons take just a single tap. There's a shortcut to the task switcher or you can long-press the menu key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony needs smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Sony Ericsson Satio. Reception levels are good on both ends of a call, the earpiece is loud enough and there was no interference whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two things the phone lacks are Smart dialing and voice dialing. These two are included in other versions of Symbian and should have been available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can silence an incoming call on the phone by simply flipping it over. The proximity sensor automatically switches off the display when you put the phone to your ear and switches it back on when you pull it away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-call performance is very good. Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically while close to your head. There are four big buttons available - mute, hold, loudspeaker and end call. Form the options menu you can find more settings like lock screen and keys, switch to video call, new call, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on Satio. The handset didn't perform too well but still scored a Good mark meaning we have seen (and heard) better. You might want to keep a closer look on it when you are in noisier environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Satio uses the standard Symbian S60 5th edition phonebook. It has virtually unlimited capacity and functionality is among the best we've seen. You can set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can order contacts by first or last name and you can naturally search any contact by gradual typing. To speed things along, the search keyboard is special - letters are in alphabetical order and not the entire alphabet is available. For instance, if there are no contacts whose name starts with a C, the letter C won't appear on the custom keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign personal sound ringtones and videos to the individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging menu is yet another part of the Symbian S60 UI that hasn't been modified at all since the Nokia 5800, apart from some reskinning of the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Satio supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone. When composing an SMS, a counter is displayed of characters left up to a limit of 160. An indicator in brackets shows the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you insert some multimedia content or an email address as recipient, the counter is replaced by a data counter showing the size of your email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Satio also features a dedicated audio message recorder. Much like with Symbian S60 v3.2, you can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory. The interface of all the message editors is quite similar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can activate delivery reports - they come up on the screen as simple pop ups and are automatically saved in a separate messaging folder after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. It prompts you to choose whether you prefer POP or IMAP access to mail providers that support both. However, it failed to set up the email settings automatically for our Gmail account so we had to do it by hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can check for new mail automatically at a given interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available when you compose emails offline. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Satio. You can also subscribe to multiple folders, so you can check email in folders other than the Inbox, e.g. the Starred folder in Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing emails is a bit weird - sweeping your finger selects text and prompts you to copy it. This means you have to use the scrollbar. Easily copying text is great but we would have liked some way to toggle between scrolling and selecting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments and signatures - the Satio meets virtually all your email needs, and with a screen resolution like this, reading emails on the device is a real pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio offers a complete selection of input methods The handset has a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad in both portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It definitely cannot be a match for any hardware keyboard but the Satio full QWERTY fares pretty well. Typing is enhanced by accurate haptic feedback and the keys are large enough for typos to be reduced to a healthy minimum. Unfortunately there is no predictive typing like on the Apple iPhone or the Nokia E71, but we do not consider this much of a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, rotating the handset doesn't bring up the landscape QWERTY keyboard as a default input method and instead you have to select it manually from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a mini version of the QWERTY keyboard which is only good for stylus use, typing with fingers is possible but it's a real test of your patience. Its main advantage is that it takes little space on the screen and can be moved around so it doesn't block your view of things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Ericsson Satio offers handwriting recognition and actually does a rather decent job of it, recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve its performance by taking the handwriting training - this is where you actually show the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager is extensive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian file management system has been top notch for quite a while now, and it's difficult to imagine what needs to change. The application can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a specific file or directory is also available on the phone. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card) Satio will find it for you in no time. There's also a dedicated Search app, which searches through more than just files - it will sift through your notes, contacts, pretty much anything on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media center: Sony Ericsson jumps in where Symbian can't deliver<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio Media center is a replica of what you usually find on the company's feature phones (and Sony Playstations, mind you) - an attractive and convenient way of accessing the media content on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson decided to minimize the Media shortcuts (at least at this stage) and there are only three of the usual suspects to make up the main media center menu - Photo, Music and Video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may already guessed the first one will lead you to the main gallery with various options available, the second give access to all playlist and the Walkman and finally, the third one will show you all video clips stored on the Satio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The photo gallery is definitely among the best we've seen with great customization capabilities and features aplenty. Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, timeline view for your images and tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tags are a very helpful feature offering better ways to make albums - one photo can belong to more than one tag, which you can't do with folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos is a joy with the Satio, especially when browsing images fullscreen. When you want to go to the next in line, it doesn't simply pop up but instead slides in from left or right. The selected photo expands smoothly to fill the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can reveal the full list of available options by tapping on the screen - delete, edit, use as, assign to contact, slideshow, print tag, rotate, information, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Pictures section, which stores all the preloaded images that were not taken with the phone's camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman on Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio comes with the Walkman music player and all the accompanying extras and eye-candy. Much like the rest of the media menu, the accelerometer is used here for automatic rotation of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to listen to. The "Now playing" screen is simple but offers all the needed controls and information. The tracks are controlled by comfortably large and thumbable on-screen keys at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the Satio offered neither equalizers nor alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Sony Ericsson Satio has pretty limited functionality compared to the one found on the company's features phones. It has neither slow-mo playback nor screenshot capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our real grudge with the video player however is that there's no DivX and XviD support - what can we say, LG and Samsung handsets have definitely spoiled us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the missing support for the extremely popular codecs, either you'll have to buy a new application for video playback or you'll have to convert all your videos by using MediaGo (with all the imposed limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the watching experience itself, the Satio is nothing short of flawless. High resolution, excellent image quality and 16:9 aspect ratio make for a really nice video combo indeed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update Nov 10: As it turned out the Sony Ericsson Satio had some issues with our testing equipment, which prevented it from demonstrating its full potential. Now that we have those issues solved we are able to give you a more accurate representation of the Satio audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset performs extremely well in this department, the cut-off extreme bass frequencies being the only slight shortfall. However the frequency response is excellent for the rest of the audible range so we are willing to let that one go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of the other readings are pretty good too with the distortion levels simply great. The stereo crosstalk, the noise level and the dynamic range are also pretty good. You can see for yourselves that the Sony Ericsson Satio is quite a gifted musician from the table below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Best or second best, the Satio camera is a standard-setter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio packs one of the first 12 megapixel cameras in the mobile phone world and we did a head-to-head shootout with the other 12MP camera phone - the Samsung Pixon12. With maximum image resolution of 4000 x 3000 pixels, both xenon and LED flash, it makes basic point-and-shoot cameras look obsolete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Satio camera interface is reasonably comfortable with the viewfinder occupying only the central part of the screen when regular 4:3 aspect ratio is selected. When shooting in 16:9 aspect ratio (9MP), however, the whole display is put to use from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the viewfinder there are five shortcuts. Those include Scenes, Shoot mode, Flash settings, Exposure compensation and Auto mode. When you select Auto mode the handset takes care to select the most appropriate scene mode for each of your photos and apply the proper settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu gives you quite a load of customizable options. Those include focus mode, white balance, effects, image stabilizer and self-timer. You can also choose whether you'll see a preview of every taken snapshot and if the image orientation should be recorded in the EXIF info. The camcorder part of the camera supports a very similar set of customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A high-end cameraphone, the Sony Ericsson Satio naturally comes with image geo-tagging too. There is also face and smile-detection onboard, as well as panorama mode and Touch capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name suggests, Touch capture allows you to focus on any particular subject in the frame by simply tapping on it in the viewfinder. The Satio will automatically focus on it and take a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mechanical lens cover offers the best possible protection for the lens. Also, it's an active one - that means that sliding it open launches the camera even if the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other mechanical shortcuts that work with the camera besides the shutter key are the volume rocker for digital zoom control, a gallery shortcut and a button that toggles between still image capture and video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are interested in finding out everything there is to know about the image quality of the Sony Ericsson Satio please check out our 12 megapixel shootout article. There you'll find a pretty detailed analysis of the two best cameras on a mobile phone currently on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To summarize though, the Sony Ericsson Satio produces splendid images that are well beyond the output of any of its 8 megapixel rivals. The colors are vibrant and saturated, the amount of resolved detail is great and the noise levels are tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Pixon12 did have a small edge in image quality and xenon flash performance,the Satio has its own strengths as well. Simply said, the Sony Ericsson smartphone is some optical zoom away from matching low-end and mid-range digicam performance but we guess you can't have it all just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are some samples from the Sony Ericsson Satio camera, some of which you won't find in the shootout.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio will produce VGA videos at 30 fps, equaling the XPERIA X1 achievement. Some of the issues we had with the prerelease Satio unit were ironed out and now everything is up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the videos is really good with an almost unmatched amount of resolved detail, very good contrast and precise colors. While the HD capabilities of the Samsung Omnia HD are out of reach, the Satio is definitely among the top contenders for the world title in the VGA category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Sony Ericsson Satio  camera video sample for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is full suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Satio is well versed in connectivity - all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics, there's quad-band GSM and EDGE support, as well as 3G network compatibility. The Satio has dual-band 900/2100 MHz support for worldwide coverage, as well as an American version at 850/1900/2100 MHz. Data speeds are quite high with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 3.6Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity offers the obligatory Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. Satio also comes with Wi-Fi, which includes DLNA support. Oh, and there's the wired connectivity, which unfortunately makes use of only the proprietary Fast Port connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This Sony Ericsson has gone with with microSD cards recently, not Memory Sticks. The card slot on the Satio is is hot-swappable and easily accessible - it's hidden under a flap on the left side of the phone. It supports cards with a capacity of up to 16GB (it comes with an 8GB card in the box), which is more free space than we've ever needed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser has Flash but disappoints in usability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Satio uses the S60 5th edition browser and starts up with the typical Sony Ericsson homepage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has quite a few shortcomings in usability though. The kinetic scrolling for one - it doesn't have enough momentum and stops way too abruptly. The tap-to-zoom feature switches between three levels of zoom: 30%, 100% and 200%. Strangely, it was a little hard to trigger, so you are better off using the zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a page full screen or bringing up the minimap requires two taps, which is exactly a click more than it should have been. And while the browser has support for multiple pages opened at the same time, this only works for popups - you can't open a new tab manually and dial in a new web address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the page rendering is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed on a desktop PC. The high resolution is also a welcome bonus here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen. There is also a login auto-fill interface that really makes logging online that much easier on a device without a physical keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the web browser has full support for both Flash and Java, which means that you can enjoy flash videos straight in your browser without having to use the mobile versions of sites like YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of speed the browser performs very well but when viewing a YouTube video it would often show a "memory low" warning. The videos still played smoothly though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the second S60 touch-browser is nicely equipped but fails to address some basic usability shortcomings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer - good old Symbian organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 organizer didn't get tweaked that much for the new OS beyond basic touch optimization. Well, developers were right up to a point but - given the progress of most competitors - some new functionality would have been nice like copy/paste of events in the calendar or a new calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit though that the calculator is much more comfortable to operate with fingers than with a D-pad, almost as if it was designed for such use from the very beginning. Now let's just hope new non-touchscreen devices get something better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and to-do, which allows you to check up all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are the same four types of events available for setting up as on S60 3rd edition - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also highly functional with preinstalled viewers for Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. The PDF viewer was preinstalled on our unit but it's only a 15-day trial version (duh!) and after that you need to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, editing documents is not supported on the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to buy the additional license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications are half useful, half a gimmick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled applications in the Sony Ericsson Satio include RoadSync, MyLook and SMS Preview. There's also a dedicated voice-guided navigation software, which we'll cover in a later section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DataViz RoadSync is among the most useful preinstalled applications if you plan on using your Satio in a corporate environment. In essence, it's an ActiveSync client, which provides secure, wireless and direct push synchronization of corporate e-mail, calendar, contacts, tasks and attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MyLook is a fun little app, which runs in the background and changes the wallpaper. It works in one of three modes - timer (changes the wallpaper after a set period of time), shake (shake the phone to change the wallpaper), or based on your temporary location (the current cell ID).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-based option is interesting, here's how it works: it uses Cell ID to detect your position and changes the wallpaper based on that. This allows you to have the wallpaper changed automatically based on whether you're at work or at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS Preview is a handy tool, which previews incoming SMS messages on the homescreen so you won't even have to unlock the phone to read the message. You can set up how long the preview lasts. To start using SMS Preview though, you have to activate the app, which requires sending a single international SMS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games department offers two puzzles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two games preinstalled on the Satio - Labyrinth and Sudoku. Labyrinth has the same premise as HTC's Teeter game - by tilting the phone, you guide a ball to an end point avoiding traps along the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some new obstacles on the way but the essence is the same. The maze is rendered in 3D and the camera shifts position as you tilt the phone. Unfortunately, it does so with noticeable lag, which somewhat breaks the illusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second game Sudoku is self-explanatory. It introduces a slight RPG element by letting you create a character with which you can earn prizes and trophies displayed on a shelf in a virtual cafe. You can create or join online cafes to show off your trophies. There's also an extensive tutorial in case you've never played Sudoku before.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation talks you through<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is nothing spectacular - it managed to get a lock from a cold start in a couple of minutes but we had to go out into an open area. It wouldn't get a lock on the balcony of our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Satio is equipped with a Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect from a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead are downloaded over the air. A flat data fee is recommended but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation. Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well, like with Nokia Maps. It really would have helped in avoiding data roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass, like on most of its competitors, to facilitate navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson need a winner right now and the Satio is the phone carrying the torch. It's equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, which puts it in an elite club. It failed to become the founding member of the club - that title goes to the Samsung Pixon12 - but the Satio offers a level of extra versatility available only on smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look away from the camera for a moment though - we paid it plenty of attention in our 12-megapixel shootout. The smartphone capabilities do deserve praise as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Satio runs on the same "engine" as the iPhone 3GS, Omnia HD, Palm Pre and Nokia N900 - an ARM Cortex A8 CPU running at 600MHz along with a PowerVR SGX graphics accelerator. Symbian OS is known to run merrily on much lower-clocked CPUs and with more horsepower it multitasks like a champ. It also sports a brand new look, which certainly helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But all that platform talk renders the obvious competitor of the Satio a bit obscure. Yes, the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is currently the archrival but the 12-megapixel camera is the only ground where these two phones face off. Yes, the Pixon12 offers GPS voice-guided navigation and Wi-Fi, a WVGA AMOLED screen and smooth and silky TouchWiz - but it's not as versatile and flexible as the Satio's smartness. The Pixon12 beat the Satio in a pretty close game but it was the cameraphone that lost, not the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M8910 Pixon12</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the Samsung M8920, the worldwide version of the Samsung W880 AMOLED 12M, finally comes out, pressure on the Satio will grow. The M8920 won't be a smartphone either but optical zoom will sure tip the scales. Until then, have a look at our preview of the W880 to get a taste of what's coming next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M8920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going down a notch in the camera department, we find a whole bunch of 8-megapixel options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is a ready and willing candidate. Its camera is probably as impressive, but in another way - the still unmatched 720p video recording. The bigger (and AMOLED) screen is worth noting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8910 Omnia HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the real promise is in the recent stir-up at the high end of the Sony Ericsson portfolio. We guess, phones like the Satio and the much-awaited Rachael give credence to the company's efforts for a comeback. The Sony Ericsson top dogs really need to pull their ranks together to stand up to the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Satio lost the race for the first 12MP cameraphone on the market, but maybe it's not too late to win the race for widespread adoption. There's certainly a great deal of hype around it and the phone manages to live up to a lot of it. Of course it will be up to the mid-range reinforcements to follow Satio, Aino and Rachael to claw back some of the market share the company has lost over the last couple of years. But things may as well be looking brighter already with Satio leading the way.</paragraph>
