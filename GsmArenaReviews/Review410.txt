			<paragraph>Qtek S100 (HTC Magician) has finally found its appropriate successor. Qtek S200 (HTC Prophet) offers a new OS, EDGE and Wi-Fi support, and a top-class display. Are you dreaming of a versatile communicator no bigger than a common smart phone?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let me just say a few explanatory words about the HTC platform that all these communicators are based on. HTC is the company that actually manufactures all the devices and brands them according to the client. Each series of devices is based on one and the same platform but then gets sold under different brand, for example- Qtek (which is owned by HTC itself), i-mate, Dopod, O2, T-Mobile, Orange. The differences among devices of the same platform are minimal. In this review we will take a look at Qtek S200, which is based on the HTC Prophet platform. The review stands true for all other devices based on the same platform such as i-mate JAMin, O2 XDA Neo, Dopod 818 Pro, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The presentation of Qtek S100 in the autumn of 2004 made everybody, having anything to do with the Windows Mobile platform, rejoice. The device is exceptionally small, even though it does not have any special or new technological functions. Among Qtek 2020 (HTC Himalaya) and Qtek 9090 (HTC Blue Angel), S100 looks like David among Goliaths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, it became clear that it was not only size that had undergone modifications. There had also been made several minor changes with a view to make navigation more pleasant in general. Thanks to the DialPad and the phone's virtual keypad one can finally dial numbers or write text messages without having to pull out a touchscreen pointer. In any case, it is important to point out that Compact was designed to be used with the Windows Mobile 2003 OS, which was the reason for the somewhat awkward controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here it is: the new Qtek S200, the real successor of the compact line of PocketPC models, running on Windows Mobile 5.0 and having Wi-Fi connectivity and a 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; All-side view at HTC Prophet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qtek S100 has been on the market for a little while. There is no doubt that the number of the original S100 owners is still significantly higher. I personally own a HTC Magician device, which I have been using for more than a year now, so I cannot restrain myself from making direct comparison between both models. As you will see, there are plenty of differences worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Black suits it perfectly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Following a silver version, a dark blue one and even a pink one, now comes a refined, elegant black model. Size has only been modified slightly. Qtek S200 is wider by a millimeter, while the other two dimensions have been changed to an extent even less recognizable, that is, by a fragment of the millimeter. Weight has been kept the same despite the different construction materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the S100 model with a body covered with a thin metal alloy, Qtek is entirely made of plastic only, which is, to my modest opinion, a step backwards. Let me give you an example: I saw the old model fall onto concrete after having been inaccurately inserted into its case and it continued working seamlessly after the accident. In case of a fall of a purely plastic construction on such a hard surface I would definitely expect an impact with more severe consequences. Yet, I should point out that in no way do the Qtek S200's plastic covers look cheap or fragile; just on the contrary, they look perfectly solid and well-elaborated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some photos show Qtek S200 with a silver tucker around its control buttons. The tucker around the five-way control key of the test model, however, is black. I myself like our version better. The phone's body is entirely black, except for three silver buttons and the speaker grill. The black overall design is additionally brightened up by a few silver elements on the rear side of the device: a mirror for self-portraits, a frame around the camera lens, and the background of the 2 megapixel camera sign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key revolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek's body is literally covered with control buttons. Their distribution however does not differ much from the way the controls were located in Compact. Most significant modifications are to be found in the set of buttons beneath the display. The five-way control button has been rounded, while the separated central button has been left unchanged. The main navigation D-pad is elaborated superbly. Here you will also find the two obligatory receiver keys, red and green, slightly elevated and thus providing for easier touch orientation in case of incoming calls. To my opinion, however, the unobtrusive buttons located between the main controller and the two receivers are far more interesting than their surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the main navigation D-pad there are two buttons marked with dashes, which serve as soft-keys for the new OS. Nothing new under the sun... Far more interesting are the keys beneath the main control button. For the first time here you will find a key with a flag pictogram (the Windows key which opens the Start menu) and an OK key, which either confirms the respective selected option, or minimizes currently opened application. We will say more about what impact these keys have onto the overall user-friendliness of Qtek S200 further on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the elements on the body are distributed in a more or less standard way, that is, just like in the original Compact model. Let's start from the right side. In its bottom part is situated the infrared port, which remains the simplest method (compared to Bluetooth, for example) for small-file transfers, even if already considered somewhat out-of-date. In the top part you will see both the switch-on button and the pointer aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is another interesting detail: the stylus does not stand pretty firmly in its bed; to pull it out simply run your thumb along the upper part of the right edge of the phone. It will not take you long before you also become used to switch on the communicator simultaneously with the pull-out of the stylus. It is simple, fast, and elegant; a solution far better than the one used in the Qtek 9100 model, where one has to use their nail in order to pull out the attached telescopic stylus, while the switch-on button is situated on the opposite side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A slot here, an earphone there?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The top edge of Qtek S200 is rather plain. The only element to be found here is the SD/MMC card slot. On the front, above the display you will see the speaker, marked with two LEDs. The upper one of the two blinks in green when the device has signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a resident of a small remote village with unreliable signal reception I strongly appreciate the presence of the above mentioned LED (just like in the old good Ericsson models). It blinks in orange when a new SMS has been received, a call has been missed, or a reminder has been activated. The same color is applied when the device is being charged. The bottom LED becomes active when Bluetooth (blue) or Wi-Fi (green) is activated. If you run both wireless technologies, the LED blinks consecutively in blue and green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side there are two buttons and a two-positional switch. The latter modifies the volume levels of either the earphones (during conversation), or the speaker. If moved to the very bottom end, the button either switches the communicator to vibration mode, or hushes it completely. Beneath the switch there is a button that activates the interface for wireless data transfers. The button located above starts the camera application, an option I eventually deactivated as I happened to press the button by mistake far too often. The location of the camera button on the body of the original S100 model, it did not disturb me at all, probably due to its smaller size and deeper bed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the rear side of Qtek S200 you will find the lens of its 2MP digital camera. I'll say more about the camera application later on in the review. Both a mirror for self-portraits and an external antenna connector are available, too. Under the plastic cover of the rear side you will find a large Li-Ion Polymer battery with a capacity of 1200 mAh. Contrary to previous models, the Qtek S200 battery does not get reset automatically when the rear cover of the phone is removed. SIM card is inserted under the batter, just like in the old Qtek S100. Putting it in is relatively easy, while taking it out requires the use of a sharp object. You need to first lift the card and then draw it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synchronizing miniUSB connector is located in the bottom part of the device. It can be used not only for synchronization, but also for charging Qtek S200, for example through USB HUB 2.0, using a charging adapter of one's own. During the tests of Qtek S200 I did not come to need the charging adapter, but it would surely come in handy during a holiday, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the synchronizing connector you will find an earphone 2.5mm jack for attaching the stereo headset available in Qtek S200's original box. If you are a serious music fan, you may want to connect a pair of your own earphones using an adapter. In the bottom part there is also a slot for soft-reset and the microphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display glows stronger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200's display represents a truly pleasant surprise, even though it does not offer a VGA resolution, nor is it exceptionally big. It is the same 2.8-inch display with a QVGA resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, which is identical to the resolution applied in today's common mobile phones. Considering the diameter of Qtek S200's display, a VGA resolution would have probably been far too high. At the same time, a choice of another resolution could have been a step towards unreliable compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Qtek S200 display surprises with great quality: white is pretty white, colors are generally deep; contrast is perfect. Backlighting is even. Compared to Qtek S100, 9100 or even 9000 (which has VGA displays), Qtek S200 is the undisputed champion in brightness. Legibility under direct sunlight is very good, much better than the one of Qtek S100 display, on which smaller letters are really hard to recognize. Well, to be more precise, the legibility of Qtek S200's display is not excellent, just like it happens to be with all color displays. In terms of touchpad display usability and functionality, however, it is simply the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am sure that on sunny days you will really appreciate the maximum brightness setting of the display. At the same time, the lowest brightness level has its usage as well, for example during night driving. While I find the maximum brightness of Qtek S200's display excellent, I consider its minimum levels still quite high. The brightness option has four levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OS and innovations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In comparison to Windows Mobile 2003SE Windows Mobile 5 brings a few major changes, all of them rather invisible for having been carried out inside the device. On the other hand, as you will be able to see further on in the review, not all previous issues have been successfully addressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first and most important change is the different mode in which the new OS works with memory management. This pocket computer is equipped with two types of operational memory: RAM and Flash ROM. RAM is faster, but requires a constant energy flow. Flash ROM offers a far lower memory speed than RAM, but is able to work independently on energy supply. Both the Windows Mobile 2003SE OS and other OS usually work with Flash ROM when it comes to storing the OS files. If there is any space left, the manufacturers would usually offer it as storage memory for user files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RAM (usually with a twice as large capacity as the Flash ROM) was then distributed quite fairly (a subject to changes on behalf of the user) between space for user data (such as a computer's hard disk) and space for running applications (such as a computer's RAM). This way, once started, an application was transferred from the Flash ROM to the RAM, or alternatively from the memory card into RAM and everything was OK as long as the battery supplied the memory with energy. What happened in reality, was that numerous users would come back home after two-week holiday and would find their communicator completely discharged with the factory settings reapplied. Due to lack of energy the RAM had got deleted, including all important data, applications and documents saved in it. My own MDA Compact (HTC Magician, like Qtek S100), which works with WM 2003SE, sometimes resets itself when SIM card is quickly replaced. I was even told a case when Compact reset itself after a memory card had been inserted in it. In other words, the OS was in need of a serious modification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile 5, however, works in a different way. The distribution ration between RAM and Flash ROM has been made the other way round, that is Qtek S200 has twice more Flash ROM than older devices. OS uses up to 40-50 MB of Flash ROM. The rest of the space is left to cover user data. In this situation RAM only serves the necessities of running applications. In result of the above mentioned modifications one does not need to worry about how much data they could save directly into the device, instead of the memory card. And secondly, a possible discharge of the device does not imply the risk of losing one's important information (pretty negative news for back-up programs, btw). The true inconvenience here is the low speed of Flash ROM. The difference in speed between Flash ROM and RAM is less evident when applications are installed onto the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS shows significant delays when particular pre-installed applications are run, like the calendar, for example. I even dare to evaluate Qtek S200's calendar as slow, as a mere switch between the day, the week and the month views takes 4 long seconds, even if the whole application is saved in RAM. In Qtek S100, for example, work with the calendar application was lightning fast. The main reason for S200's slow work is to be found in the combination of the new OS and the slower processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mode of communication between a pocket computer and a PC implies another recently made modification. The original specific communication has been replaced by TCP/IP protocol. In other words, the pocket computer operates as if it was a standard computer connected through the use of a network card. According to officially published information on Qtek S200, the advantage of this change is visible in the higher speed of synchronization (not very notable in practice, though). Yet, certain complications could occur as a result of the "stubbornness" of firewall, which can, in given specific situations, ban the communication between PDA and PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Control has undergone certain modifications, too. One can finally move vertically from one icon to another, a message is possible to write and send without having to pull out the stylus etc. In any case, certain drawbacks still linger on in Qtek S200, which position Treo 650, for example, far better in this aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Newly emerged is also the combination of two office applications: Word Mobile and Excel Mobile. Both programs support a far bigger range of documents, improving this way the overall compatibility of the communicator. One of the most frequently raised questions in this field refers to older applications compatibility. There are designers who launch modified versions of old, somewhat forgotten applications, which are however often incompatible with new OS. The greatest difficulty users usually meet has to do with the bottom system bar, which, in certain applications, overlaps the menu elements bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of Qtek S200 I highly miss the option of hand-written notes to be attached to both events and tasks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Easy control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Doubtlessly, the new OS facilitates a lot the control of the device without the necessity of using a stylus. At the same time, manufacturers tend to not pay enough attention to users' aftermarket needs. The Windows Mobile 5 OS is only controllable without a stylus in case that hardware keys have been assigned the OK/Close and Start functions, a crucial detail, which manufacturers seem not to bare in mind. Qtek 9100 is the perfect example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the above mentioned functions have been assigned to the respective keys, 9100 becomes relatively comfortable to control. And trust me that I know why I am using exactly the word "relatively"...those keys are just located much too far... In this order of thoughts Qtek is the first communicator of its series, where designers seem to have thought details over after having tested the device in practice. The evidence of their efforts is the two unobtrusive buttons mounted beneath the five-way controller, which convert the control process into real pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, a major part of daily used applications can be run and used without using the stylus. Nevertheless, one still finds gaps; for example, the switch between received and sent messages is unthinkable without the stylus. Even though Qtek S200 has more than one of these drawbacks, I can honestly say that stylus usage has been minimized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Writing on the display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 has no hidden numeric keypad. Text is inserted by means of the touchpad display. Just to be sure, please let me repeat how this is done for all those not acquainted with PocketPC input modes. Those familiar, please, feel free to skip the following pair of paragraphs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you need to insert text, use the virtual mobile phone keypad. On the display you will see large keys representing functions similar to those offered in any common handset. The writing process alone is carried out by tapping with thumb on the display (it is here, where you will come to appreciate the protecting folio, on which fingerprints are less visible.). At the beginning you will probably experience certain discomfort as keys give no physical feedback. In general, however, a slight touch is sufficient for the respective character to be written down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What creates more problems is the lack of borders between keys, due to which your thumb has nothing tangible to distinguish the keys. To me personally, getting used to writing on S100 took me a few months. But once I had caught the right technique, I was able to write on the touchscreen as fast as I would do on the standard keypad of any common mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another writing option available in Qtek is the small QWERTY keypad with its truly petty keys, manageable through the use of a stylus only. I have to confess, however, that choosing the right key costs me enormous efforts, even if I am at the quietest and calmest place possible. In MHD, for example, this type of writing comes naturally. Windows Mobile is designed to also recognize hand written characters, an option, which I myself found hard to get accustomed to. Yet I know users who literally love it. The last option available is called Transcriber, that is, a program, which recognizes written characters, including entire hand-written words. To my opinion, Transcriber is the least reliable writing method among all above mentioned options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, let me point out that any hardware keypad is generally better than all soft-methods of text input taken together. If you usually write longer emails, chat on ICQ or write novels, then make sure you pay a special attention to Qtek 9100 as its keypad is praiseworthy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let us now take a closer look at Qtek S200 as "a common mobile phone". Qtek S200 is equipped with a communication module supporting 850/900/1800/1900 MHz GSM frequency bands. In other words, it meets even the requirements of travelers to remote destinations. The shared memory does not limit in any way the number of the contacts stored. Each name can be assigned dozens of fields. Two new fields have been added with the launching of the new Windows Mobile 5 OS: a picture and a ringing melody (both of which used to be supplied through an external application in older OS. All contacts, including all fields attached to them, get seamlessly synchronized with Outlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing process is fast: you need to switch on the communicator, press the green receiver, which opens the virtual keypad; here you have to look up the respective contact ("T9" fastens up the entire process) and dial it by another press on the green receiver. Searching process using "T9" is similar to message writing. The key with the letter included in the searched name should only be pressed once. The phone then starts to automatically filter all corresponding contacts, no matter whether you have entered the first or the last name of the searched person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 can be setup to alert about incoming calls by a melody in WAV format, by a MP3 file, or by WMA and vibrations. As to the state-of-art call functions, here I sort of miss ringing profiles (applications like PhoneAlarm and PocketZenPhone are possible to install additionally). I would have not turned down call filtering either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Bluetooth Qtek S200 communicates smoothly with a wireless hands-free (personally tested on Nokia BH-200). Available also is a built-in handsfree (with a long press of the green receiver for about 2 seconds) and a light headset that comes along with the communicator. Sound is rather tinny, lacking bass elements, and generally deserves a rather lower mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the beginning, communicators based on the Windows Mobile 5 platform used to have problems with call receiving speed. The first versions of Qtek 9100 were especially bad: if, for example, it was to receive a call while running a rather complicated application, it would really take it plenty of time before it displayed the information bubble and reacted to the press on the green receiver. In this respect Qtek S200 shows no problems. Ringing tone is heard immediately, even in case of simultaneously running energy-consuming video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS and emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 combines email client and SMS/MMS editors into one single application called Inbox. Here you will find three folders; with SMS, MMS, and Outlook emails. The latter covers messages synchronized with Outlook. If you create a new email inside this folder, it gets saved onto the PDA and sent away as soon as you start a new synchronizing procedure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal email accounts can be created in an application called Inbox. It supports the IMAP/POP3 email protocols. Each email message created in this folder is sent instantly. Optional automatic control on fixed intervals is available as well. Attachments can be both received and sent out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to SMS, modifications are scarce. The only change worth mentioning is the unlimited storage capacity for both incoming and outgoing messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one feature I did like in Nokia Communicator: if a message could not be sent because of poor signal reception, the phone would automatically send it once the signal level returns to normal. I strongly miss this function in Qtek S200.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old processor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 is driven by the good old Texas Instruments OMAP850 processor at a frequency of 195 MHz. In reality, few pocket computer processors have raised so wild discussions as this one. Some hate it, others love it. What is doubtless, however, is its high integration level. As you can see in the picture below, nearly all functions of this pocket computer are backed up by a single chip. It is no wonder then that HTC has decided to apply exactly this type of processor: one chip simply means lower production costs. Yet, this doesn't seem to have had any notable impact on the final price of the communicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless to what people say, my personal opinion is that these 200 MHz are insufficient to drive an OS like Windows Mobile 5. The processor shows significant lags in carrying out relatively common tasks, for example work with calendar or opening the mail folder. Even when the calendar has already been read into the memory of the device, switching between individual views takes ages. A test of Fujitsu-Siemens Loox N560 with Intel XScale PXA270 processor of 624 MHz immediately after the testing of Qtek S200 feels like replacing an East-German Trabant with a Formula 1 racing car. Of course, 624 MHz is an extreme power with extreme energy consumption, but still, an Intel processor working at a frequency of 412 MHz would have been more than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Qtek S100 plays videos in DivX format seamlessly (resolution for PC and a bitrate of slightly more than 1 Mbps), Qtek obligates you to reconvert all video records into a resolution of 320 pixels in order to achieve a bitrate of 250 kbps. Lags were present in a few other energy-consuming applications as well. Qtek S200 requires a significant dose of patience especially in case of auto navigation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest memory and card usage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both OS and applications are located on 128MB Flash ROM. The OS uses a major part of this memory space; user is then left with a bit over 47 MB, which is relatively enough for applications and documents, but not for storing the pictures from the built-in 2MP camera. In order to use more complicated applications (like navigation, multimedia (music, video) you will have to get yourself an additional memory card. Qtek S200 is equipped with a SD memory card slot. In other words, this is good news for owners of older big-capacity cards. If, on the contrary, you are still only a potential memory card buyer, I recommend you to get yourself a smaller one (miniSD) together with a plastic adapter for SD slot, because new communicators tend to give up on big SD slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RAM is said to have a capacity of 64 MB. Only 44 MB of all 64 are available though. After the soft-reset the OS and the two resident applications (SPB Pocket plus a Pocket Controller), which I had additionally installed, "ate up" 21 MB and I got left 23MB. During the tests of Qtek S200 I did not manage to use them all, yet memory that remained free was not much. Here we can talk about one of the major changes brought about by the new OS against the older ones, as user doesn't have to worry anymore about which application can or cannot be saved into the phone memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bluetooth and Wi-Fi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 features the long awaited Wi-Fi. The card supports the standard 802.11b, that is, a maximum speed of 11 Mbit/s. Qtek 9000 (HTC Universal) offers a simple method of converting a "B" card into a "G" card by a single intervention into the correspondent register. The sensitivity of the wireless card is average. The disappointment I experienced with sensitivity levels of the Wi-Fi card in Qtek 9000 made me expect similar difficulties with S200. Fortunately, my fears turned out to be in vain. Microsoft, though, deserves a few serious critics for its complicated setup of DHCP-free network connection, which would make any beginner sweat for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 1.2 technology is of course available in a high-class communicator like Qtek S200. The technology alone works smoothly: connectivity range is pretty good; communication with accessories is seamless. The only difficulty I ran into had to do with the activation of the wireless synchronization, but its origin was to be sought in the PC I was using, not in the communicator. For example, connection with the wireless earphone or the Bluetooth GPS receiver ran trouble-free. What a pity the Microsoft interface is so austere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data transfers, Internet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main advantage of any communicator lies in its ability to transfer data. Considering the comfortable size of this type of mobile devices, you can virtually enjoy internet access anywhere at any time. In this aspect, the GPRS technology of Class 10 is a doubtless priority. Besides, mobile operators continue to extend the territorial coverage of EDGE technology, which provides for a transfer speed three times higher then the one achieved by GPRS - approximately 120 Kbps. Qtek S200, however, supports neither UMTS, nor HSDPA. If any of you feels nostalgic and prefers to use the CSD dial up, Qtek will serve you good, too. Yet, the device lacks a very usable option, HSCSD /High Speed CSD/.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here we have data connection. How should we make the most use of it? The built-in email client manages important mail, while the internet browser, which supports all modern standards, provides access to full-function internet service. Considering the size of the display I recommend you to look for optimized pages, even though the browser is designed to manage common websites. There are also several RSS readers available for Windows Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are a instant messaging user, feel free to additionally install ICQ, Jabber, AOL or any other chat program. Besides, Qtek S200 maintains GPRS connection even when switched off enabling this way constant on-line mode, including the possibility of regular email check or continuous availability of news through RSS channels. There are also other clients designed especially for Windows Mobile, which provide access to FTP servers, Terminal Service, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia, music, and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Communicators based on Windows Mobile are not meant to be business only devices for managers or technical workers. They could also be used as ideal multimedia centers. It all depends, however, on available applications. Currently, the biggest existing application portal is offering somewhat less than 30 thousand applications designed to be used with Windows Mobile platform. The picture browser is part of the OS. Nevertheless, you can download another, better one that would feature more functions for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video application is one of those favorite in any communicator. Qtek S200, for example, is able to fit in an entire movie or a series of shorter videos as long as there is enough free memory. There are programs, which can modify a film in DVD format into a format suitable for use in a pocket computer through the press of several buttons. One would then hardly get bored during long trips to school or work. What's more, instead of getting angry while waiting for their dates. men can finally have fun. Besides, new communicators are powerful enough to play music of high quality. The only limit still present is the available free memory space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200 features one additional drawback, that is its 2.5 mm Jack, which requires the usage of an adapter if earphones different from the original ones are to be attached to the device. The sound quality is sufficient, making listening to music a rather pleasant experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qtek S200's 2 MP camera has been an unexpected surprise both for me and for my colleagues. It makes pictures in a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. Lower resolution options of 1280 x 1024, 640 x 480, 320 x 240, and 160 x 120 pixels are also available. It seems however, that the test communicator we were provided with suffers a certain firmware defect since all picture we took feature strange vertical lines in their right end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the center and the edges of all pictures are perfectly sharp. Colors come out pretty true. The automatic exposure compensation works well, too. What's more, we compared Qtek S200's pictures with images taken with Sony Ericsson K750, which was considered to be the king among all 2 MP camera phones. As expected, Sony Ericsson remains the best, mainly due to its brilliant automatic focusing system. Yet, there were several pictures taken with Qtek S200, which I personally liked more for their lower noise level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, Qtek S200 only creates hi-quality images under favorable light conditions. Otherwise its photo abilities tend to vanish away. The lack of an additional LED, which could have helped in certain low light situations, is not irrelevant, either. Qtek S200 reproduces well all types of close-distance objects, including texts. Next to the silver frame around the camera lens there are two pictograms, a flower one, and a rock one. In order to make the communicator create perfect macro images, you need to setup lens physical properties by half-rotating the correspondent circle. A similar fixed focus macro mode is also used in many other mobiles nowadays.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Qtek S200 is sold together with a practical cloth case with an eye-let for hanging stripe. In the original box you will also find a network adapter, a synchronizing cable, and a light handsfree set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A successful successor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Qtek S200 is at no doubt a well made communicator, representing a significant step ahead as regards the forerunner S100. It offers a new OS, EDGE support, a far more comfortable controls, and, in most cases, an unrivalled display. There are only two matters worth my negative comment: the plastic body and the slow processor speed (unable to meet certain more specific requirements).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up until now I have remained a faithful owner of MDA Compact. Neither did I replace it with Qtek 9100, nor with S110 or 9000. The new Qtek S200 however threw me into serious thoughts. I think the right time to replace my old communicator for a new one has finally come.</paragraph>
