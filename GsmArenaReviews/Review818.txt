			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola has done it again. The Moto G made quite the stir in the midrange and the story continues. The next one's up - and this time it's even cheaper. With a 4.3" display of qHD resolution, a dual-core processor, 5MP camera, and a solid 1,980mAh battery, the Motorola Moto E may as well be the ultimate budget phone. One that will probably sell by itself with a ?100 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back with the Moto G, Motorola managed to disrupt the market for quite a while, making otherwise solid competitors look overpriced and underequipped. Built to a budget but delivering above, the Moto G was one of the unlikely heroes of last season - and continues to exploit the winning formula with new versions adding extra stuff like memory expansion and LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto E launches straight on Android 4.4 KitKat, which is optimized to run on even modest hardware. A phone of the Moto E's caliber is probably what Google had in mind when designing the KitKat update and little wonder, the Moto E is one of the first entry level phones to take advantage. Even though Motorola is soon to be ex-Google's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola is also offering the Moto E in dual-SIM flavor plus you can buy whatever colorful rear cover you like and freshen up your phone anytime. Before we continue with our detailed review, let's take a look at the Moto E key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You didn't expect top technology in a ?89 smartphone, did you? Of course, the Moto E is bound to lack a feature or two, but that was expected. Motorola never intended to give you a top of the line handset, but the basics are all covered - making calls, texting, emails, social integration, media playback, taking pictures and access to most of the Play Store apps. Android KitKat will make sure it's a smooth ride (most of the time, at least).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Moto E is a snappy budget phone of attractive design and the latest OS version. What could go wrong, right? Our traditional hardware inspection follows right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Motorola Moto E<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola, just like with Moto G, is selling the Moto E in a very tiny retail box, which houses only the phone itself and a USB cable. There is no wall charger, nor is there a headset. Whatever you need more, you'll have to buy one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, the retail package contents may vary across different markets. In our case, we picked up our Moto E from a retail store in the UK so our observations would certainly be valid there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Moto E 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moto E spreads at 124.8 x 64.8 x 12.3 mm and weighs 142g - a footprint very similar to Moto G's but 5mm shorter and a gram lighter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E utilizes a clean, simplistic design, which however lacks any character whatsoever. That's not to say that the Moto E is bad-looking, but it completely fails to grab the eye in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is covered by a protective glass, and in Moto E's case that's the latest generation Gorilla Glass 3. The removable rear cover is made of matte plastic which isn't prone to fingerprints and smudges. Finally, there is the glossy framing bordering the display, which might not be helping for a good grip, but surely looks nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Moto E build quality is not up to very high standards. The different parts and panels just don't seem to fit like it should.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover, for instance, fails to fit the middle section properly and not only does it give out the occasional creaks and squeaks, but it also moves around a bit under your fingers, which leaves a rather cheap impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A second example is the way the middle section fits around the front panel. The translucent frame we mentioned earlier has a substantial gap that allows all sorts of dirt and whatnot enter there and it's a rather tricky place to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a 4.3" smartphone puts the Moto E in the pocket-friendly category. It isn't thick or bulky, yet its 142 grams would have made for a solid feel in your hand if it wasn't for the flimsy battery cover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto e 4.3" qHD display isn't among the best units we've seen, but it's certainly among the best this price bracket has on offer. The pixel density is 256ppi, which qualifies for a sharp enough images and easy reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is not that bright, but to make matters worse, its surface is very reflective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are good with acceptable color washing, though the reflectiveness gets in the way of the viewing experience if you are not looking at the screen straight on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Disregarding the effect of the reflectivity, the display panel's contrast turned out very good thanks to the deep blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Moto E's display is very reflective and you'll have a hard time in those sunny days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E has no hardware controls at the front, you control everything with the on-screen controls provided by Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece and the loudspeaker are both flanking the display, protected by glossy silver bars. The proximity and ambient light sensors are also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the primary microphone is also hidden below the bottom silver plastic element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Moto E houses the power/lock key and the volume rocker, both made from glossy silver plastic. There is nothing on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary noise-cancelling microphone are on top of the Moto E, while the bottom has the lonely microUSB slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The centered 5MP fixed-focus camera lens is at the back accompanied by the Motorola's logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover, which is a bit of a hassle and fingernail work, reveals the microSIM and microSD slots. You can hot-swap the microSD card anytime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto E features a 1,980mAh battery, but Motorola didn't specify how long it is expected to last. The capacity isn't too big, but given the efficient chipset and relatively small screen, we were quite optimistic about its prospects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto E had below average power draw on stand-by, but did well on the rest of our tests. This helped it to a final endurance rating of 60 hours, which means the Moto E will last exactly two and a half days if you do an hour of calls, an hour of video watching and an hour of web browsing each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Motorola Moto E battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto E is available in single and dual SIM versions. The dual SIM variety has two distinct versions for different markets. Here's the list of supported bands by model:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM-enabled Moto E supports dual stand-by, but does not support dual call. This means that once you get a call on any of the SIM cards, the other one becomes inaccessible for the duration of the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One particular connectivity feature is reserved only for the XT1025 dual-SIM Moto E - Digital TV. This model is strictly limited to very few markets though so we guess the supported Digital TV standard is tailored to the services available in these markets only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features available across all models include single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi hotspot. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable. The Moto E doesn't support USB OTG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, but if own a compatible HDTV, you can output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto E runs sweet KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E runs pure Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. Motorola has started seeding the 4.4.3 bug fix update in early June, so it should be available everywhere by the time you are reading this. Motorola does not provide any custom additions to the vanilla Android, which is one of the reasons the Moto lineup is treated with Nexus-fast Android updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), plus there is a shortcut to the camera at the bottom courtesy of Android KitKat. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto E allows for five homescreen panes. You can't change their arrangement nor can you add or remove panes. Adding stuff on the homescreen is easy, as is customizing it. You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification center is the usual stock Android one and Quick toggles are available via a shortcut to the right. You can get straight to these by with a two-finger swipe from the top of the screen. From there you get access to key device settings such as brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, location, mobile networks and Battery. Some toggles are directly accessible shortcuts to their respected functions in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple side-scrollable panes. The apps are sorted alphabetically followed by the available widgets. Moto E doesn't support custom sorting for the app drawer, nor is there an option to remove the widgets panes, which come right after the app ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recent Apps switcher is the same as on any other Android device. It would be nice if Google finally adds a kill all/close all option to this screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E is running on the Snapdragon 200 budget chipset. It offers two Cortex-A7 CPU cores, Adreno 302 graphics and 1GB of RAM. This should provide about half the raw power the quad-core Moto G has under the hood, but hopefully the lower resolution will make up for the loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Moto E posted an OK result on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. While the score pales in comparison to the latest Krait processors, the Moto E matched the performance of the similarly powered Galaxy Core LTE and Ace 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. The Moto E numbers are quite good, a whisker below than the quad-core Cortex-A7-powered Xperia C.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall score and the dedicated CPU scores. The Moto E overall rating is quite poor, the singe-core performance is on par with other Cortex-A7-based chipsets, while the multi-core performance is, quite expectedly, twice as low as that by the quad-core Cortex-A7 phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results turned out better than we expected. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected a performance level, which is very close to the Moto G and HTC One mini 2 scores. The lower qHD screen resolution surely helped here as the Moto E has some 40% less pixels to draw than the Moto G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BrowserMark 2.1 tests HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Motorola Moto E managed a good score in BrowserMark but rather poor in Kraken, though botch scores are close to the Snapdragon 400-powered Sony Xperia M2 and HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E and its Snapdragon 200 chipset offer good overall performance for its price and specs, even though its scores are quite uninspiring as numbers. What really matters is real-life usage - we certainly had a few cases where the Moto E froze or experienced some hiccups (the Camera app being the main culprit), we still feel the smartphone delivers a snappy performance for its price range. The Android KitKat OS is responsive, web browsing as quick as you would expect, popular games run fine and you can't ask for much more at this price point .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is the stock Android app People, which hasn't been much changed since its major redesign last year with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich. It uses tabbed interface with Favorites, Contacts and Groups as separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar. Quick Contacts features is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality with the Moto E is decent, the earpiece is loud enough with clear voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.4 KitKat dialer app supports smart dial. Upon launch it brings you to its default dialing tab where you get a search field, the most recent dialed contact and a list of contacts you've dialed most often. You can bring up or hide the dialer by its dedicated shortcut at the bottom. It supports smart dialing both by name and phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E is among the few phones to score an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you won't be missing calls and notifications even in the noisiest of environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS. Google's hangouts is also on board, it supports SMS too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto E relies on the default Google keyboard for text input. It supports Swype-like gesture input, personalized dictionary, auto-correction and lots of languages. You can use Google's voice input too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two galleries at your disposal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android 4.4 KitKat offers two gallery apps - the default Gallery and the recently introduced Photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app shows all of the photos on your phone sorted by albums. There is a pop up menu, which allows sorting you images by time, by album or just limit your image access to camera roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of sharing options, plus a capable integrated image editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app is the latest gallery app Google is trying to push lately. It integrates with Google+ and can backup your images automatically to your Google+ account if you like. It also shows all the photos from your online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you sign in with your Google+ account, you can also use the Auto Awesome feature - it combines similar photos and videos in a cool way - it either exports a collage picture or a motion gif. If you like the combination the gallery has made for you, there is a dedicated shortcut to save the new picture in the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player integrated within the Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is still not getting the necessary attention from Google and there's still no dedicated videos app (you have to go through the Gallery or Photos). The only supported format is MP4 up to 1080p resolution. That's it. There is no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Streaming videos to a Wi-Fi enabled TV is available. One way to go about this is to share your multimedia content over good ol' DLNA technology OR you can mirror your device's screen to the TV via the Miracast protocol (Cast screen is the name of the option).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Music plays the music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music handles your music collection. It features the spanking New Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music also gives you the option to upload music onto the Google-branded cloud and stream it on your device via Wi-Fi or mobile data. There's also the nifty option of downloading the content onto the device if you want to have there for connection-less times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several equalizer presets along with a custom user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play around with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM Radio is a pretty straightforward affair. Once you plug in a pair of headphones (to act as an antenna), the app will scan the stations available in your region. You can also input the region manually if the app doesn't configure it correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is RDS support, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is adequate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto E pulled in an adequate, if uninspiring performance in our audio quality test. The smartphone was averagely loud and demonstrated good dynamic range, low noise levels and decent distortion levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response and the stereo crosstalk with headphones left something to be desired, though, so we won't be recommending this one to any hardcore audiophiles. Considering its price range, though, we'd say the results are about right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor fixed focus 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto E comes with a modest 5MP fixed-focus camera. It takes images in a maximum resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. It lacks auto focus but it has a built-in HDR mode, which can even be set to activate automatically in certain shooting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does have the same minimalist interface as on the Moto X and G, which includes just two on screen buttons on the right-hand side for video recording and front-facing camera. Taking an image is done simply by tapping the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available advanced settings include HDR, touch focus , panorama, geo-tagging, widescreen mode, and shutter sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't much to talk about the produced images. The resolved detail is low, the contrast seems a bit down too, while the colors and the white balance are OK at best. Macro shots are, of course, a no-go, as there is no auto-focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning on HDR does a better job of extending the dynamic range, but the quality remains as poor as that of the standard shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Auto-HDR is a bit unreliable so we'd recommend manually choosing whichever mode you prefer so as to get more consistent results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto E enters our Photo quality comparison tool to face off against other 5MP shooters. You can also pit it against other cameras from within the tools' page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The Motorola Moto E in our photo compare test</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FWVGA video recording at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder UI is the same as the camera one, with the top right button being used to toggle video recording. The Moto E records FWVGA (864 x 480) videos at a constant 30fps. The bitrate is a meager 8Mbps, which can partly explain the poor resolved detail. Audio is recorded at 128 Kbps in stereo mode with a sampling rate of 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos on the Moto E are far from stellar, with the low level of detail being the most noticeable issue. There are similar problems with poor dynamic range like on the still camera, and the contrast is still on the low side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a short video sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come two untouched WVGA video samples taken straight from the Motorola Moto E.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video sample 2</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto E comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the available settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups. Reduce data usage does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and diary (agenda). Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto E also features the Quick Office, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator and Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer) are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has implemented its own version of a Do Not Disturb feature via their Assist app. It will keep the Moto E quiet while you're in a meeting or sleeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the sleeping option lets you configure the time interval, allow calls from a favorite contact or list of contacts and put through calls from the same person if they call twice in the interval of 5 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola provides two more Moto exclusive apps - Motorola Alert and Moto Migrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Migrate app will help you transfer contacts, messages and multimedia from other Android devices or iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alert app allows you to select your emergency contacts, input ready-to-go messages and in case something happens you can call your contacts, send them messages with GPS coordinates, or ask them to follow you. The latter will make your Moto E send your GPS coordinates at specified interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and its more thumbable Navigation counterpart are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS/GLONASS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are most useful when you use them while you are online. Google Maps allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection but you can't search for addresses or POIs without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. It can also display pretty accurate traffic alerts as well (though it doesn't always take them into account when routing you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool, which is available to all Android devices, is the Android Device Manager. It's keeps you connected to all Android devices, on which you've setup your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced device by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it gets stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data. What few people seem to realize is that for the remote locking to work, you have to initially enable it on your smartphone via the pre-installed Google Settings app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When picking our next phone for review, we relatively get down so low on the food chain as we got with the Motorola Moto E. But given Motorola's track record of disrupting the industry, we figured this one deserves a through look. Compared to most of the other smartphones that come our way, it really doesn't have much fighting chance, but we approached this review completely understanding this sort of pricing is almost bottom of the barrel. We expected to be disappointed but we are also curious to see whether Motorola has done it again - much like they did with the highly successful Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy that the Moto E delivered successfully in so many departments. At around ?100 it's unlikely that you would find a smartphone with a 4.3-inch screen with an ambient light sensor and Gorilla Glass 3 protection. You also get the latest Android release and performance of the Snapdragon 200 was quite acceptable. The loudspeaker was one of the loudest we've tested - a rarity among smartphones these days. Battery life was quite good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this sort of setting, it was clear something had to give. And in the case of the Moto E, that's the camera, which is subpar in almost every respect. There are more expensive smartphones out there where front facing cameras make better photos than the one taken by the Moto E's camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto E key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's now clear. Following in the steps of the successful Moto G, the Moto E successfully brings pure Android experience on modest but sufficient hardware. With official pricing of ?89 or about ?110 Moto E is a bargain offer you'll have a hard time not taking if you are in the market for an entry level smartphone. You can even opt for a dual-SIM flavor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is little competition in the super low-end smartphone segment, at least not as adequate as the Moto E. We are going to explore a few reasonable offers we were able to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android-based Nokia X lineup turned out successful in the developing markets and even though the 4" Nokia X, Nokia X+ and the 5" Nokia XL are less powerful than Moto E and lack any Google service integration, they've managed to sell well. Unfortunately, these "low-cost" options cost as much as the Moto E and the limited app catalog isn't helping their case at all.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Z4 costs as much as a Moto E too, packs a 4" WVGA display and a dual-core processor. It is dual SIM-enabled, but has half the RAM the Moto E comes with, which will surely affect the overall performance of the Android Jelly Bean OS.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Of course, the best-selling Windows Phone handset ever - Nokia Lumia 520 - will be sticking for a while as a great budget offer. The 4-inch Lumia 520 will be soon refreshed with the latest Windows Phone 8.1 OS, plus its camera offers auto-focus and better 720p video recording. If you don't mind the somewhat limited Windows Phone application store and the lack of proper background capabilities for apps such as Viber, you should definitely check it out. There is also the Lumia 525 that doubles the RAM for even better performance, too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC Desire 310 and LG L70 both come with 4.5" displays and optional dual-SIM capabilities. The Desire 310 is a quad-core device with 5MP fixed-focus camera and Android Jelly Bean, while the LG L70 runs on the same Snapdragon 200 chipset ticking inside the Moto E, but comes with a 5MP AF cam, IPS display and Android KitKat in charge. You can have either of those at about ?30 above the Moto E and we're not sure the price premium is worth it unless you are into the bigger screen.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you'd like to stretch a bit, an extra ?40 would get you the Moto G or an extra ?50 would even secure you the Moto G 4G, which has a microSD slot. Either of those upgrades the display to HD, adds two additional CPU cores and comes with very capable camera with great image quality. Naturally, both have been treated with Android KitKat already.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Well, we've come to the end of this review and we are happy to report that the Moto E is another bulls-eye by Motorola. It's not the best performer out there, but it packs a serious punch for the least amount of money. We especially appreciated the unspoiled Android OS and the solid promise for timely updates. The camera is certainly a letdown, but not everybody needs a good camera. What everybody would get with the Moto E is a solid user experience and great bang-for-buck ratio, and that's what counts.</paragraph>
