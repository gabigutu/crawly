			<paragraph>The LG KF700 (codenamed Virgo) is among the latest LG full touch handsets. Besides being one of the most affordable one among those, it stands out with multiple control-and-navigation methods. LG KF700 puts together a 3" touchscreen display, a slide-out standard keypad and a side mounted scroll wheel with an adjacent OK key. The neat and solid KF700 blends together elegance and great web surfing to broaden its appeal beyond the fashion-savvy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 3.5G aboard a sharp and nifty touch UI, we waste no time to fire it up and see it perform. Stay with us for more of LG KF700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 was announced back in February 2008 and this review is not our first encounter with it - you may remember we did a quick and dirty preview of a pre-release sample back in May. Now that we have a retail KF700 unit, we decided to upgrade our preview to a full-featured review, covering all the ins and outs of this affordable touch phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 has a remarkably responsive user interface, fashionable looks and strives to deliver most of the multimedia applications you might want in a mobile phone. The three input methods are diverse enough for you to find your preference. However, all the three types are rather fused - the only one you could go without is the scroll wheel. The touchscreen display does the job for most tasks, but you need the keypad to enter text. The keypad is useless on its own too, because it has no D-pad. So in the end, you are bound to use at least two of the input methods described.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Combining all three navigation modes more or less puts the KF700 in a class of its own, but you may still find a few alternatives worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 is currently selling at about 230 euro (or 340 US dollars), which basically is a really competitive price - you would be hard pressed to find a sleek touch phone for less, unless of course you go for an at least year-old UIQ or Windows Mobile device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, for a little extra cash (about 50 euro or 75 US dollars more) you will have a much wider choice with some excellent contenders for your money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG Viewty and the Samsung F480 Tocco are some great devices that deserve your attention. Just in case you really need that hardware keypad, you might also consider the LG KF750 Secret, which offers some touchscreen functionality too - not throughout the whole interface but it covers all the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That LG KF700 was thrown directly against Samsung F700 is a tempting assumption to make (how about model designation too). Take the QWERTY away and you got two handsets that are as good as twins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ok, there must be a bunch of WinMo phones out there too, but LG KF700 doesn't seem willing to compete with smartphones. Anyway, let's waste no more time and see what the LG KF700 has in store for us. Take the jump for more on construction and ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the LG KF700<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 comes in a really nice retail box, much in the line of the original Black Label series and LG Chocolate. Each piece of the package contents has its own little box. You'll find a charger, USB data cable, a headset with a remote that has a 3.5mm audio jack on it, and finally a screen protector.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KF700 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 is a medium-sized handset measuring 102 x 51 x 14.5 mm and weighing 110 g. It's not slim by any standards but still manages a nice fit in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 is a nicely looking device - its slender oblong shape is not something you see everyday. At 110 g the KF700 is definitely not the lightest of handsets. But the overall feeling you get is of one compact little gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display follows the same ratio as the body itself (1:2) and has a diagonal of 3 inches. Its resolution is 240 x 480 pixels (that's Wide QVGA res), which isn't too common. Custom-made wallpapers will be your only option if you have your eyes set on this slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of sliding, that's exactly what you have to do to reveal the hidden keypad. The keys are styled in different shades of grey and form the signature LG pattern well known since the original LG Chocolate. The keys are large, oblong and with nice press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the device houses the proprietary LG connectivity port - this is where you plug your headset, charger and USB cable. On this side you also get the camera key and the touchscreen lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side holds almost no controls except for the special scroll wheel/OK key combo. The scroll wheel lets you flip through menus while the OK key is used for confirming the selection. Pressing the OK key in standby mode or in the main menu will bring up a special customizable shortcut menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metallic scroll wheel offers smooth action, and the OK key is tactile enough and solid to press. A certain disadvantage - at least to us - is the fact that you can't press the scroll wheel itself to make an action. We are used to that solution with its frequent implementations in numerous smartphones and PocketPC by various manufacturers. But it may be just our crabby selves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the LG KF700 features no controls whatsoever. The top one though has accommodated the microSD memory card slot. The card is hot-swappable and that's the way it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can confirm that the LG KF700 doesn't have issues handling 8GB microSD cards. The card is instantly available to the user with no initial scanning needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the LG KF700 features the 3 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. Next to it is the metallic scroll wheel. Regardless of its questionable usability, the scroll wheel is quite a nice accent to boost the rear view of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the LGIP-570A 900 mAh Li-Ion battery - the manufacturer promises up to 280 h of standby time in a 3G network and up to 3 h of talk time. In reality, the LG KF700 manages good three days of operation with a single charge - used rather sparingly of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Held in hand the KF700 might not look the smallest chap around, but you gotta believe us when we say it's really compact - especially whth the keypad slid in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of both the KF700 keypad and the display is good. However LG displays still suffer under direct sunlight - especially with fingerprint smudges all over its face.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flashy user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of LG KF700 is Flash-based, much like the one in LG Viewty. There are a number of novelties but the KF700 is positioned just below the Viewty in the LG portfolio, so it's natural to have some features missing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the new stuff. Firstly, there is a new centralized menu for managing profiles, music player and Bluetooth connectivity. It also displays the memory status. To access it, you just need to press the upper part of the screen in standby or in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, there is new handling of desktop widgets - all of them are hidden onto a sliding pane to the right. You can easily choose which one of them to show on the desktop by sliding out the pane. When you are done you just tuck it away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there is a new navigation row of icons, which is available across all submenus. The icons are shortcuts to applications such as the task manager, phonebook, messaging and homescreen. The task manager is really nice and it even allows you to run several applications simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the scroll wheel - the new navigation solution on the side of the handset - brings along its own customizable dial-shaped shortcut menu. However, since the scroll wheel is two-directional only (you can't press it) - you have to start the menu manually pressing the adjacent OK key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scroll wheel can be used throughout the whole menu system, however you can't select items in the main menu using the scroll wheel/OK key combo. The scroll wheel allows you to scroll through the tabs of the main menu or in the submenus. Last time we checked, the scroll wheel flipped through one item at a time and you had to scroll like hell to go faster. We are happy that LG have sorted that out in the retail unit and a full rotation of the scroll wheel jumps several items with a single scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the same old navigation bar with shortcuts sits at the bottom of the screen - just as in the Viewty. The four available shortcuts are not user configurable. The first shortcut takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contacts list, the third one opens the Messaging submenu, and the last one takes you to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside all that, the user interface of the LG KF700 retains the same menu system as the LG Viewty - simple, yet impressively sophisticated. LG have made a really nice job designing the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since built-in accelerometers are all the rage now and there are many handsets that have those already - we find the lack of one (and hence no screen auto rotation) a bit of a letdown. We shouldn't forget though that the LG KF700 was probably developed last year, so it's only natural it wasn't caught up in the accelerometer fad in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of four tabs - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. They don't have names but the first one is related to making calls and sending messages. The second one is the entertainment package, which houses the multimedia files, the camera, the FM radio, the games, and the music player. The third submenu includes tools such as the web browser, the Google package, organizer applications such as the Calendar, the Calculator, the Unit converter, etc. And finally, the fourth item handles all the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the user interface comes in the black and white theme, well-known ever since the LG Prada phone. Beside that default one, the LG KF700 has another color theme as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An absolute must-have for every full touch-based handset, and a feature we miss in the Apple iPhone (both versions), is some sort of feedback when the screen is pressed - something besides the touch tone and the touch animation. LG KF700 comes with vibration feedback, which means that every press is accompanied by a gentle vibration, that let's you know your press has been accepted. Settings for it include a choice of three types of vibration plus 7 levels of vibration strength.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the LG Viewty however, there is no on-screen QWERTY keyboard, and there is no handwriting recognition either. You now have a sliding hardware keypad always at hand.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is the usual good quality stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG KF700 is up to 1000 contacts (unlike the Viewty and its capacity of 500). The phonebook allows storing extensive information on you contacts. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contacts list actually jumps from letter to letter and allows you to search your contacts alphabetically. You can always use the keypad and search for your contacts via the search box. Search is performed by gradual typing of a contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, a good thing is that you can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 deals great with making phone calls, as you have all the rights to expect. The phone dialer is the only place where you have an on-screen numeric keypad for you to enter stuff. In all other cases you will have to use the hardware keypad. Anyways, in either scenario there is no Smart Dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any LG handset - the green receiver key takes you to the list of all calls, while you can access the full Call Log from the main menu. Beside your calls register, it also offers a web data counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to loudspeaker volume, it's no news that the KF700 is one good performer. Here is how the LG KF700 stacks alongside some other handsets we've tested recently. More info on our test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is intuitive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. Much like the Viewty, SMS and MMS share one and the same editor. There is no virtual keypad here (or handwriting recognition), so you will have to slide out the hardware keypad to type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the numeric Call dial pad is the only place where you have an on-screen keypad - for all other purposes you should rely on the hardware one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG KF700 deals with them with no hassle whatsoever. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. The maximum attachment size for incoming mail is 300KB. You can set the handset to auto retrieve your new emails at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The KF700 native client doesn't support SSL, so you can't setup a Gmail account to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to use Gmail, you will either have to access it online via the browser, or use their Java application, which is already available for LG KF700 (but not pre-installed).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Superb multimedia performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 comes with a good 176MB of internal memory (the Viewty had only 100MB) and of course there is a microSD memory card slot. Again, unlike the Viewty, the memory card slot is on the top of the device so hot-swapping cards is an option. We can also confirm that 8GB microSD cards worked on our retail unit. However, we did notice a huge lag in file browsing (even in the handset memory), once the memory card started to fill up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KF700 file manager appears as the My stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. The KF700 had no problem here reading custom folders off the memory card as some other LG phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main functionality of the image gallery remains the same as the one of the Viewty. Browsing images is even faster here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a second image gallery accessible only from the camera interface. It's really nice looking and involves much more touch in image browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 offers the same MP3 player as the Viewty. You can filter tracks as with any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, playlist, recently played and few more. The handset itself has a Flight mode, which really makes it an adequate solution as a portable music player. There are still no equalizer settings for you to use to enhance the player sound. The music player skin now changes to match the currently selected interface theme - in the Viewty it always stayed black.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 turned out quite a gifted musician in our test. Well, we can't overlook the disastrous stereo crosstalk reading. In fact, we cannot think of any other handset to score worse in this area. However, the rest of the numbers are excellent with good dynamic range and noise levels, and distortion well under control. The frequency response is also on the better side of the handsets we've tested. Have in mind that the published readings are only achievable when the volume level is two steps below the maximum. If you go higher than that the audio quality severely suffers due to distortion. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KF700 vs LG KU990 Viewty frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player runs in the background problem-free. The same goes for the FM radio, too. As opposed to the Viewty you can now listen to the radio on the handset loudspeaker - that's a basic feature but it was missing in the LG Viewty. The radio stores up to 24 stations - double the amount available in the LG Viewty. However the radio misses the RDS functionality found in the Viewty - you can only enter a radio station ID manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in LG KF700 is much like the one seen in the Viewty - it is really nice and you can watch videos in fullscreen landscape mode, with or without semi-transparent overlay of player controls. You can also opt for both normal and widescreen aspect ratio. Unfortunately, the DivX playback support has been dropped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>YouTube integration is also nowhere founding sight, which is a bummer as you need to rely on the web browser for that purpose and it lacks flash support. So when it comes to YouTube videos, your only option seems the mobile-phone-optimized version of the website found at http://m.youtube.com, which streams the videos in poor quality 3GP format.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera : medium performer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 packs a 3 megapixel autofocus camera and doesn't strive to be a dedicated cameraphone, so we didn't expect wonders at the very start. The maximum image resolution is 2048 x 1536 pixels. The camera is equipped with a regular LED flash, nothing impressive really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to the unusual display ratio (1:2), the camera uses only the center of the display as a viewfinder. If you set its viewfinder mode to fullscreen, it crops the visible image and you don't get to see the whole composition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short press on the dedicated camera key starts the still image camera, while a press-and-hold activates the camcorder. It's not that convenient a solution - as you can frequently start the camera by accident (all it takes is a short press).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has only run-of-the-mill settings - nothing fancy here. There are no preset scenes or special shooting modes such as panorama. You can shoot in burst and you can use frames to spice up your portrait images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are white balance presets (a useful feature when shooting indoors where most cameras fail to strike the right balance) and color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, sketch, solarize, emboss)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also manually adjust the ISO sensitivity (100-800). The LED flash is easy to control too and you can set it to permanently on to use it as video light. Unfortunately, in our unit the shutter sound couldn't be muted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG KF700 is a medium performer in terms of image quality, which is an upgrade from what we last saw when previewing a pre-release unit. The color balance is still unreliable but the level of resolved detail is relatively good. On most photos even foliage turns out pretty well and that is a hard task for every mobile phone. On the negative side the contrast of the photos is way too low and they look rather washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some sample photos from the LG KF700 camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings for the camcorder are pretty similar to those of the still image camera. The maximum video resolution is QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) at 15 fps. Videos are recorded in 3GP format only. All of that was enough to disappoint us - obviously video recording on the KF700 is meant for MMS purposes only. That's why we are not even making the effort to publish a video sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is in the fast lane, save for Bluetooth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 features tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support plus HSDPA 7.2Mbps. Bluetooth 1.2 is also a connectivity option with A2DP support for streaming music to a stereo Bluetooth headset. Bluetooth 1.2 is OK for audio streaming, but sending files on Bluetooth 2.0 (especially with EDR) is way faster. The latest Bluetooth version has been around long enough, which makes us wonder why LG resorted to v1.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB Mass Storage support is also on board. Much like the Viewty, when you connect the KF700 to a PC you only have the memory card appearing, and the internal memory is not accessible. In order to access it, you'll need to install the proprietary LG PC Suite that's also used for syncing your handset with a PC.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fluid web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 has a nice web browser - it has the same features as the LG Viewty but with even better implementation. Turning the screen to landscape mode makes browsing even more enjoyable. There is even a mini-map to help you find your way around elaborate web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can browse web pages with or without the controls visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs (manageable by a shortcut) and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also save images by simply holding your thumb over an image. You can also use the scroll wheel on the back to seamlessly zoom in and out on web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several rendering modes - the desktop one is true to the original, the screen optimized one fits all the page content into one long column, while our personal favorite - the text wrap mode keeps the page layout in tact but wraps and dynamically resizes text in order to comfortably fit your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once a page has loaded, you can change rendering modes and screen orientation on the fly with no noticeable lags whatsoever, Scrolling is fast enough and you can drag pages around with your finger much like you would on an iPhone. What's more, the panning feels as natural and fluid as on the iPhone. It definitely manages to surpass what Samsung offers in their full touch handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Heavy duty organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, it offers a monthly and a weekly view, and you can navigate the dates with your finger. A large orange square denotes the current date. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger. Just as the Viewty, you can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default. You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding an event is made really simple. You can have up to 100 calendar events. There's a separate TO-DO application and it can also store up to 100 tasks. There is a Memo feature that allows storing some notes. Unfortunately, you can store as little as 5 of them. Another organizing app is the Date Finder - simple stuff like"Let's see what date will it be five days from now!"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 available alarm slots. The LG KF700 also has a Calculator, a Unit converter and Voice recorder. Once you record a voice note, you can send it via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's some other stuff, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 also offers office document viewing courtesy of the Picsel viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF files. Much like on the LG Viewty, scrolling and zooming in documents is really fast. It's only on PDF and PPT files that you notice certain lags. Scrolling and panning documents is as natural and fluid as browsing web pages in the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even view your documents in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Google package also boosts web experience for the KF700 user. Much like the LG Viewty, it offers shortcuts to Google Search, Gmail, Blogger and the mobile version of YouTube. From here you can also open the Google Maps app that comes pre-installed on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also easily download the Java-based Gmail application, which gives you a better, more optimized experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming is thumb friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 comes with a touch optimized game called Thomsons &amp; Touch - the same as the one found on the LG KF600. It's actually a set of four mini-games involving different characters of the Thomson family. Although somewhat childish and oversimplified, we enjoyed playing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are free to install other games of your choice without worrying about the unconventional resolution - titles for QVGA screens run just as fine on the KF700, taking only the upper two thirds of the screen. The unused space is thus available to display virtual controls that should make up for the lack of a D-pad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 is a good all-rounder with nice performance in almost all aspects - it's got nice design (although not that thin), rich connectivity package (the lack of Wi-Fi and GPS is alright in a feature phone) and responsive touch-based interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the camera image quality is not that good and video recording has a "MMS-only" sign all over, the KF700 sports nice multimedia features and has an excellent touch-optimized web browser (save for the flash support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, it's a difficult time for touch phones - firstly, there are new ones coming out with increasingly advanced features, then there's the iPhone 3G rolling out to a quite a large part of the world, and finally there are several other handsets on the market that cost slightly more but offer tons of more features. So obviously, if affordability is key and you're after a sleek and easy to use touch handset, LG KF700 is a really nice choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have set a firm foot on the touch phone market and they seem to be pushing more and more touchscreens. The LG KF700 is obviously not a high-end device and it has an attractive price point (at the time of writing) at around 230 euro (340 US dollars). We feel comparison with LG KC550 is quite justified. The affordable 5 megapixel snapper is a focused little gadget that brought the Viewty and Secret flair down to the masses. LG KF700 might be more of a niche product, but what it does is pretty similar. It takes a nice and capable touch platform, follows some Prada dress code and puts it all to use with HSDPA and nice browsing at a reasonable price.</paragraph>
