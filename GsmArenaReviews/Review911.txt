			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lightweight, agile and simply affordable, seven-inchers did, at one point, seem capable of pushing ten-inch Android tablets out of business. Even Samsung, with its device-for-every-taste approach had to admit defeat. The Koreans all but threw in the towel with the Galaxy Tab line, consciously relegating it to the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes are a different breed though - one we can't see Samsung giving up on any time soon. Of course, it's always the phablet enjoying most of the spotlight and the Note 3 has already had several occasions to emphatically prove that it deserved every bit of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the ten-point-one that follows closely could turn out to be the even more impressive device in terms of the scope and depth of upgrades it brings to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes in three different flavors sharing a quite similar design to the Galaxy Note 3 phablet. There is a Wi-Fi-only version and a 3G-enabled model, both powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 Octa chipset, as well as an LTE-capable tablet with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 800 chipset ticking inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one we're reviewing is the Exynos 5 version and here goes the spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest in processing power is not a bragging right - more a necessity really - considering there are more than a handful of potential competitors powered by either Snapdragon 800 or Tegra 4. And not Androids only, the likes of the Lumia 2520 and the Surface too. The iPad Air certainly doesn't come underpowered either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the choice of chipset(s) isn't the only lesson learned from the previous Note 10.1. This time around, the screen resolution too is at the top of what's currently available in the tablet segment. Samsung have also thrown in a massive 8220mAh battery in a body that's more compact, slimmer and weighing less than the predecessor's. The 2014 Edition Note 10.1 couldn't have hoped for a better start and the praise the Note 3 is getting will put even more wind in its sails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But is it going in the right direction and what kind of journey will it be? Follow us on the next page where we begin to find out, starting as usual with the design and build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition takes after this year's flagship phablet and isn't keen on experimenting. The tablet is a scaled-up near replica of the Note 3, featuring the same faux-leather-like finish at the rear. It is offered in the same black and white paint jobs as the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 243.1 x 171.4 x 7.9 mm, the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is near 2cm narrower and a millimeter slimmer than the predecessor while offering the same screen real estate and a more robust battery. The Wi-Fi-only version weighs 540g, which is 60g less than the original Note 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen bezels are notably slimmer, which is probably the main reason for the relocation of the stereo speakers to the sides (in landscape position). We liked the front-facing speakers on the original better, but their position on the 2014 edition is sufficiently high to not get covered by hands holding the device and are quite loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 insists on having the hardware controls at the front. Beneath the display we find the usual combo of a hardware Home button between capacitive Menu and Back keys. We don't think this is the best solution as those get in the way once you start using the tablet in portrait mode. Those occasions are rather rare but once you decide to use it that way, accidental taps on the Back key are likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top (in landscape) we find an IR blaster, the Power/Lock button and the slim volume rocker next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone is at the bottom, which is something to consider if you're going to make Skype or Viber calls in loudspeaker mode (the mic can get muffled depending on where you place the tablet). That, by the way, applies to calls over the cellular network too, which the other versions are perfectly capable of. Our unit though is the Wi-Fi-only version with no GSM, 3G or LTE radios on board. A standard microUSB port is also around and used for charging . We are happy to see Samsung has dropped the proprietary 30-pin connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition has the 3.5mm audio jack and one of the stereo speakers, under a subtle metallic grille. On the right we find the S-Pen compartment, the other speaker and the microSD slot, covered by a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is the same that comes with the Galaxy Note 3 phablet. It can now be used on the capacitive buttons too, so you can navigate the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 with the stylus only. The new S Pen enables several great shortcuts, so using the stylus might actually be faster for certain tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen can be placed back into its compartment either side up, the button facing up or down. The stylus is made of matte plastic, with a finely grooved top part that matches the sides of the Note 10.1. The flat sides of the stylus actually allow an even more comfortable grip. The button is positioned on one of those flat sides and is easy to reach. We found it a bit unusual that the S Pen compartment is actually in the tablet's long side but it's quite comfortable - for right-handed users obviously, being in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 we find an upgraded 8MP camera with an LED flash next to it. The camera is quite capable of shooting the occasional photos and 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet has lost a bit of weight, which can definitely be felt, and is more space-efficient. The bezels have been trimmed down as well. Edges appear sharper on the latest Note 10.1 and, coupled with the slimmer body and feel of leather, lend a more conservative, businesslike quality to the package as a whole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 can be held with one hand and operated with the other, but at about half a kilo you will soon need to find some kind of support. The build is excellent though, and the leather-like rear not only adds a touch of sophistication but also nicely enhances the grip. We had fears the finish wouldn't works as well on a bigger scale, but the ten-inch Note looks and feels great.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 10.1" Super Clear LCD now has four times the resolution of the original Galaxy Note 10.1 at 2560 x 1600 pixels. This adds up to 299ppi, which is the highest available on a tablet at this screen size. In fact, the iPad's Retina has long been outstripped by no other than Samsung themselves with the Nexus 10. The screen of the latter could actually have been used on the 2014 Edition Note 10.1, but Samsung claim they're different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung lets you select between four display modes for your Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 - adaptive, dynamic, normal and movie. Naturally, those that are fond of the extra punchy colors should opt for the dynamic setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers aside, the image quality is excellent. Viewing angles are very good and blacks look reasonably deep. The outdoor visibility has been greatly improved too. We ran our usual display tests on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 and here are the results:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is powered by a massive 8220 mAh Li-Po battery. By Samsung's estimates, it should give you 2230 hours of standby and 98 hours of music playback. We did our own tests too, and the tablet managed 9 hours of video playback and 7 hours and 39 minutes of web browsing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.3 Jelly Bean and TouchWiz UI is all you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition runs on the latest available Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS upgraded with lots of premium features courtesy of Samsung's own TouchWiz UI. Samsung has done plenty of work optimizing the interface for the larger screen, bringing split-screen interfaces to the settings menu and virtually all system apps. The widgets have been polished too and have been made to support both portrait and landscape mode, while the shortcuts at the bottom of the screen are gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get started, here's a short video of the UI in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which features multiple widgets (one widget per a pane) introduced with Android 4.2.2 that we saw on the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3. The default lockscreen shows the time on a beautiful background. You can choose what effect to add to the unlocking. The options include ripple and watercolor, which blur the color on screen as if you were dragging a wet paint brush through the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the lockscreen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts. You can opt for a greeting personalized message as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is one of the few UI elements that fails to capitalize on the large screen. Instead of only covering a part of the screen and letting you see what's underneath, it stretches over the complete 10 inches. At the top there are eleven (or seven in portrait mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than eleven toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the other five. Or you can tap the expand button, which reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 16 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can remove this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Reply" on a missed email notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same if you're coming from a Galaxy S4, Note 3 or Note 8.0. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub and Action Memo, and the vast majority of those are adjusted to work both horizontally and vertically. Since this is a much larger screen, you also get a far bigger grid to fill with widgets - 8 by 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's new on the homescreen is the dedicated Google Search widget docked at the bottom left corner. It is visible on every homescreen pane, just like the app drawer shortcut at the bottom right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode with all homescreen panes visible simultaneously. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed too much since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable or alphabetized grid and you can view only those apps you've downloaded yourself . You can also disable some of the pre-installed apps so they won't take any RAM or appear in the app drawer, but not all apps can be hidden this way. Strangely the hide shortcuts feature has gone missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a tiny map of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can see how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes with Multi-window (running two apps side by side) which now even allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two web browser windows next to each other. There is also dedicated shortcut that lets you switch the places of the two opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff from one of the opened apps to the other is now available and is done in just three taps. It's a definite improvement and something the multi-window feature needed badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the way. It's a feature that will be used really often, especially on a slate, and we are happy to see Samsung extending its support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, Device, Controls and General and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the Device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are on your default homescreen pane, a tap on the Home key will bring you to the Flipboard-like Samsung News full-screen app. It aggregates articles from a pre-defined set of sources - it supports popular topics such as sports, movies, food, music, games, science, etc. plus top picks of your social network accounts and S-App personal content. The feature premiered with the Galaxy Note 3 and reminds us a lot of the HTC's Blinkfeed. It looks cooler than the Blinkfeed, but you can't add your own topics as you can do with the latest version of the Blinkfeed in Sense 5.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has used the latest iteration of TouchWiz to turn the Note 10.1 into a top-notch productivity tool. We really like the new Multi-window implementation, which makes multitasking faster and more convenient than it ever was on a tablet. It's also usually impressively responsive, thanks to the superb hardware inside. We did experience lag on a few occasions though, which is probably a result of some bugs that Samsung needs to squash as soon as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we are not fond of is the notification area. It just doesn't look right on the massive screen and resolution. We feel like Samsung should have done better designing this part of the UI because now it looks like a huge waste of available space. Is it useful and user-friendly - yes, but it still looks like a lazy porting job from the smartphone UI to the tablet one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Pen, Motion gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the new S-Pen features. You'll find pretty much every S-Pen-enabled app that premiered with the Notes e pre-installed on the Note 10.1 2014 Edition. Once you pull the S-Pen out, the new Air Command menu pops up. The new menu is available everywhere throughout the UI too, you just need to press the side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition works impressively fast and accurately - it handles just about everything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to... well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 10.1 with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It lets you launch a mini window with one of the supported apps by drawing a rectangle on the screen. The Galaxy Note 3 will then fit the floating app in said rectangle (correcting the aspect, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note is an application that allows you to create and customize notebooks. There is a total of 9 preset notebooks to choose from but you can also create your own custom look from images in your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you're done creating a notebook you can go ahead and fill it with notes, drawings, images on which you can draw or doodle, etc. The app gives you a nice little preview of the notes inside a notebook when you swipe it down in the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside a note you can choose from a variety of pens and brushes, adjust the color and thickness of the line, insert text in a number of fonts, make the text bold or italic, etc. You can create custom shapes, have an undo and redo option and choose to delete whole lines or just parts of the content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can insert just about anything into a note - voice memos, images, video, charts or illustrations, maps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook lets you keep any content you browse through on the Note 3's screen. You need to select anything on the screen of the Note 3 by pressing the S Pen button and the software highlights it and gives you a prompt to send it to Scrapbook via an image. Air Command also gives you a shortcut to Scrapbook and lets you highlight anything on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add notes to a scrapped image as well as tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you import images from your phone or SD card storage and sync with your Samsung account but to our disappointment won't let you sync your scraps and tags to Evernote, Springpad, Google Keep, or any other third party app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes with a number of other advanced features enabled by the powerful hardware and dedicated sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. Just like before when you're hovering the S Pen or finger over text or image, email, the software responds and brings you a larger pop up version of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is called information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on). It also works for previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, and it lets you checking out the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (available with the previous button too). There's also the use for for previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects only the S Pen (fingers are not supported) around 3cm away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is yet another feature that leverages on the front-facing camera - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get used to it initially, but once you do it's rather useful for certain scenarios - particularly when your other hand is busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final Samsung-exclusive feature is dubbed Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a basic set of motion gestures as well - you can zoom, move stuff or browse images by tilting or panning the device. You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own dedicated widget for the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice is also present on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. S Voice can be used to dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual tablet and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Note 10.1 to snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The only problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is available in two different versions - a Snapdragon 800-powered LTE model and a Samsung Exynos 5 Octa-running Wi-Fi and 3G editions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have the Wi-Fi-only model of the Galaxy Note 10.1 at our disposal, so we'll be running our benchmark routine over the latest Samsung Exynos 5420 chipset. It uses ARM's big.LITTLE architectures and has a four 1.5GHz Cortex-A15 cores and a four 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 cores on its processor. The slate can't use both sets of cores simultaneously, instead it utilizes the power-saving Cortex-A7 for lighter tasks and runs on the Cortex-A15 when reporting for heavier duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has announced it is possible to unlock the capability to use all eight cores simultaneously via a firmware update, but there is a risk of huge power drainage or overheating, so there is very little chance the Note 10.1 will be getting this update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first benchmark tests single-core performance. The Cortex-A15 core proved to be a worthy competitor for the 2.3GHz clocked Krait 400 CPUs, but still came second best.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core Linpack trial saw the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition post another score very close to those of the Snapdragon 800 rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is a very popular CPU and memory benchmark, where the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 beats every other device we've tested bar for its Galaxy Note 3 stablemate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant gauges the overall device performance and the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition came some way behind the best devices we have tested. Of course the higher resolution has certainly took its toll here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the pixel rich display didn't prevent the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition from topping the AnTuTu 4 scoreboard, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we put the Mali-T628MP6 GPU through the GFX Benchmark. It did as we expected - excellent and very close to the top of both tests. However, the Adreno 330 inside the Galaxy Note 3 managed to beat it on both occasions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the Epic Citadel benchmark, which runs on the screen and factors in the higher resolution. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 scored significantly lower than the top smartphones here, although it still produced playable framerates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as we expected the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 slate posted an impressive score in the JavaScropt SunSpider benchmark. It even managed to top the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 despite the two sharing their JavaScript enging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition beat every device we've put through the BrowserMark 2 test bar the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally comes Vellamo and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition rounded up an overall impressive performance, even if it again come a bit short of the top Snapdragon 800 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is certainly a powerhouse, posting solid scores all over the field. The good news is that more often than not this translates to flawless real-life performance and instant app loading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, on a few occasions we did notice some lag, which suggests that the firmware still has a few bugs that need to be addressed. There were no traces of it on the Galaxy Note 3, so we assume it has something to do with the tablet optimization of the TouchWiz UI.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Contacts app is pretty much the same as we left it on the previous generation Galaxy Note 10.1 - it uses split-screen view and has three tabs - Groups, Favorites and the default Contacts tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since our Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition doesn't support SIM cards, there is no Dialer or Messages app. If you tap on a number in the phonebook you will automatically redirected to the Skype app unless you've assigned a different one such as Viber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact management is fairly straightforward on the Galaxy Note 10.1. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this and you can also let the Galaxy Note 10.1 sync your social network contacts if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field in the top left corner, as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one at the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options: edit contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print namecards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done in a popup window, where the available fields are displayed, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn't existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren't available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Email and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition comes with two familiar email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic one to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single message, the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule automatic email retrieval or you can disable it completely and only check your mail manually. There's also a handy setting for the client to only download attachments automatically over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's basically the same treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual Samsung QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now, this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won't notice any big difference when handling short emails. Samsung has added a fifth numeric row to the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have thrown in two additional keyboard layouts to try and suit everyone's taste. You can opt for the small floating keyboard and a split keyboard from the dedicated key too. Choosing the latter allows you to quickly thumb-type while holding the tablet without stretching your thumbs too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The easiest way of typing is probably the handwriting because of Samsung's great support of languages for the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's auto correction and auto capitalization available, and you can enable sounds on key presses. There's haptic feedback too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Gallery is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition has a new layout. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a Scalado-like spiral of images and video, which after a while might even get a bit nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail preview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar on the left with all the albums. This means you can change albums without going through the gallery homescreen every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a press and hold on a picture the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed a great deal - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Note 10.1 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC and Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album and Playlist criteria but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on many of the Galaxy Note 3 competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asks if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience. After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy Note 10.1 shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is as clean as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition did amazingly in the first part of audio output test. It wasn't any louder than the Galaxy Note 3 (so about average in general terms) but it had no weak points to its performance whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet wasn't particularly bothered when we plugged in a pair of headphones and put in another great performance. The solitary affected reading was stereo crosstalk and even that remained great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While our Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 doesn't have telephony features, we still tested the loudspeaker performance as it will be used for music and videos. It scored a Very Good score and we can confirm the stereo speakers are indeed quite loud.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player lacks DivX video and AC3 audio support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has two tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is really highlights the power of the the quad-core beast - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome feature that shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, for the first time ever in a Galaxy flagship, the video player doesn't support DivX video and AC3 audio codecs. And while we can forgive the lack of DivX support since those videos are going to be extinct soon, we just can't live without the AC3 audio support. Most of the high-res videos out there use MKV containers with AC3 audio, which makes the video player useless for those. You'll have to opt for a third party app if you want to play such files. We really hope this to be an issue of our pre-production unit, otherwise it would be a shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse of your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video are move it around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera does an excellent job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An 8 megapixel main camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera (with 1080p videos each) is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. You'll be looking awkwardly taking photos or videos with a 10" slate, but if you want to use them for more than video-chats, you have the option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. A single viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The majority of the settings is located in the top left corner. Still, there a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy Note 1.1 is capable of naming photos with your location (the location needs to be turned on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the cooler settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter keys. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops he text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one is the arrow at the bottom of the screen, which brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the shooting modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic beauty touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p. Another way to capture moving objects is Cine Photo, which creates cinemagrams. The result is an animated GIF file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines if you're at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot. All the Galaxy Note 10.1 would send is the still image, a JPEG, and the sound remains on the phone. Shame that Samsung didn't use the standard Audio note feature of JPEG photos for this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important shooting mode that's not found in the carousel is double shot. It snaps a photo with both the front and the back cameras, so the person holding the phone can be in the shot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos shot with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 are excellent, a lot better than you'd expected from a tablet. The noise levels are low and there's plenty of detail, while the white balance. Colors are generally nice, too, although the green channel is boosted a bit too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 also features HDR mode, which does an excellent job of adding more detail in the highlights without going too far with the effect and producing unrealistic shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, just like the Galaxy Note 3, is capable of shooting 360-degree 60MP panorama shots with excellent detail and very few stitching artifacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p videos are pretty cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is capable of capturing 1080p videos. The Wi-Fi-only and 3G flavors record the 1080p videos at 30fps, while the LTE model is capable of 60fps video recording in addition to the standard 30fps video capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 stores videos in MP4 files with 17Mbps bitrate on average. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera doesn't have many fancy shooting modes like the still camera, but dual shot is available and you can do time lapse videos. The time lapse videos can speed things up to 8x, with resolution and frame rate remaining at 1080p @ 30fps (time lapse actually requires less processing power than regular video capture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 6MP (16:9) photos during recording as well, their image quality seems quite decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition have a good amount of resolved detail, steady frame rate and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images. The continuous autofocus triggers a bit too often, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a 1080p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3G-enabled Note 10.1 2014 Edition gets you quad-band GSM with 3G speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an LTE-capable model running on the Snapdragon 800 chipset. It also comes with quad-band GSM and 3G support with HSPDA up to 42Mbps. The LTE support covers six bands and is category 4, which means you get up to 150Mbps downlink and up to 50Mbps uplink speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three models of the Note 10.1 2014 are GPS-enabled with GLONASS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well, on top of the 16/32/64GB of internal storage. This means that getting some of the more expensive storage options is unnecessary as microSD cards are really cheap these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that. Using one you can connect card readers, USB flash drives and other compatible devices to your tablet and access their contents through the file manager. Mice and keyboards are supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy an HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable. There's no NFC connectivity or FM radio on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android tablet web browser hardly has changed, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition has the hardware specs to propel it to great heights of user experience. The huge, ultra sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Galaxy Note 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view, Smart scroll and Smart stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your S-Pen over a web element and it will act as if a mouse cursor was over it instead, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, including the Polaris Office with both viewing and editing documents enabled. It has a nice user interface and solid file management. It supports both internal and web storage (via Box.net, Dropbox, Google Drive or SugarSync).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing word documents, spreadsheets and Power Point files is hassle-free. There's a PDF reader in the bundle as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has six different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, list and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive. You can set multiple alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and use multiple Galaxy devices as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the devices communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy Note 10.1 becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's device and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there was a poker and puzzle games preloaded on our unit with Asphalt7 and Gun Bros offered as other games that support Group Play multiplayer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Vision on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 allows you to stack up several devices and get a bigger resulting screen area for your content. If your friends rock a Galaxy Note 10.1 you can team up and create a cool video watching experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Peel Smart Remote is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. First you will be ask to configure it to acts as remote on your TV and your set-top-box. Then the app asks about your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area, so it can double as a TV Guide.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hubs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone - Samsung, at least, seems to think so. And while before there used to be several different applications for the various Samsung Hubs, in the latest TouchWiz they're all accessible from one centralized Samsung Hub location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing you can see right off the bat when accessing the Hub is absence of any social networking features. Samsung has dropped Social Hub features found in TouchWiz versions of old, leaving you to traditional dedicated apps for your social networking fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the new Samsung Hub gives you access to stores for apps, games, and books. Each of the sections take you to the respective stores. The first app section will get you to Samsung Apps store. You can either buy digital magazines, books and online newspapers from the Book Store, browse and play either Social or Premium games in the Game Store. The latter features a try-before-you-buy option, as well as titles by Gameloft and EA, which are otherwise not available on the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation, where available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution already. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and 3rd party SatNav apps are in danger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now though, turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is available in lots of countries, but if you don't live in any of them, the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the Android apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps. From music / video players, to file managers and various tools, you'll always see something worth a try. The problem is those specifically optimized for tablets are only a fraction of all available apps. Some of the rest scale pretty well to the large screen, but some simply end up pixelated and downright poorly looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally included its own Apps store. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the disappointing first generation, for reasons varying from screen resolution to failing to launch on time, the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes to show that Samsung is a good learner. Four times the screen resolution and 299ppi are only part of the reason why this is the best tablet screen in the market right now. Well, the iPad mini 2 will be quick to disagree but it does come an inch or so short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design also took off in the right direction. Not only is the 2014 Edition Galaxy Note 10.1 far prettier than its predecessor, it's also notably smaller and lighter. The slimmer bezels and lower weight add up to a marked improvement in handling and therefore the overall user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has also done well to improve what is arguably the 2014 edition Galaxy Note 10.1's most potent weapon - the S-Pen. The new features and apps make the active stylus even more useful and appealing to a much broader audience - you don't need to be a graphic designer to take full advantage of Action notes or the Scrapbooker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another area that has been so vastly improved to become a key selling point is multi-tasking. The upgraded Multi-view brings Android tablets another step closer to being able to properly rival netbooks. And with 3GB of RAM and a choice of two of the most potent chipsets around, you can bet the hardware can easily keep up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is very close to the full deal - an impressively productive tool, a web and multimedia powerhouse. But will that be enough for Samsung to finally make the impact in premium tablets that has alluded them so far? After all, the competition hasn't been fooling around either and has quite a few interesting alternatives to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first name that springs to mind is the Sony Xperia Tablet Z. One of the best-looking slates around, the Xperia Tablet Z also has waterproofing going for it, which may as well make up for the older chipset and screen not as sharp. The Sony tablet is also cheaper without sacrificing expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Tablet Z Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more recent option, the Asus Transformer Pad TF701T matches the Galaxy Note's screen for size and resolution, and runs on the extremely capable Nvidia Tegra 4 chipset and Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the real strength of the Transformer Pad TF701T lies in the dedicated mobile dock complete with a hardware QWERTY keyboard, trackpad, extra battery, SD reader and USB ports. Once you attach the thing to your tabled, you've assembled a perfect netbook device. The only thing missing is GSM/3G/LTE connectivity but, on a positive note, it costs as much as the Note 10.1 2014 Edition, dock included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Transformer Pad TF701T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Apple iPad Air is the one to really fear. The latest iteration of the tablet that started it all is a lecture in hardware perfection - slimmer and lighter than the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition, it still delivers blazing fast performance and excellent battery life. At base price, the iPad Air is also a tad cheaper than the Note 10.1, but it offers no memory expansion options, so you are likely to be spending more than you would on the Galaxy tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the Apple iPad Air has no direct response to the S Pen, but it has the world's richest selection of apps specially optimized for tablets and smartphone history has taught us that this is the most potent weapon of them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So at the end of the day, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition has enough to be one of the must-see gadgets for avid media consumers, but business-minded users too. The Transformer Pad looks capable of edging ahead in terms of productivity, but the rest of the stablemates seem to have little on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems unlikely though, even with the across-the-board upgrades over the predecessor, that the latest Galaxy Note 10.1 will upset Apple's dominance in tablets. For one, the iPads now come in pairs but it could also be down to a prevailing belief that only Apple can get away with a price tag this high.</paragraph>
