			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To say there are great expectations of the freshly announced HTC One (M8) would be a massive understatement. This is, after all, one of the flagships to shape the entire season. But a predecessor that failed to turn warm reception into good sales is adding more weight on its shoulders. The Taiwanese manufacturer's confidence may've been shaken but the new one cannot afford to show it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a quick glance, the HTC One (M8) appears to be a solid upgrade to what was already a highly-acclaimed smartphone. Perfecting the instantly recognizable, gorgeous design of the first generation, HTC has improved the latest flagship in several key areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good looks of the HTC One (M8) are backed by the most powerful hardware available on the market today, while the screen has grown at the expense of the capacitive keys thus keeping the body size in check. The software has received a boost too - the new HTC One runs the latest Android version, dressed in a brand new edition of Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation HTC One addresses most of his predecessor's major shortcomings. The chipset upgrade is hardly a surprise, but the fact that HTC has shown enough flexibility to include a microSD card slot is great news and the improved ergonomics come as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the original, the biggest question mark in the new HTC One (M8) is hanging over the camera. HTC insists on the 4MP sensor and has chosen to teach it cool new tricks rather than up the pixel count - that's the same questionable move that got it into trouble with the last generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time, there is a second camera unit to collect distance data, which enables some really nice effects in post processing. However, we are yet to see if that will be enough at a time when the competition is moving to larger sensors and 5 times the resolution of the One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will not waste any more time introducing the HTC One (M8) and we'll get down to testing instead. As always, we will begin our in-depth review with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Familiar retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) ships in the exact same retail package as its predecessor. Inside the nicely-looking box, you will find the handset, a charger, microUSB cable, a pin for ejecting the SIM and microSD card, a stereo headset, and the usual printouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the basics go, the HTC M8 has you covered right out of the box. Additionally, there will be a host of extra accessories at launch. They range from cool-looking cases to a BoomBass mini speaker and others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is an absolute stunner in the flesh. Unmistakably related to its predecessor, the new HTC One is even more elegant thanks to a body with even more metal (90% vs. 70% for the first generation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More metal in the M8's construction has resulted in lovely-looking curved metal edges. They offer a massive visual improvement over the polycarbonate frame of the first generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) will launch in three colors - Gunmetal Gray, Glacial Silver (the same as in the first generation), as well as Amber Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Introduced into the HTC One lineup for the first time, Gunmetal Gray is considered the headline color for the device. With brushed metal finish, it looks amazing in person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is outstanding. Like its predecessor, the HTC One (M8) is superbly put together. Its finish can easily rival that of much more expensive smartphones from dedicated luxury brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical measures of the HTC One (M8) are 146 x 70.6 x 9.3mm, and it tips the scales at 160 grams. The smartphone has grown a bit compared to the previous version, which wasn't that compact to begin with. True, the screen is 0.3" bigger now, but there are no keys below it, so we were hoping HTC will manage to fit within the same frame. In comparison, the LG G2 is 7.5mm shorter despite packing an even larger, 5.2", screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a thickness of 9.3mm, the M8 isn't the slimmest around either, and while we believe the stereo speakers and the metal body are well worth a bit of extra bulk, we can't help but point out that competition is already getting very close to 8mm. It's not that the One (M8) is unwieldy or anything, but more compact size and a slimmer waistline contribute to the high-end feel which is a key ingredient of the flagship experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the front-facing 5MP camera, alongside ambient light and proximity sensors. The top speaker takes the role of an earpiece during calls. It also accommodates the device's status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom speaker and a lonely HTC logo sit below the display. The mouthpiece is likely located within the speaker grille, as its nowhere else to be seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nano-SIM card slot is located on the left side of the device. The volume rocker and the microSD card slot are on the right side of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC M8 is home to the IR port and the power/lock key and. The latter is more conveniently located and the button itself is more tactile than the overly flush key on the first-gen One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB/charging port and the 3.5mm audio jack are located at the bottom of the new HTC One. We find the new location of the audio jack quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC M8's back is where the much talked about dual camera sits along a new two-tone dual-LED flash. The lines which cut through the metal are designated for the device's multiple antennas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the smartphone will also be home to carrier branding. Its extent will vary depending on the wireless provider.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the second generation HTC One is an absolute pleasure. The curved back and rounded metal edges deliver a superb feel in hand, while the traditionally placed on-screen navigation buttons are a welcome departure from the awkward dual-key setup of the previous model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In line with our high expectations, the HTC One (M8) deserves nothing but praise for its design and finish. The smartphone has retained the wonderful visual presence of the original, yet it looks fresh thanks to the new color schemes and evolved design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ergonomics have been improved too. Despite growing slightly in size compared to its predecessor, the HTC M8 feels and handles better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) features a 5" Full HD IPS display with a pixel density of 441ppi. The display has grown by 12% over the predecessor's and now it accommodates almost permanently visible on-screen navigating buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Taiwanese manufacturer has always equipped its flagship devices with quality displays and their latest is no exception - the M8 boasts one of the best 1080p displays in business, the wide viewing angles and great sunlight legibility one of its most valuable assets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got commendable contrast too, though obviously a little short of AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To better handle the rigors of daily life the display of the HTC One is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has a slightly bigger battery than its predecessor, but it has to feed a bigger screen and more powerful chipset. The end result is a great improvement in endurance rating - from 48 hours to 71 hours, practically a full day more!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of that improvement comes from a leap in 3G call performance, the One (M8) beats the old One by over six hours. The two proceed to trade blows in the web browsing and video playback times with an hour of difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our routine also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For more details, check out our blog post about the HTC One (M8) battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: After the HTC One (M8) received its Lollipop update we decided to retest the battery life and see if things have gotten better or worse. It turned out that some things had deteriorated but the overall image is better. The HTC One (M8) managed some 6 hours of call time and 1 hour of video playback less but scored 3 hours more on video playback. The stand-by times were better as well rounding up an endurance rating under Lollipop that's 6 hours better than on KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more details in our post on Lollipop battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important addition to the battery efficiency arsenal of the HTC M8 is the presence of the Extreme Power Saving mode, not unlike what the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S5 has. Only allowing access to basic features such as calls, email and text messaging , HTC claims the said mode will stretch a mere 5% of charge left to a whopping 15 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software features of the smartphone, headed by a brand-new HTC Sense UI, running on top of the latest Android build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.4.2 KitKat with brand new Sense 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) boots Android 4.4.2 KitKat, dressed in a brand new version of HTC's own Sense UI. HTC Sense 6 brings new features on board and improves the existing functionality of the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a quick video of HTC One with Sense 6 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen looks different but hasn't changed its functionality. There's a clock, weather info and four shortcut slots. Missed calls and incoming messages are duly displayed too of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up the unlock button gives you three different options. Swiping up takes you to the last app you used, while swiping to the left or to the right will take you to the homescreen or BlinkFeed respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful new HTC Sense 6 feature is the ability to unlock the device via a swiping gesture while its display is turned off - that's the new Motion Launch feature. Swiping up in portrait mode unlocks the device. Swiping down activates a voice calling feature, while swiping left and right takes you to the homescreen and BlinkFeed respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the display of the HTC One (M8) can wake up with a double tap. The gesture takes you to the lockscreen. A second double tap on the lockscreen would turn the screen back off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on the homescreen however doesn't lock back the smartphone. The double tap functionality is only available on the lockscreen to allow users to quickly look up time and notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the biggest change to the UI layout introduced by the Sense 6 is the presence of on-screen navigation buttons bringing the One in line with what most other makers have. This move has allowed them to get rid of the buttons under the screen, but it also has a certain downside. The buttons are almost always present (fullscreen images and videos excluded) and thus they eat up some of the available screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the One (M8) is once again reserved for HTC BlinkFeed. It aggregates content from your social networks, as well as from over a thousand news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're not stuck with BlinkFeed if you don't like it - the rest of the homescreen panes are the standard affair with shortcuts and widgets. You can also fully remove the BlinkFeed panel if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual - you get notifications in the right page and quick toggles in the left. You can access the quick toggles by a tap in the upper right corner or through a two finger swipe from the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to five homescreen panes to fill with shortcuts and widgets (the sixth is reserved for BlinkFeed). You can set any of the panes as default - including the BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are pulled out of a dedicated container as opposed to being displayed in the app drawer next to the apps, which we find to be the more intuitive approach. Adding a widget is as simple as long-pressing it and assigning it to the desired screen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default layout of the app drawer is a 3 x 4 grid of app icons, which does not make best use of the large, high-res screen. The icons aren't even bigger than usual; they just have plenty of padding. Luckily, you can switch to a 4 x 5 grid. You can sort app icons alphabetically or chronologically or have a custom sorting like you would on iOS, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has remodeled the task switching interface - recent apps can now be accessed via a dedicated on-screen button. They are displayed in a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails, which makes good use of the available screen size and resolution. It's a single screen that cannot be scrolled, so nine of the most recently used apps are the most you can get (which is far from ideal).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu isn't dramatically changed in the latest Sense. It has the same design, but with single-color, flat icons and toggles. Everything is where you'd expect it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized via a dedicated menu. This time around, the lockscreen styles cannot be changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, HTC Sense has a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are five big controls shown by default alongside the clock and weather. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and for Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One (M8) also has a built-in restricted access Kid mode. It is an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset with 2.3GHz quad-core Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU. Found in the latest crop of high-end Android devices, the hardware setup of the M8 is as capable as it gets these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: we re-ran some benchmarks after the Android 5.0 Lollipop landed on the One (M8), you can find more about the change in performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start you off with Benchmark Pi and Linpack, which evaluate CPU performance in single and multi-core mode, respectively. The HTC One (M8) did well in both tests, though, curiously, its single-core performance in Benchmark Pi did not top our charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is where the M8's CPU and memory speed are put to a test. Once again, the handset did a stellar job, but couldn't reach the top of the charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also traditionally put the reviewed phones through the Basemark OS II. Rightware distributes anti-cheat versions of their popular Basemark OS II (for general performance) and Basemark X (for 3D performance) tests. We've run both version and we found HTC One (M8) scores equally, which means the company isn't using any tricks to boost the benchmarks' overall performance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Overall, the HTC One (M8) performs as expected for a device of its stature. Considered as only a minor upgrade over the Snapdragon 800, the Snapdragon 801 brings welcome boost in GPU performance as the numbers above show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life, we found the M8 to offer extremely fast and fluid user experience. We didn't expect any less from the smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 6 has seen some minor visual changes, but retains the same functionality as its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, contacts, groups (including favorite contacts), as well as a call log. You can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays the contact's social networking updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One (M8) displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing and it works as expected. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone packs a neat set of call-related tricks, such as automatically answering a call when you raise the device to your ear or automatically silencing the ring of an incoming call just by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, the BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers are one of the One (M8) selling points. HTC claims they've improved them over the first-generation found on the original One and have made them 25% louder. And while the quality does seem a bit better, our test shows that the smartphone isn't any louder in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the HTC One (M8) managed to get a lower score than its predecessor. It's not too far behind it, but the little differences left it with an Average score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC M8 is capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. There's also Google Hangouts, which can connect you to Google contacts via either texts or video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One (M8) lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keyboard offers well-spaced keys, but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them. This is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 5" display diagonal offers plenty of space for comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the T9 Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to type. It works really well but language support is limited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 6 features Zoe as a standalone multimedia app, which requires you to sign in with your HTC account the first time you open it. Captured photos and videos are automatically compiled into a Zoe video highlight reel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a Zoe is easy. You simply choose from the available images and rearrange them in order you like. Themes and soundtracks are available in case you want to be truly creative. Once finished editing, you can easily share Zoes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe also allows you to collaborate with friends on the same project. You can send requests and combine your media content into the same Zoe.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Viewing images on the large display is a pleasure. The image gallery stacks photos together in albums which can be organized by the date they were captured or the source they come from. Location-based sorting is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is an array of available options at your disposal. You can edit, share, highlight, and delete images. You can also set them as backgrounds, assign them to contacts, add them to a specific album, or print them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC One has a rather simple interface. There isn't a dedicated app - you just pick a video from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to capture images from the video, volume slider, and sharing options. All hide automatically after a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Supported video file formats include .3gp, .3g2, .mp4, .wmv, and .avi. BoomSound is enabled by default on the video player while on speakers and cannot be turned off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music Player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense 6 music player features similar layout as the one in the previous version. The flattened interface design however makes the setup look new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is organized by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only), and search for lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board. You have the option to toggle Boomsound audio on or off with the headphones on. Like we mentioned already, you cannot disable the feature when playing through the speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough only one of the HTC One (M8) units we got to play with turned out to have a built-in FM radio. The European version comes with an FM Radio receiver and an FM radio preinstalled, while the Verizon unit lacked an app. It's anyone's guess whether the hardware is still there and has been disabled (meaning that it can be unlocked with some sort of mod) or if it's gone altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Best audio output in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) audio quality is by far the best we've seen a mobile device produce so far - and that's including tablets. Even its impressive predecessor pales in comparison with the latest HTC flagship, which is not only the loudest around, but also delivers perfectly clean output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) did perfectly in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels higher than every other mobile device on the market right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's virtually no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises so little that it remains better than what some smartphones deliver without headphones. The rest of the readings remain perfect too, while the volume is as high as they come. What do you know - dropping the Beats logo actually led to even more spectacular performance by the HTC flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is still stuck at 4MP, but has a host of new features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new HTC One (M8) has much the same camera as last year. It's based on the same 1/3" 4MP camera sensor with a 28mm wide F/2.0 lens. The sensor has an 16:9 aspect ratio and outputs a maximum 2688 x 1520 pixel resolution, while switching to the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio limits the maximum resolution to 2048 x 1520 pixels, or just over 3MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selfies are a big thing for the HTC One (M8). The front snapper now has a 5MP sensor, coupled with a F2.0 wide angle lens. That puts the HTC One (M8) in the awkward position of being the first smartophone with a front snapper of higher resolution than the back one. It should tell you something about how big selfies have become as a use case. Furthermore, not only do you get a dedicated Selfie camera shooting mode in the camera UI, but you can also quickly change to the front snapper with a single vertical swipe across the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) main camera however is accompanied by second camera on the back of the phone. It doesn't take any pictures, as it's a sort of a rangefinder. Its job is to create a depth map of your scene, which allows you to add high-quality rendered effects such as background blur (faux bokeh) or refocus your images after the shot. It can even allow for 3D-like photos with an extra layer of depth, which is visible when you tilt the phone (a parallax view).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the optical image stabilization that the original HTC One enjoyed was not compatible with the dual camera setup in the HTC One (M8). Hence the new cameraphone only relies on digital image stabilization. HTC however claims, it's as good as last year's OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new image stabilization is made possible thanks to the new generation of HTC image processing chip - dubbed HTC ImageChip 2. It caters not only to image stabilization, but also makes sure you get sharper images with less noise and better overall quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has a new autofocus system, allowing for faster than ever performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) also comes with a redesigned Dual LED flash (Smart Flash, as they call it). Much like the one on the iPhone 5s, it utilizes two LEDs in different colors (a warm and a cool one). The camera system can analyze the available scene light and by mixing and matching the temperature (the color of light) of the combined light output by the two LEDs, it produces more natural illumination for your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A clever new accelerometer-based trick allows you to start the camera directly even while the phone is locked in standby. With the screen off and the phone in landscape orientation, pressing one of the volume key activates the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this sounds great, but we can't help but show less enthusiasm for primary 4MP camera, which HTC is reusing here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year HTC hoped the bigger Ultrapixels on the 4MP sensor might offset the lower resolution and no matter what little chance they had back then, this year it's seems to be gone. The competition's cameras are simply too far ahead. High-quality 16MP and 20MP sensors can produce much more detailed images than even the best 4MP sensor and some of them already make clever use of pixel binning to produced higher quality lower resolution shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, bigger pixels (ultrapixels as HTC markets them) mean lower noise levels and usually, better dynamic range. But modern day cameraphones are already doing pretty well with noise levels and the best implementations of HDR modes can successfully offset the dynamic range advantages of the HTC One sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary rangefinder camera sounds gimmicky to us. While we're sure it does a fine job, the resulting faux bokeh generated by the phone is hardly convincing. It doesn't look much better or much more accurate than on cameraphones with a single camera setup. Also Sony's cameraphones have long been able of capturing stereoscopic images with a single camera and already all of Nokia, Samsung and LG offer selective refocus after the shot. So we're not quite sure that the trade-off for the OIS was quite worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) camera interface has been redesigned in tune to the rest of the UI. As before, since default aspect of the still camera matches that of the videos - 16:9, you don't need to worry about framing different aspects on the same viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You choice of shooting modes includes: Still camera, Video, Zoe camera, Selfie, Dual Capture (front and back camera simultaneously) and 360-degree Panorama. The Zoe Camera shooting mode records the necessary video and images to create the beautiful animated photo reels that you will find in the dedicated Zoe app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new thing about the Zoe Camera mode is that you can record videos longer than the default 3s if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several full-resolution 4MP camera samples (16:9 aspect ratio). We are quite happy with the results. There is a noticeable improvement in daylight image quality over the original One. These are certainly the best 4MP photos we've seen. However we are not quite sure whether that would be enough for the HTC One to match its competitors this year. We have more camera shootouts planned ahead, so it would take some time to get back to you with a final verdict.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are more camera samples. These were accidentally shot in 4:3 aspect ratio so they essentially have been cropped to 3MP. The per-pixel quality however is the same as the 4MP images with an aspect ratio of 16:9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Yet more camera samples, these shot in our usual locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also added the HTC One (M8) to our Photo quality comparison tool:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC One (M8) in our photo comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two low light shots. We used the new flash for the second one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ones without flash came out at ISO640 and ISO500 respectively. At shutter speeds of around 1/15s we had few keepers due to camera shake. The lack of an optical image stabilization was evident. Detail is not as high as would have liked but there is very little noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash didn't provide the natural looking result we were promised. We would have to test that further on other (less furry) subjects that hopefully have some skin tones to pass a final verdict.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special shooting modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is well capable of shooting HDR stills but we are not quite happy with the results. We've already reviewed several HTC models that use the same processing logic - the shadows get too bright as the expense of the highlights, which get overblown. The new HTC One certainly follows the same rulebook. We'll try and show you more HDR examples in the near future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: more HDR shots:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360-degree Panorama is not as hot as we expected. Disregarding the unsuitable scene that we've picked, the resolution is too low (it's was varying but was less than 450px on all attempts we made).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the stitching is nice and relatively seamless and image quality is nice despite the low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a nice example of the faux bokeh effect that the HTC One (M8) is able to produce. Unfortunately, not all samples turn out as good as this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up we've prepared a few demonstrations of the new image effects, which are made possible thanks to the dual camera setup. The last one is the stereoscopic image produced by the camera. When it's not on the phone, it doesn't look much different than the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One can shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. The camcorder features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 format with AAC audio. The audio is recorded in stereo. The video bitrate is 19.6Mbps, which is about the same as the original One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos come out nice and fluid and they are full of fine detail. Unfortunately, you can notice the shakiness caused by the lack of an optical image stabilization system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an HDR option for the video, but we haven't had the time to test this one out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a FullHD video sample captured with the HTC One (M8) that we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's also an untouched 1080p video sample (0:15s, 36.8MB) taken straight off the HTC One. You can also have a look at the HTC One (M8) in our Video compare tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) packs just about every connectivity available for-end smartphone today. You get quad-band GSM, quad-band 3G and market-dependent LTE support, making the One a true globetrotter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with the high-quality aptX codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is present too. We found it to work with no hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's microSD card slot too with support for card with up to 128GB of storage. In addition to it, the device also comes with 50GB of free Google Drive storage for two years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot is on board too. It supports WEP, WPA or WPA2 encryption. The app can be set to power off automatically after a defined period of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One also has a built-in Infrared port, which, coupled with the excellent remote app, allows you to remotely control a whole host of living room equipment. The smartphone can be setup to control all sorts of TVs, receivers, various video and audio players - pretty much any gadget that uses the standard Infrared remote controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the 1080p resolution of the display, watching video on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome interface hasn't changed since its launch for Android and is clean and minimalist. At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Drive comes pre-installed on the HTC One (M8). It brings all of your documents, presentations, forms and spreadsheets from the browser-based Drive along with folders, etc. You can create only docs and spreadsheets on the mobile version of the app. You can also snap photos and the app transforms them into PDF scans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense 6 calendar on has flatter look, but the same functionality as its predecessor. It has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it sources info from AccuWeather (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) comes with a GPS receiver which supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI or go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are data efficient. You can choose an area of the map, which should be available for offline use. Address search however is not possible for the offline maps content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android 4.4.2 KitKat, the HTC One (M8) has access to all the good which the Google Play store has to offer. You get to your account, My Apps, My wishlist and parts of it through a side menu a la Google+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is neatly organized in categories. They include apps, games, music, movies &amp; TV shows, and a newsstand. In short, you can find all the content you will ever need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Superb to look at and hold and extremely capable, the HTC One (M8) is a proper flagship smartphone. The development team behind it deserves praise for improving the strengths of the first generation while also addressing some of its biggest shortcomings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal body has been improved and while the front facing speakers have been matched by Sony they are still a strong point in favor of the One (M8), against the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G2. The presence of a microSD card slot means HTC's finest is also getting the cheaper memory expansion afforded to many of its rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset got an update to Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 801, meaning that the KitKat-topping Sense 6.0 runs as smooth as you'd expect. Speaking of the latest version of the HTC launcher, the new gesture controls and notification area toggles go a long way towards improving the user experience. Android purists will also appreciate that the M8, like its predecessor, will be available in Google Play Edition guise. HTC has even partnered with Google to bring support for its dual camera to stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we can't avoid the elephant in the room that is the One's (M8) camera setup. After the UltraPixel backfired last year, you would've thought the company would go for a safer option this time around. Fewer but bigger instead of more but smaller pixels sounded great on paper but the company underdelivered and all the supposed advantages of the bigger pixels simply weren't there, demoting the original HTC One to an also-ran in the cameraphone race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are back for another round this year, but unfortunately, we doubt the same 4MP sensor will take them any further. If last year's move brought them a financial bruise or two, it's only going to get uglier this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, last year, about the time the HTC One was announced (February 2013), most competitors still had 8MP cameras with the Xperia Z being the only one with 13MP (image quality wasn't much better than an 8MP camera anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The year was soon to bring a huge improvement in cameraphones though. The Lumia 1020 brought its 41 MP PureView tech to the table and Nokia followed it up with a couple of 20MP devices (Lumia Icon, Lumia 1520). The Samsung Galaxy S4, the Galaxy Note 3 and the LG G2 all came forward in 2013 with mature, high-quality 13M cameras on board. Sony went even further and by now, it has introduced not one, but three 20MP smartphones (Xperia Z1, Z1 Compact and Z2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all. Top-of-the-shelf smartphones in 2014 all record 4K video (Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3, LG G Pro 2, Sony Xperia Z2). And they are certainly not kidding around, image and video quality is awesome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what does the HTC One (M8) have on its side? It's got an improved 4MP camera, overcomplicated hardware trickery, which is only used for the seemingly trivial task of adding image effects in post-processing, and a mere 1080p video recording. That's all. Even last year's optical image stabilization - a key selling feature - is now gone as it's incompatible with the dual camera setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't take this wrong. We love the metal body and the gorgeous display of the old and new HTC One. But if HTC found it to be a hard sell last year, they haven't seen anything. This year, the 4MP camera will be even harder to get away with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you think we're being too hard on the HTC One (M8), think again. Camera comparisons with the other flagships are something the One will have to deal with. And they won't be any less tough. Then again, if all your shots end up in Facebook, this might not matter all that much to you. And the new 5MP front-facer can certainly do wonders for your selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's have a look at what the competition has in response to the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is this season's Android hot favorite and with a faster 2.5GHz CPU and a higher-res 16MP camera with 4K video recording, it's quite a handful. The Korean flagship is no longer the ugly duckling of the flagship bunch with its leather-imitating back and while it can't quite match the metal-clad One (M8) for aesthetics, it has a far slimmer and lighter body that is also waterproof to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) does look like the underdog in this battle on paper, but there's more than specs involved here. Where you stand on the TouchWiz vs Sense question will probably be a decider as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is the other noteworthy competitor, although if you happen to live in the US, you may wait for quite a while to get it. With a marvelous glass-and-metal waterproof body, stereo speakers and a 20MP camera, the Z2 is a force to be reckoned with. The overly wide bezels are what brings this particular package down, but things have certainly improved since the Z1 came around, so these are no longer the deal-breaker they used to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 looks a bit old in this company, but it provides much of the same flagship experience at a lower price tag. It has to make do with a Snapdragon 800 chipset, rather than 801, but offers a 13MP OIS camera and innovative rear-mounted keys and unmatched screen-to-footprint ratio. Looks are definitely in favor of the One (M8) here though and so is expandable storage - so the extra bucks are probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things have never been so close at the top of the premium segment. HTC has a key advantage here as, despite being the last to announce it, it will be the first to actually start selling its flagship. And a couple of weeks' worth of an advantage might be make or break in a market where the top makers are fighting over every inch - and using roughly the same ammo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, HTC will have to play its PR cards right and put the right spin on what looks like a camera blunder second year in a row. On a second thought, sticking that gorgeous metal body in the hands of the customers might just be enough.</paragraph>
