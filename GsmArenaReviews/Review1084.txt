		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For one reason or another, the One series failed to live up to their potential in terms of actual sales, so HTC turned back to the time-tested Desire line to fill up the coffers and secure some time to regroup. A new attack on the high-end market takes months of preparation and it's up to devices like the Desire X to hold the line in the meantime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X is a smartphone that few will lust after, but it's one that many will end up owning. The bells and whistles offered by flagships come at a price, while a solid smartphone experience and nice clean look is what most people really need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the quick rundown of the HTC Desire X strengths and weaknesses:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A solid dual-core chipset, a relatively recent Android release (as far as midrange droids go) and a reasonably spec'd display. There' nothing groundbreaking about the HTC Desire X, but no glaring omissions either and that's what counts in the cutthroat battle that is the smartphone midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being so well prepared, the HTC Desire X is not afraid of any contender and, at this price point, it might be one of the best deals HTC has offered for quite some time. If it can really squeeze all the performance out of those solid specs, the Desire X might even be one of the devices to watch this holiday season.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get down to testing then.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is par for the course<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X retail package is a pretty standard affair - you get a charger, a USB cable and a basic headset. As with most other Beats audio-featuring HTC smartphones, there're no Beats audio headphones, supplied in the package, so all the label on the back means is that you'd be getting the special equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no memory card included either, but given the 4GB of internal storage and the fact that keeping the price down is key in this market segment, we are willing to let that go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire X 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X shares its chassis with the HTC Desire V. At 118.5 x 62.3 x 9.3 mm, the Desire X will easily slip into pockets and allow comfortable single-handed use. Entirely made of plastic, it weighs 114 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The styling of the HTC Desire X is simple and to-the-point. The smartphone is certainly among the better looking in its price range, with the matte plastic on the back looking quite sleek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bezel at the front is quite slim, too, which give the Desire X a more high-end look. The only part of the smartphone we are not particularly fond of is the black glossy plate surrounding the camera lens and the LED flash. While we are okay with an accent around the camera, this one is clearly too much to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find a small earpiece. The proximity and ambient light sensors are well hidden in the screen bezel nearby. Unfortunately the Desire X omits a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the usual layout of Back, Home and Task Switcher capacitive keys. Their icons are painted white and light up when you tap on the screen. They offer haptic feedback too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side accommodates the microUSB port for charging and computer connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right we find the long and thin volume rocker. You can use its down button in combination with the power key to take screenshots of the Desire X interface. Sadly, there's no camera key here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top and a power/lock button. The latter is centrally placed right above the earpiece and the unusual position may be something to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the device features only the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of the Desire X has a rubbery feel to it and is virtually fingerprint-proof. It feels nice to touch and offers excellent grip. The 5MP auto-focus camera lens and the single LED flash share a finely grooved metal plate in the top left corner. Below the HTC logo is the loudspeaker grille, with the Beats Audio logo at the very bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is somewhat hard to remove, but the upside is it fits firmly in place and gives the handset its solid feel. The SIM compartment is unobstructed by the battery and the micro SD slot is hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've conducted our battery test on the HTC Desire X and the results are not bad. If you do an hour of talking, web browsing and watching video you'd need to hook up the phone to a power source every 42 hours. Here's the full break down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X packs a 4" LCD display of WVGA resolution (480x800), which is more, in terms of both size and resolution, than you get with the Desire C.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the screen is quite good, particularly given that we are talking a mid-range smartphone here. We expected the HTC Desire X screen to be identical to that of the HTC Desire V, but in reality it did way better in our tests. We are not sure if that's due to the smartphone having a different unit or to variances in production, but the upgrade is quite significant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native contrast of the screen is actually quite good, even if the maximum brightness is lower than that of the Desire V. The viewing angles haven't improved significantly though and are still only okay. Sunlight legibility is also slightly better.

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire X is built to a high standard and, despite the all plastic body, it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There's no premium finish but the excellent grip and comfortable handling make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that feels out of place is the huge camera plate at the back. If you can live with that, you'll find the Desire X a pleasure to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That about wraps it up on the outside, Ice Cream Sandwich and Sense UI are coming up right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android ICS with the latest Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X comes with Android 4.0.4 and Sense 4.0. In spite of not being the latest Android release, it still comes as quite an achievement, considering the majority of the Desire X competitors are still stuck with Gingerbread. We've seen this particular combo of ICS and Sense several times already on the HTC One series phones, but it's still interesting to see it perform on a much more affordable device like the Desire X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the UI in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is trimmed down just like it was on the HTC Desire V. What's missing compared to the One X and the One S is Leap View. The Recent Apps interface is the vanilla ICS layout. The lockscreen shortcuts can be customized but you'll need to change the four docked icons on the homescreen - by default you get Phone, Mail, Messages and Camera. The lockscreen is also active, meaning you can choose from People, Photo album, Productivity lockscreen and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is quite efficient. There are the usual four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You can either drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone, or any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of homescreens is locked at five, like on the Desire V, you cannot add or remove any. There is no leap view either. You get an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a brand new dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense offers one of the most full-featured customization suites around. The proprietary Scenes interface lets you choose from various custom homescreen setups, which provide new wallpaper and widget sets that can be further customized to suit your needs. This version of Sense only comes with one preloaded, but hitting the 'Get More' button on the upper right will take you to the HTC Hub where you can download additional Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you want to quickly change your phone's functionality, such as going from work to home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements. The Desire X comes with a total of two preloaded skins, although like with Scenes, it's easy to get more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Drawer uses a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in a similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes since Sense went ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main problem here is with how widgets are selected - they are shown four at a time and there's a lot of scrolling involved. Widgets are available in multiple versions - usually differing in size, but also functionality - and they're all dumped into the list, so you're scrolling through a lot of duplicates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old setup of picking a widget and then adjusting its size (if applicable) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two fields appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You can drop the widget on either one to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it is highlighted, Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area no longer has the list of recent apps - it's reserved for notifications only. No more tabs and toggles either, although you get a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the task switcher button on any screen displays a list of all your recently accessed apps, which you can remove with a swipe to the left or right. This is really just a quick way to access apps you've used recently, as swiping away doesn't kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To actually terminate a running app, you have to close it via the traditional task manager we've become familiar with from Gingerbread. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Stop All button too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X is powered by a Snapdraggon chipset, featuring two 1 GHz Cortex-A5 CPU cores and the Adreno 203 GPU. The smartphone also offers 768 MB worth of RAM, all of which adds up to a pretty good combination for this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi focuses on the CPU's calculative performance. Given that it has no love for multi-core processors, you would expect the Desire X to fail quite miserably here, but it actually produced a pretty decent score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu gives the smartphone an all-round grade for processing (calculative and graphic, memory speed, SD card writing, etc). Here the Desire X came surprisingly close to the Galaxy S III mini, which should have a larger performance edge in theory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another processing benchmark, Linpack shows the Desire X to be a capable performer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider and BrowsermMark test the Desire X browsing performance. The first one is a pure Javascript benchmark, while the second one ads a dash of HTML 5 to the mix.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the Adreno 203 GPU gets a stress test in NenaMark 2. It got a promising 35.4 frames per second, which means that most light to moderately heavy games should run trouble-free on the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion the Desire X did slightly better than its specs sheet suggest. It's obviously not a benchmark champion, but the dual-core chipset does a solid job of making the Sense 4 UI run smoothly over Ice Cream Sandwich, which is quite good for a mid-range droid. The occasional hiccup was noticeable, but nothing too damaging to the user experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does a solid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire X has HTC's elaborate phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have your contact list, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Google contacts, Facebook, or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and the fourth one called "Gallery" pulls up all the albums that contact has created on Flickr or Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. You can link to another contact or Facebook account pressing the "chains" icon in the upper right of the main contact screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transfer app is here to help you switch from your old phone. It supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth. It's an old but useful feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the Desire X displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keypad, contacts will be filtered by name and by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the Desire X displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire X packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone over when ringing will mute the ringer, turning it over in a call will activate the loudspeaker, and there's a Pocket mode to boosts ringing volume when the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the Desire X are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's the Google+ Messenger, which can connect you to Google chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it. Furthermore, you can choose which SIM card to handle the text message delivery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Desire X boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. Texting takes a bit of getting used to in portrait mode, which is understandable given the small screen size. Still, it's enough to get the job done and things get a little better if you flip the phone to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can either add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple mail services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the Desire X lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android-ish gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery is a custom job, but stacks photos just like the vanilla Android gallery. The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can choose to show/hide camera shots, All photos or All videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Albums dropdown lets you view local or online albums. On the cloud side, you get Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, Picasa or SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos. Some files have an icon indicating it's not a still photo but a video instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'll need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom up to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player onboard the HTC Desire X, which means that video files have to be accessed via the Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video interface offers a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video support on the Desire X was pretty good. It was able to play most AVI, MP4, MKV files we threw at it though it did choke on some old XviD-encoded AVI videos. DivX had problems with audio sync but worked fine with AAC audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available, although you have to have a subtitle file in the same directory as the video to be able access the subtitle options. These include the ability to select a subtitle file (if there is more than one in the same directory), as well as adjust the character encoding, which can be useful in getting those non-Latin subtitles to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can also opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire X offers the Beats Audio sound enhancement to boost the sonic experience, although at a slightly dumbed-down variant. Gone are all the Beats Audio presets we're used to in other HTC phones, all you're really able to do on the Desire X is toggle it on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a widget that shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can pause playback or skip tracks directly by pressing the relevant button but you cannot unlock the phone into the full featured Music Player by dragging the widget into the ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can play the sound through the headphones or the loudspeaker, although you need to have a headset plugged in at all times to be used as an antenna. There's no Beats enhancement here though, or a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a data connection, you can use TuneIn radio instead of relying on your local FM radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output test was another area, where we noticed a significat difference between the HTC Desire X and the Desire V. The dual-core smartphone not only outperformed its dual-SIM sibling, but it posted some of the most impressive scores we have seen from the company's devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Desire X get excellent scores all over the field. There are no weak points to its performance and combined with the above average volume levels, this makes up for a pretty solid showing here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there is virtually no degradation when headphones come into play. Some intermodulation distortion creeps in, but that's hardly detectable in anything but lab conditions. Amazingly the stereo crosstalk reading was unaffected and the overall output was certainly among the cleanest we have seen in this scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shared camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X packs a 5MP auto-focus camera that does stills of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels and records VGA video @ 30fps. There is a LED flash, but unfortunately no shutter key, which would've been useful given the presence of autofocus. At least, touch focusing is present, so you can use that instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions, with the option to either take a video or snap a still image all from one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo/video taken. On the left are buttons for general settings and shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the virtual shutter button. To record video, you tap the button below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the dual interface convenient, but it does have a few drawbacks. For one, if you're shooting video at the highest resolution possible, VGA, once you hit the record button the frame shrinks down to 4:3. This can make framing a bit tricky, as you don't get to see the actual dimensions of the image until you start recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on), while the shot mode button offers just a few very limited options - portrait, landscape, and low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 MP camera onboard the Desire X does okay in terms of speed of focus and capture but leaves something to be desired in terms of image quality. The amount of resolved detail is hardly worth writing home about, as it seems that the overly aggressive noise reduction wipes out most of the fine detail. Colors aren't very accurate, either, and there's notable fringing. Neither of those is bad enough to make photos unusable for sharing on Facebook and similarly less-demanding tasks, but you shouldn't expect wonders from this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's camera also features HDR mode, which we were also able to test during our review. The HDR effect is a bit too exaggerated and the stitching of images leads to some artifacts (not the leaves in the upper right corner of the first shot), but the result is not too bad. In fact HDR is probably, the better part of the HTC Desire X camera performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WVGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The WVGA (800 x 480) recording capabilities of the Desire X are nothing to write home about, especially in this day and age when it seems that every other device out there is capable of 720p recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of HD video recording is made worse by the fact that the Desire X is actually a dual-core smartphone, which should be able to handle at least 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you can get past the low resolution, the camcorder itself has quality similar to that seen in the still image samples - slightly-skewed white balance and low amount of resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here a video sample from the HTC Desire X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files and have a variable fps which generally hovers around the 28fps mark with a bitrate of around 3Mbps. Audio gets recorded at a sampling rate of 44kHz, a bitrate of 96Kbps and is mono.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an untouched VGA@30fps sample for download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ample connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G, and HSDPA speeds of up to 7.2 Mbps. Local wireless connectivity features Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are most often used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users"? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great ICS browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X comes with the latest Android web browser, and because it runs on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, you can also install Chrome for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser's interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. You get the standard Menu dropdown on the right, but HTC have thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen (you have to pan to reveal them, which is a little annoying).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner. Incognito tabs are available if you want to bypass History, tracking cookies, form auto-fill stuff and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu options include a toggle to enable/disable Flash and another one to request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another ICS feature has the phone preload search results that it suspects you're going to open, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no Flash player preinstalled on the HTC Desire X so you'd need to sideload it if Flash content is important for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great-looking PIM tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Desire X, with a mobile Office app to boot, that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word, Excel documents and presentations. There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can format the text style and color, justify the text, do lists (numbered or bullet points) in the Word editor. The Excel editor does support function editing, which some mobile editors don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also integrates with Dropbox and SkyDrive, which makes syncing documents between your computer and your phone a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), one you sync with your computer and easily show/hide events you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire X features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app. There's a world clock, to display the time in multiple locations, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo's weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store and HTC Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, the HTC Hub is a good source of wallpapers and sound customizations - ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handful of apps, as well as customizations for skins and entire scenes as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Navigation and location with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire X has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has done a good job of equipping its Desire X mid-range fighter. Its dual-core chipset gives you a smooth ride around the UI and garnished it with decent app performance, while the build quality and display are among the better in this price range. More importantly, the smartphone has just one major weakness, which can break the deal for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chink in the Desire X armor is, of course, video recording - 720p is the very least you could expect from a dual-core CPU these days. Even HTC?s own One V does HD video and that one only has a single-core processor at its heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if video recording isn?t all that important to you or if you are willing to live with WVGA clips, you would be getting a special treat. Unlike most of its competitors, the Desire X comes with Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box and knowing HTC?s record it will probably get at least an update or two in the coming months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But does the HTC Desire X have what it takes to survive in the mid-range ? delivering more bang for your buck than its competitors? To answer that we?ll have to take a look at the competition first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is all over the Android smartphone map and has smartphones to cover every price point. It has no less than three representatives in the mid-range battle. The first of those is the Galaxy S Advance comes with a matching price tag, a more contrasty 4" Super AMOLED screen, a more capable dual-core processor and a 5 MP camera with 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also has TouchWiz UI on tap, which is slightly more functional, if not as nice looking as Sense UI. On the other hand the S Advance is nowhere near as nice looking as the HTC Desire X and the PenTile matrix of its screen reduces its perceived sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 brings the same dual-core chipset as the S Advance, 720p video recording and an LCD screen at a notably lower pice than the Desire X. The only areas where the Ace 2 loses to the Desire X are screen size (3.8? vs 4?) and looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third Samsung contestant is the recently announced Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini. The compact smartphone might not be as powerful as its best-selling namesake, but it can still outperform the Desire X and it runs Jelly Bean out of the box. The Galaxy S III mini also offers more internal storage, but it also costs more than the Desire X, coming dangerously close to the territory of some former flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also has a couple of interesting devices in this price range. The Xperia U and Xperia sola are both noticeably cheaper than the Desire X, and they both come with higher resolution screens, 720p video recording and Cortex-A9 dual-core processors. What can hold them back is the lack of Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box and, in the case of the Xperia U, the lack of a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia U &#x2022; Sony Xperia sola</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the HTC Desire X is not going to have the easiest of rides, but it might not be a complete outsider in this battle. Anyone who does lots of video recording on their smartphones is beyond HTC?s reach here, but maybe it?s not too late to lure some of the rest to the world of Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For that to happen however, HTC will have to readjust its expectations and give the Desire X a price cut. After all it?s not that the smartphone is doing worse than its competitors. On many occasions it?s the best of the mid-range lot. However, there?s no way we can justify spending that much more on it compared to a Galaxy Ace 2 or an Xperia sola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sort that out, HTC, and you might have a winner for the holiday season. Fail to do so and we?ll soon have forgotten that this one ever existed.</paragraph>
