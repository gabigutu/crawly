			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 Mango has hit the market with much fanfare and a slew of new devices. The Samsung Focus Flash for AT&amp;T is part of the aforementioned group. The American sibling of the Samsung Omnia W, together with its upscale partner, the Focus S has the difficult task of swaying people away from the established players, which Android and iOS devices are, by packing solid hardware, spanking new OS, and a budget price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After a quick look at the phone?s metal clad, all black body, and Super AMOLED screen however, the term ?budget? gets quickly pushed to the back of your mind. One might even argue, that the Focus Flash look more upscale than its bigger brother ? the Focus S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the inside, the two Windows Phone siblings from Samsung have a lot in common. Both devices are featuring a 1.4GHz Scorpion CPU, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset. This can be attributed to the stringent hardware requirements which Microsoft has toward the devices, running its mobile OS. In short ? it is difficult to divide the Windows Phone handsets into budget and high-end. The Samsung Focus Flash surely doesn?t mind this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Windows Phone 7 was clearly a work in progress when released, the latest Mango update has firmly put the OS on the path of credibility. App support is still quite limited, but Microsoft is working really hard in this direction by courting the top developers from the other OS ecosystems. All in all, given the financial power of the Redmond based software giant, we can reasonably expect the gap between Windows Phone and the top dogs to grow narrower as time progresses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash has the luxury of packing a fairly upmarket hardware (for a Windows Phone device), while being priced like an entry-level smartphone. Is it going to make it in a world of free iPhone and Android devices? This is what we are going to try and answer with this review. As always, we?ll kick things off with unboxing and a hardware inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Focus Flash is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A complete retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the retail box of the Samsung Focus Flash, you will find a charger, a USB cable, an in-ear stereo headset, as well as the usual set of booklets from AT&amp;T, Samsung and Microsoft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bundled stereo headset is definitely on the cheap side (we?ve seen great earbuds in Samsung retail boxes before). Given the phone?s price tag and the trend of omitting the accessory altogether lately by the carriers, we see no reason to complain. It is better than none at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, the Samsung Focus S is one of the most elegant and understated devices we?ve seen in quite a while. With a black color scheme and a Super AMOLED screen on board, there is practically no telling where the borders of the display are when it is on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has been going easy on the use of metal even in its top devices. The Focus Flash however, has a metal back cover. The rest of the materials used are Corning Gorilla Glass and high quality plastic. Judging by the build quality and design alone, we can hardly call the smartphone budget oriented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s measures come at 116 x 59 x 11 mm, and its weight tips the scale at 116 grams. For a modern day smartphone, the device is extremely pocketable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are already well familiar with the Super AMOLED screen technology. The 3.7? WVGA unit of the Samsung Focus Flash is easily the best screen in its class. With its deep blacks, high contrast, and superb viewing angles, the display enjoys a perfect relationship with the sleek Metro UI of the Windows Phone 7.5 OS. As a matter of fact, the Microsoft mobile OS is easily the best way to showcase the capabilities of the Super AMOLED technology (and vice versa, too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, you will find the Windows home hardware button, surrounded by a thin metal bezel, along with the touch sensitive back and search buttons on its sides. Above the display are the earpiece, the front-facing 1.3MP camera unit, as well as the ambient light and proximity sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker can be found on the left of the device. Its buttons are sturdily built and easy to access. A tiny latch for removing the battery cover keeps company to the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the device is the, usual for all Samsung made devices, power/lock button, accompanied by a dedicated camera button. The latter?s presence should make all users of Samsung made, Android devices quite jealous, as it is featured in the budget friendly Focus Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is a home to the standard 3.5mm audio jack and a secondary microphone for an active noise cancellation. The boot of the Samsung Focus Flash hosts the mouthpiece and the microUSB/charging port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the device is where the 5MP camera unit and its LED flash reside. The loudspeaker of the smartphone is located on the left side of the camera. The bottom part of the back cover is where the ?Windows Phone? sign can be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the paper thin battery cover is where the SIM card and the battery go. Don?t look for a microSD card as the device does not have one. In its latest mobile OS, Microsoft don?t seem too keen on having this ubiquitous for all smartphones feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1500mAh battery of the Focus Flash did a great job in our experience with it. It easily made it through a full day of heavy use. This is as good as most smartphones get these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s size and slightly curved back make it a pleasure to handle. The premium materials used in its making only add to the nice feeling.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software: Windows Phone 7.5 Mango<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash runs Windows Phone 7.5 Mango out of the box. The latest mobile OS to come from Microsoft is an incremental upgrade, compared with its predecessor, and brings a slew of new features. We have prepared a short video of the OS in action. See it below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main peculiarities of the Windows Phone OS is that it doesn?t allow any customizations from the manufacturers of handsets ? a feature which Android is well known about. Add to this the strict hardware requirements for the devices and there is very little wiggle room left for innovation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a square grid of Live tiles. Live tiles fit the broad concept of ?widget? but, unlike most widgets out there, they are very uniform with clear labels that indicate what each one of them does. They also show some quick info (e.g. number of messages, the date) but they are also the Windows Phone 7.5 equivalent of homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color theme of the interface is customizable ? the background can be dark or light and the color of the elements (e.g. the fill color of Live tiles) can be any one from a long list of available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a traditional list ? this is where all the hubs and installed apps are listed in alphabetical order. A press and hold reveals a context menu, which lets you ?pin? items to the homescreen (that is put their Live tile there) along with uninstall and also rate and review the app (if it?s an installed app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking has finally made its way to the Windows Phone OS with the Mango update. To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old fashioned way, which has the drawback of starting it over from the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (?cough?Android?cough?) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The People Hub is impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub takes on the responsibilities of the phonebook, but calling it a ?phonebook? is not very accurate. Instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term borrowed right out of Social Networking 101.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Deeper social networking support makes things even better. When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with the latest status update, is visible on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?What's New? tab works like its namesake in the People hub, but only shows updates from the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?Pictures? is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?History? tab gives you a complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?Me? card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the ?Me? card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, ?What's New? lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony lacks smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with the in-call quality or the reception of the Samsung Focus Flash. The device is right on par with the usually well performing Samsung offerings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A capable and intuitive messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Windows Phone 7.5 uses threaded view to organize your messages. When you start the app, you?ll see a list of conversations ? each conversation consists of multiple messages visualized as speech bubbles, which are ordered by the time they were sent/received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An empty speech bubble will hang at the bottom waiting for you to type a response. A message can have multiple recipients too by using the + button next to the recipient field. Just the first few letters of the contact?s name are needed ? the search feature will find it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn?t the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is a traditional virtual QWERTY with not too many surprises. It can suggest words as you type and correct spelling and also auto-capitalize letters after a full stop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The responsiveness was great and the spell correction turned out to be very accurate ? we were able to type very fast with very little practice. The overall experience was very positive and even heavy texters will be satisfied.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The gallery looks beautiful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub has been polished up a bit in Windows Phone Mango. There's a new People tab, which lets you browse photo albums by individual contacts or groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be shared via MMS, email or on a social network. You can pick one network to be available for quick sharing, which requires one tap less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an individual photo supports pinch zooming and you can easily upload the photo to Facebook or share it on some other service. There?s an option to automatically strip geo-tagging information before uploading it to online services ? that way your offline album will still be geo-tagged, but you won?t have to worry about privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the ?Pictures? hub will automatically pull photos from your SkyDrive, Windows Live and Facebook accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Zune handles the music and video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video players are simple and have straightforward interfaces. You won?t have any difficulties using them. Oddly enough, the equalizer, along with SRS sound effects can be found in the settings menu under the ?Sound effects? option. You cannot access them directly from the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can of course work in the background and there?s another nice shortcut ? when you press a volume key, the name of the currently playing track also appears along with play/pause, next and previous buttons (they can also scrub through the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the Focus Flash. The transcoding and transferring to the device however, can take quite a while (depending on your computer configuration).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS is on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash has an FM radio with a minimalistic interface. You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we found nothing to complain about the stereo quality of the Samsung Focus Flash. The audio output was clean and distortion free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 5MP camera does a decent job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash has a 5MP autofocus camera with LED flash. Still images have a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels, while videos go up to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We rarely get surprised by camera UI but Microsoft has managed to pull out another nice UI stunt here as well. A side slide to the right opens the last picture shot and a slide to the right brings back the camera's live view instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. But that feature cleverly doesn?t trigger if there?s something in front of the proximity sensor ? like the insides of your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its single-core CPU, we found the camera of the Samsung Focus Flash to be one of the fastest we have encountered. There is practically no lag in between taking pictures. Focusing is also very speedy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the camera image quality is nothing spectacular. Colors and contrast are nice but the limited dynamic range and the lack of fine detail even at the lowest ISO setting are disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared several sample photos for you. See them below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A 720p video shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record in two resolutions ? VGA or 720p. The camera defaults to VGA, which is frustrating ? if you forget to set it to 720p, the videos you thought were shot in HD will be at the much less impressive VGA resolution. As of WP Mango though, you have the option of saving your favorite settings as defaults.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is not far from what the still camera offers - which is not much. The videos are smooth but they lack fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p video sample of the Samsung Focus Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 720p@30fps video clip so you can check it out without the YouTube recompression.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything except Mass Storage mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity on the Samsung Focus Flash covers all the bases ? world-trotting quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and fast tri-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA support and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune app. It supports syncing over USB and Wi-Fi. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your device ? Windows Phone 7.5 doesn?t support Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you have a Mac, don?t worry ? the WP7 Connector for Mac will cater for Mac computer users with a Windows Phone 7 mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer will leave you satisfied<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone was updated in the latest version of Windows Phone and it improves the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is always visible (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling hasn?t been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother experience. Animation and the JavaScript engine have been retooled as well, compared to older versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has so much confidence in its latest mobile browser that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't be afraid to pit the phone against even a desktop browser - the tests are pretty demanding and if you're not running a recent version of the major desktop browsers, your computer will surely break a sweat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A full blow organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar prefers two view modes ? agenda and day view. You have month view too, but you can?t access it by side-swiping ? you need to use the soft key for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set multiple alarms ? each with its own name, ringing sound and repeat pattern. We set up ten and yet the add alarm button didn?t grey out ? the Focus Flash can handle more alarms than we know what to do with. There?s a basic calculator too, which has big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Office keeps getting better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office hub is an important part of the Windows Phone 7.5 package. The interface is identical to the other hubs and it?s the best mobile Office suite we?ve seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? OneNote, Documents and Locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub now offers Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing Search is there for you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the Bing website, there are new photos every day to serve as a background, but WP7 has one extra ? three squares on the photo, which give you three interesting facts about what?s in the picture. The copyright sign in the bottom right also reveals the location of the photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Marketplace expands every day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace has gotten a few tweaks since we last saw it. It?s organized into four main sections ?applications, games, music and the Samsung Zone. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, there is a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, a list of new releases, and top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is working really hard to increase the number of apps available in the Marketplace. The software giant has been quite successful in courting the most successful developers within its rival OS ecosystems and, currently, the most popular apps for Android and iOS can also be found available for Windows Phone as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps comes finally comes with driving directions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Maps is a core part of the Windows Phone experience and with the Mango update, it gives you driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then, when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, so it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it can come handy (especially if you've got a co-pilot) and, until Nokia joins the Windows Phone team, it's the best that the newest OS from Redmond can offer (oddly, WP6.5 had voice-guided navigation in the States).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app will also locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout, and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from the "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox Live is quite social<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?Xbox Live? branded games, are usually the premium offerings for Windows Phone. In the same fashion as the apps, the most popular titles available on the rival OS platforms can be found here as well. The only unpleasant surprise here, is the high price for the games, compared with the same ones on iOS and Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before wrapping up the review, we must give Microsoft a wave of standing ovations for enabling you to remove the proprietary AT&amp;T apps on the Samsung Focus Flash at your will. This enables you to have a stock looking Windows Phone UI, as well as saves you much needed space on the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash is a device, which will easily grow on you. A lot of this has to do with the low expectations which the smartphone?s price point predisposes you to have towards it when opening its box. We did however, mention already that Microsoft?s strict hardware requirements for Windows Phone devices all but erase the gap between high and low end devices, which pack its latest mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only major complaint about the device is its serious lack of built-in storage. Microsoft however, has partially offset this issue by giving you access to 25GB of cloud goodness with SkyDrive. You can help yourself in this department even further by opening a Dropbox account. We found a nice and free client for it in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Windows Phone 7.5 Mango release has become a well-polished and capable alternative to the top dogs in the industry. The lack of apps is its only major fault but Microsoft is hard at work to change this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were amazed by the smooth experience, which we had with the Samsung Focus Flash. Again, this fact can be easily explained with the hardware requirements from Microsoft. In an Apple fashion, the software giant has built its OS around specific hardware (in this case, it is Qualcomm made CPUs and chipsets), therefore omitting the possibility of it being a limitation to the overall experience. This is the reason why the Focus Flash shares the same 1.4GHz Scorpion CPU as its bigger brother ? the Samsung Focus S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus Flash is currently available exclusively at AT&amp;T Wireless for the highly acceptable $49.99 with a two year contract. It is now time to see what else you can get for the same kind of money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the latest crop of Windows Phone offerings, we can find one direct rival to the Focus Flash - the HTC Radar 4G, which is available for T-Mobile. The HTC product however, costs $99.99, while offering a slower 1GHz Snapdragon CPU. Its screen is also no match for the Super AMOLED unit of the Focus Flash.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you look within the AT&amp;T smartphone ranks, you will notice that the original Samsung Focus is still on sale with a fresh Mango update on board. It will cost you the same as the Focus Flash. The year-old Samsung offering will entice you with a bigger Super AMOLED screen and a microSD card slot on board. Its CPU however is slower at 1GHz, and the device is not as compact as the Focus Flash.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now, the Android ranks. The most notable alternative from within them comes from no other but Samsung itself. It is the Infuse 4G which, again, is offered exclusively on the AT&amp;T network. The Infuse 4G brings a lot more to the table than the Focus Flash. We begin with the massive 4.5? Super AMOLED Plus screen and an 8MP snapper. The list continues with 16GB of internal storage and microSD card slot. With the same price tag as the newcomer, the Infuse 4G simply has more to offer. In case you opt for it, we can guarantee you that Samsung won?t mind at all.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you bump up your budget by fifty bucks, you will enter iPhone 4 territory. The 8GB version will set you back $99.99. The same money will get you in the dual-core realm of Android offerings such as Motorola Atrix 2 and Droid X2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As you can see, there are plenty of Alternatives to the Samsung Focus Flash. The device however, is easily the most credible Windows Phone alternative for its price point. This fact alone should help it gather a decent following. As far as first time smartphone users go, they won?t be disappointed either. Having this is mind, it is a job well done.</paragraph>
