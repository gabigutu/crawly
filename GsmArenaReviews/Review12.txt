		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphone for the masses or feature phone of the future? Samsung would gladly have it either way. The question rather is, will the Bada OS keep up the pace of its debut device. We?ve been following the new smart platform since its first public appearance. It?s not a particularly hard one to follow anyway, with a single phone announced so far and potential successors of the Samsung S8500 Wave only a whisper of a rumor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will certainly take more ? and equally convincing ? devices for Bada to do as well as Samsung want it to. Proper developer support and a fast growing app store will be a must too. So, it?ll take hard work but there?s something to be optimistic about ? the firstborn is promising. OK, cautiously optimistic is more like it with Android, Windows Phone 7 or Symbian ^3 predators lurking around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re about to see what the Samsung S8500 Wave is really capable of. We?re getting ready to enjoy it. The S8500 Wave did well in our preview and - fingers crossed - unpleasant surprises are not on today?s menu. The OS is trying to combine feature-phone ease of use with the versatility of smartphones. The Super AMOLED touchscreen is the envy of the industry, with image quality that no other phone display could match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being the first of a kind has its implications. Some may be willing to forgive a few flaws but a brand new OS needs a flagship capable of facing up to the competition. The S8500 Wave fits the bill. Trademark Samsung exterior and premium build are inviting enough to encourage exploring a wealth of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 Wave tries to give it all and hopes the Samsung app store will eventually catch up. As good as this phone looks and feels, and for all the technology it holds inside, its success or failure hinges on the developer support it will get. The Apple app store took a year to open after the launch of iPhone but look at it now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there just aren?t enough Bada OS compatible applications yet so there?s little difference (beyond hardware) between the Samsung S8500 Wave and a Samsung S8000 Jet. Although it excels in user-friendliness, the Samsung Wave doesn?t quite feel like a smartpone just yet due to the limited third-party software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the other features, the S8500 Wave is powered by a Samsung-made 1GHz processor and has a great connectivity package. You get both HSDPA and HSUPA support, as well as Bluetooth v3.0 and Wi-Fi with WPS and Wi-Fi tethering. There?s a 5-megapixel camera with 720p video recording at 30fps, and an inbuilt GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 28.07.11: We've added an overview of Samsung Dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s on the inside though. Now, jump to the next page for a closer look at the Wave?s exterior and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung S8500 Wave<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave retail box is not nearly as inspiring as the phone itself. It covers the basics ? a Nokia copy-cat charger, a microUSB cable, a one-piece wired headset and some manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also enclosed is a 1GB microSD card but we suspect it won?t be enough for long HD video recording sessions. If you decide to go for the Wave you will surely need to buy a much larger memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8500 Wave 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 118 x 56 x 10.9 mm Samsung S8500 Wave is pretty compact and easy to slip in a pocket. Extra slim and solid, the handset?s the style is economic and effective. There isn't much space wasted around the screen either. The phone weighs 118 g, which is mostly attributed to the metallic body and scratch-resistant glass covering the screen. The phone feels nice to handle and looks quite durable too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave is a sleek device indeed and the styling is undeniably Samsung. We?re not quite sure about the diamond-shaped accents (Home key, camera lens, LED flash) but other than that, the exterior is handsome and conservative. There?s nothing to take the focus away from the brilliant screen. The slim metallic body is elegant and solid, and well resistant to fingerprints too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, are the only three hardware keys on the Samsung S8500 Wave front panel. The Call and End buttons are either side of central diamond-inspired Menu key. All controls are large enough and solid to press with excellent tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The End key doubles as a power button. It will terminate the currently running app and take you to the homescreen wherever you are in the interface. Pressing and holding the Menu key launches the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece and the video-call camera, along with the proximity sensor. Samsung Wave doesn't make use of an ambient light senor to change the display brightness dynamically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung S8500 Wave hosts the volume rocker, which, however thin, is prominent enough and very comfortable to use. On the right we only find the camera key and the lock button. Both are pretty tiny knobs but properly raised and tactile. The shutter key is soft and responsive, with distinct half-press position. The camera launches almost instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the microUSB port, hiding under a neat plastic lid that slides softly in and out. The uncovered 3.5mm audio jack and the loudspeaker grill are also there. At the bare bottom you?ll only see a mic hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave rear only hosts the unprotected 5-megapixel camera lens. There is a small LED flash next to it to help in low-light shoots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed aluminum surface on the metallic back is a real pleasure to use. Our only grudge is with the Samsung S8500 manufacturing. Obviously the battery cover is made separately and out of the five-or-so Samsung Wave units we saw recently most had their battery covers slightly off the color of the surrounding body panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's easily noticeable on the well-lit studio shots below. The difference varied on all units so when shopping for a Samsung Wave it?s perhaps better to check all the units available in store and pick the best one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum battery cover gets released by pressing a small knob at the bottom. Underneath is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery which is quoted at up to 450 hours of stand-by, up to 8 hours 30 minutes of talk-time and up to 35 hours of non-stop music playback. Those are solid numbers and in reality the Samsung Wave lasted more than 3 full days of some pretty heavy usage. You can check out the  dedicated battery test on the Samsung Wave in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the battery we find the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment. The memory card isn?t hot-swappable and we?re not happy with this design decision. It was the price to pay perhaps for the extra slim metal body. On a positive note, the phone handled a 16GB microSDHC card trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is very well built and that?s a good way to start. The economic styling befits the slim and solid phone, and the overall feel of the device is sharp and mature. We have no complaints about the controls and handling. And the screen? words can hardly describe the difference to regular LCD displays. It?s just beautiful simply to look at.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Beauty on display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No surprise in this form factor, the front of the Samsung S8500 Wave is dominated by the touchscreen, a 3.3? unit of WVGA resolution. But that?s dry stats ? a look at it is the beginning of a love affair. This phone does have a killer feature, only it?s not evident by just scanning the spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.3? 16M-color capacitive touchscreen on the Samsung S8500 Wave is no match for the 4? splendor of the Galaxy S. In terms of size, that is. All the rest is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display technology has a great edge over LCD in terms of contrast that?s no news. Super AMOLED screens have the deepest blacks we?ve seen on a mobile phone. Besides, color vibrance has got a boost too, which makes the S8500 Wave display image quality all the more impressive. The viewing angles are the best in business and outdoor visibility is remarkable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Samsung Wave doesn't make use of an ambient light senor to change the display brightness dynamically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz + Android = Bada<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We guess it's fashionable to roll out new operating systems. Google stepped up with Android, Nokia are making a new start with MeeGo, HTC have gone a step backwards with the Brew Mobile (is this a true operating system at all?). So, it was about time Samsung introduced their own OS as well. Meet the Bada OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get it straight, the Bada OS looks just like TouchWiz at first glance - with even more eye candy and with the option of running native apps on it. Samsung are waving the "Smartphones for everyone" flag but maybe it has less to do with affordability than ease of use. It took us only five minutes to start feeling right at home with the S8500 Wave UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a short video shot in our studio demonstrating the new Bada interface and its capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you know what to expect in a device that screams TouchWiz: not one, not two but as many as ten homescreens full of widgets. Each homescreen is like a part of a single panoramic desktop.The difference in scrolling between the icons and the background image add for a feeling of depth and added dimension ? just like in Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time widgets don't hide in a tray at the side but at the bottom - we saw a similar solution for the first time on the Samsung S5620 Monte. By the way, the TouchWiz UI on the Monte is made to resemble the look and feel of the Bada OS pretty closely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the Wave landscape while editing the widgets allows you to add or remove homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A certain novelty is the notification area. It's is a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info like battery, time and switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. When you pull it down you get a list of all recent notifications. Did we hear Android cry thief?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the most recent events or the minimized music player, for example, the notification bar also gives you a convenient 3-button control used for turning Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or sound alerts on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz or else, we're talking smartphone, so real multitasking is one thing you can count on with the S8500 Wave. The task manager is accessed by a long press on the Menu button so you can easily switch between currently active applications or terminate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, all available items and applications initially spreading across three screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons form a 3 x 4 grid and you can change their order the way you like, you can also move icons from one screen to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the homescreen, you can add or delete menu pages when you turn the phone landscape while you?re in edit menu mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last one you don?t have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you lock the screen while playing some music, you can easily access the dedicated music bar with a single tap. You?ll notice a small CD icon at the top of your lockscreen which opens &#x430; music console.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8500 Wave may use a brand new OS, but it shares identical UI looks with the Android-powered Galaxy S. The phonebook has rich functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory and SIM-stored contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen. Gradual typing search is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have added another cool feature to the phonebook, which is also available in the Android OS on Galaxy S. In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing works in other lists too where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave caused us no trouble during calls. There were no reception issues or in-call voice quality drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is some kind of smart dialing on board but it?s not exactly useful. Once you tap in some digits the Wave shows the contacts in your phonebook whose number contains them. Now, we don?t know if you have the habit of remembering the numbers of your contacts but we certainly don?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include muting, using the keypad, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log can be activated with the call receiver key. It shows all the dialed, received, missed calls or messages in one list, but there are also different tabs for easy sorting the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the S8500 Wave. It snatched a Good score, meaning missed calls are likely in much noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two major sections in the main menu - Messaging and Email. The Samsung S8500 Wave supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers folder (tabbed) view and conversation. The first one shows all your folders as tab at the bottom, while the conversation groups you messages by sender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, setting yours on the Samsung Wave is hassle-free. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you can tweak. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client looks exactly the same as the messaging one ? it uses the folder (tabbed) view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple accounts are also supported and you can switch among them any time. Unfortunately there is no shared inbox for all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 5 MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input package offers handwriting recognition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capacitive touchscreens usually won't give you handwriting recognition but the S8500 Wave is among the few exceptions. It certainly doesn't have the largest screen possible but handwriting recognition is there. As expected, you can hardly draw more than one character at a time but that's still something!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer typing to drawing, go for the on-screen keyboards. You get two options - a portrait numpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard. Given the not so big screen, the QWERTY keyboard is not the most comfortable. The keys could've been a bit bigger and better arranged - after all, the messages you compose don't need that much space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery or Media Browser, as Samsung call it, is basic - all images and clips are displayed all at once as small thumbs. When you select a file you can see it in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Samsung S8500 Wave multi-touch support but you can also double tap on the screen to zoom in and out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The best video player up to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia is certainly a S8500 Wave forte. The brilliant display is great for watching videos. The interface of the video player follows the logic of whole UI. Settings and options are a tap away, otherwise hidden when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave supports DivX/XviD files out of the box. Subtitles are welcome as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, you can search for a specific scene using the "Mosaic search" feature. It breaks the clip down to 16 or 36 parts and displays the first frame of each to help you find the scene you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played 720p videos like a champ. Not a big surprise considering it can record 720p videos, but still impressive for a mobile phone. We threw everything we had at it ? DivX, XviD, MP4 and even MKV files - all in 720p resolution. The Samsung Wave handled them smoothly and hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final really cool part of the video playback performance of the Wave is its battery life. We run a dedicated test and saw the Samsung S8500 play nearly nine hours of SD XviD video before it lost 90 percent of its battery charge and shut the video player off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has been redone as well. Tracks are sorted by albums, artists, genres, composers, etc. You can hide some of those sorting options if you don't use them. At the end only those that you've marked will be displayed on top of the screen (as tabs) while the ones you have unmarked will be gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major improvements however are only visible when you use the music player in landscape mode. Comparison to iPhone's Cover flow is inevitable with some important differences. Browsing albums or tracks is pretty standard in portrait mode: you get a list of all songs or albums, each with a small thumb. The list is smoothly scrollable with impressive kinetic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're browsing in landscape mode you'll be getting an album art arch of virtual CDs. Tapping on a CD will expand it to show all the tracks within the given album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, sweeping down across the screen (from the arrow above the central CD) will display a virtual dial to let you search the albums or tracks alphabetically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets and sound effects are also available. The Samsung Wave comes with Samsung?s proprietary DNSe sound enhancement technology that lets you pick among Wide, Concert Hall. Music clarity, Bass enhancement and Externalisation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of the music player is also the traditional Samsung music recognition feature that lets you record a few seconds of a currently playing track and it gets back to you with the name of the track and artist.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites that are accessible straight from the main screen. The rest of the available radio stations is still a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also listen to the FM radio on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM audio recording is also available. The recorded files are stored in decent MP3 format in your music folder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output spells perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We did expect the Samsung S8500 Wave to perform well in our traditional audio quality test but the results turned close to perfection. Not only is the Bada-pioneer one of the loudest handsets in terms of headphones volume, it is also among the ones with the cleanest output. The Nokia N91 is the only handset that we have ever measured to be noticeably louder than the Wave, but it didn't perform as well across the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is perfect for the entire audible range and deviation is impossible to detect even in lab conditions. The signal-to-noise ratio is also excellent and so are the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortions are also neatly kept and the decision to pronounce the S8500 Wave the perfect portable audio player couldn't be much easier than this really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The frequency response of the Samsung S8500 Wave and the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is perfect</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 5-megapixel snapper, great video recorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and capturing 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 camera viewfinder is quite reminiscent of company's recent cameraphones. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the bases are covered - ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, face and blink detection, geo-tagging etc. You can switch the default storage between the main memory and the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to use the touch focus feature, you need to double tap on the area you wish to focus on and then use the camera key to take a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave produces nice photos for a 5-megapixel cameraphone. The amount of resolved detail is very good and noise levels are kept under reasonable control. Sometimes the contrast seems a bit low, but most of the images are good enough. Here go the Samsung S8500 Wave samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Samsung S8500 Wave to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Samsung S8500 Wave image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave captures 720p@30fps videos. Unlike the Sony Ericsson Vivaz, the S8500 Wave doesn?t feature continuous autofocus during video recording. Samsung Wave however outputs videos at full 30fps (29.970 to be precise), while the Sony Ericsson Vivaz maxes out at 24fps.The Samsung Omnia HD was also trying out for a 24fps output but even with its latest firmware (March 2010) it hardly reaches that and its videos run around 20-22 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail is excellent, perhaps the best we?ve seen so far among the 720p competition. Contrast is good and the noise levels and compression are amazingly low. The price of the lower compression affects the file size ? 15 seconds of video take 20 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough talking, here's a video sample made by the Samsung S8500 Wave. You can check the original video file (22MB) as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave was also included in our Video Compare Tool database. Check it out ? the tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity and the Samsung Wave is no exception. All kinds of network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA (3.6Mbps) and HSUPA (2.0Mbps). The GSM/EDGE networking of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G in dual-band - 900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave is the first mobile phone to support the new Bluetooth version 3.0. Naturally, A2DP is also supported. To activate Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi), you can use the dedicated control hidden in the notification area on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps like the Samsung Store, Facebook or Twitter require a configured packet data profile and an active SIM card to use Wi-Fi connectivity. Still those services don?t actually use packet data instead of Wi-Fi, they just check if it?s available. Strange indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Wi-Fi connectivity, the Samsung Wave is also among the few phones to support the latest Wi-Fi 802.11 n connectivity standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi with WPS is also at hand. WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup and it's a hassle-free way to pair a wireless device with your secured network. As long as your wireless router supports the feature, pressing the dedicated button on it allows it to pair with the Samsung Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Mobile AP you can also turn your S8500 Wave into a wireless router for connecting up to three Wi-Fi clients that will use its HSDPA connection for Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 also packs a standard microUSB port. You can choose from 5 connection modes - Media player, Modem, Mass storage, Samsung Kies and USB debugging. Samsung Kies is the new software used to connect your Samsung mobile phone to a computer. In Mass Storage mode the phone mounts its internal memory (400MB) and the inserted memory card as removable drives on the computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser runs Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8500 Wave packs a Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser 2.0. You can have multiple pages opened at the same time and there is Flash video support on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser interface is reminiscent of the Samsung S8000 Jet. There's multi-touch support, so you can make use of the pinch-zooming feature. That's only one of the three available zooming options, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also double tap a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in on it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level. And last but not least, there comes the one-finger zooming which works flawlessly as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view mode. The text search option is also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no text reflow (dynamic refitting of text to match the width of the display port). Its job is to make sure the text won't run too wide, so that each line of text will fit horizontally on the screen (hence no need for horizontal scrolling).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another letdown of the Samsung Wave web browser is the lack of auto-complete when typing the address of already visited websites. The only help you get here is the ".com" button which can, eventually, save you 3 extra taps, nothing more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned the browser has full Flash support. The YouTube videos run even within the webpage itself, but there is significant lag between the video and audio so we recommend the mobile YouTube version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is the quick translate option. Tap and hold to select some text and then click on the translate button. You will be redirected into a new tab with opened Google Translate and loaded with your result. Nice one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave comes with bundled the latest Picsel Viewer. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office viewer is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. It also hosts the stop-watch and timer functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The System Manager was the first telltale sign the Wave is actually a smartphone. It consists of four tabs. The first one shows the device information (model number, firmware version, MAC addresses), the second one displays the battery info, while the third and the fourth inform you on the CPU usage and the memory status, respectively. Along with the CPU usage you can also see the currently running apps and you can start the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daily Briefing is the same as the dedicated widget ? it shows the weather, stocks and your current schedule. The app works only in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with only text, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also added native Twitter and Facebook clients on the Bada OS. They are nicely touch optimized and have similar looks and functionality as the respective apps for the iPhone and Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Search works on everything in your phone ? contacts, images, music, videos, emails, history, apps, etc. It works excellent and helps when you have lots of content. It also offers internet search with Google or Bing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a simple voice recorder app and Palringo IM are also onboard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Trial GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled navigation software on the Samsung S8500 Wave can easily turn the handset in a fully functional SatNav system - especially thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver on board. It comes with the Samsung Mobile Navigator, which is based on the Route66 mobile application. Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features, but the goodies come at an extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation software comes with 30-day trial license for voice-guided navigation (drive and walk). After that you?ll need a subscription, which is quite expensive. All other goodies require some extra payment and the whole package will cost you a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no native Google Maps at this stage, but we hope the app will hit the Bada OS application store soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three full games pre-installed on the Wave ? Asphalt 5, EDGE and Parachute Panic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asphalt 5 is the next installment of the popular series and uses the accelerometer for control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EDGE is a very simple game, which also uses the accelerometer to control a cube over a space platform. Your goal is one - to make it to the end of the level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Parachute Panic is very cute game ? some guys jump from planes and you must open their parachutes and help them land on the ships below. The game has very nice paper-like styling and is quite fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a bunch of demo games. They give you only about two minutes of gameplay each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Bada OS is still very young and its gaming potential is yet to be revealed in the future.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Samsung Apps store is promising<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS offers a native application repository from its start ? the Samsung Apps. Samsung has promised over a 100 apps to be in their store on the Wave?s launch. Currently there are only 60 apps and they are all free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems the payment system is not yet implemented and that may as well be the reason for the small number of apps available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps is very similar to the Android Market. It has three tabs ? featured, top and category view. There is also a download section and search option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole idea of an app store running from day one is great and with the SDK already available to the developers we believe the Samsung Apps will continue to grow in time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Dive locates your device, remote wipes it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Competition between phone makers is getting really heated, so they're offering more and more free services to lure in customers. Samsung Dive is a prime example - it's a phone finder/remote wipe service, something which used to be a premium, corporate-centric feature back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The officially supported devices currently include the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, along with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Tab 8.9 and the Samsung Wave. That's it, even the Galaxy S Plus isn?t listed. An exception we found is that the Samsung Wave II is supported too even though it's not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show here is the Remote Controls feature (actually, it's the only feature). It can locate your phone or you can set it to track the phone for 12 hours on, recording its position every 15 minutes. If you?ve only misplaced your phone, say, it?s behind the couch or your dog?s been using it as a bite toy (true story!), there's an option to ring the phone out loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if it turns out that the phone isn't in the house you have the option to lock the phone, wipe its memory and check the call logs to see if there were any calls made from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locking the phone lets you enter a message to display on the device (up to 100 characters) and you can enter a phone number, which will be the only number callable from the locked phone (you'll also get an SMS to that number if the SIM card is changed). A 4-digit PIN is also required, which can later be used to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that if you choose to wipe the device, you'll no longer be able to use Samsung Dive on it. You can re-register if you find it, but tracking will no longer work, which means remote wiping is your last resort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When trying to locate your device, you have two options - Find my phone and Track my phone. They may sound alike, but they do differ a bit. Track my phone records the phone's location in 15-minute intervals over a period of over 12 hours and plots the locations on the map (Google Maps is used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, for it to work, the phone needs to have a GPS lock - the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning won't cut it. So, if the phone is in a building or in another area with poor GPS signal, tracking won't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find my phone works fine with the less accurate options but it only shows the phone?s current location and it won't record past positions. The nice thing is that even if all location options were set to off before the handset was misplaced, those will be enabled automatically as soon as you start looking for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike HTCSense.com, Samsung Dive is purely for locating your device or remote wiping it. There are no options to view/manage contacts or messages or anything like that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is the first phone to run a brand new OS and this may look great on its resume but isn?t what makes it worthwhile. The potential is all there and the UI user-friendliness is at its peak so even if Bada OS never takes off, the Wave would make a perfect feature phone nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point the S8500 Wave is still a smartphone-to-be. With only a few available third party apps users will be right to have their doubts. But that would be something for Samsung and the Bada OS to sort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, how about the phone? We think the S8500 Wave is well worth its asking price and it would serve well the goal of paving the way to the mass market for a brand new OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a marvelous Super AMOLED touchscreen, a zippy 1GHz processor, a nice camera, solid multimedmedia capabilities and great connectivity. And those don?t depend on the number of Bada OS compatible apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not least, the Samsung S8500 Wave looks and handles great. It?s slim and solid, with perfect build and great performance. Just like a good throwing knife it?s perfectly balanced and feels like a tool that would handle any job you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a proper flagship ? only without a fleet. Samsung?s intentions about the Bada OS look serious enough but it doesn?t seem clear how the whole thing will shape up. It would make sense for the Bada OS to try and quickly populate the midrange and for Samsung to get the app store up to scratch as soon as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When ? and if ? this happens, the S8500 Wave will fit in place. It will be in charge of a lineup of mass-market smartphones to give loyal users plenty of upgrade options and let Samsung profit from their own app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point though, the Samsung S8500 Wave is a premium device, getting some heavy premium competition. We can only think of only one close rival that isn?t among the market?s heavy-hitters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian-powered Sony Ericsson Vivaz has an 8MP snapper but a smaller (and resistive) TFT screen. These are both feature-rich phones and the choice is hard. The Bada OS is better in terms of looks and touch experience but the amount of compatible apps is undoubtedly in favor of Symbian. It?s a tie we think in the video department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung i8910 Omnia HD ? Sony Ericsson Vivaz</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If spending more cash on a gadget isn?t a problem, there?s a great selection of first-class phones you might want to consider. The Nokia N8 is said to start shipping in the coming months at about 370 euro (before tax). It runs the refreshing Symbian^3 and promises to be a remarkable cameraphone: large-sensor 12-megapixel AF camera with Xenon flash. The N8 has an AMOLED touchscreen too (no Super AMOLED though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up are the HTC Desire and its twin-brother, the Google Nexus One. Both have a Snapdragon on board and 3.7? AMOLED touchscreen (no Super here either). 5MP autofocus cameras with WVGA video are in charge of imaging. The two Androids cost around 400 euro each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Android-powered option in this price bracket is the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. Its major advantages are the Snapdragon platform, the excellent camera, which is promised HD video recording later this year and the highly customized social-oriented UI. The XPERIA X10 TFT touchscreen measures 4 inches and delivers great image quality but can?t compete with the Wave?s Super AMOLED display (even if it is way smaller). The outdated Android version 1.6 is a letdown in its own right too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Desire ? HTC Google Nexus One ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, these are serious rivals up there but we guess it will be up to the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S to keep the industry?s finest at a safe distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I900 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while Samsung?s top Android is the most likely nominee to be Samsung?s top smartphone, the S8500 Wave will have to find its proper place. It?s not quite the smartphone it wants to be just yet. But the Wave is trying to make up for it with a brilliant screen, excellent UI usability, solid feature set and premium looks.</paragraph>
