			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in 2011 the smartphone landscape was seemingly starting to settle, when Samsung stirred things up by taking a wild leap with the original Galaxy Note. The 5.3" slate was called a monster back then and we all had to re-think our idea of the smartphone as a productivity tool. It certainly made a splash. Ugly and gargantuan to some, a real godsend for others, the original Note was a pioneer at heart and opened up doors to a whole new market segment. It sold over 10 million units and even helped coin the notion of phablet - a phone, which dares step in tablet territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Samsung's rivals were still rubbing their eyes in disbelief, the Note II came along. It quickly became a solid hit, already passing the 5 million units sales mark and guaranteed to beat the achievement of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough with the history lesson. As you would imagine, the competition wouldn't just sit at the sidelines and watch Samsung do victory laps. It was only a matter of time before somebody sent an equally capable rival the Note's way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meet the LG Optimus G Pro - a device built for the single purpose of running for the best phablet title.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As such, the Optimus G Pro just begs to be pitted against the Galaxy Note II. Let's see the most important advantages each of the contenders holds over its rival.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note II over LG Optimus G Pro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Right off the bat, the LG Optimus G Pro trumps the Galaxy Note II with a next generation chipset, giving it an edge in performance and, theoretically, power efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG continues to deal heavy blows in the display department. The Optimus G Pro boasts the best display on an LG device yet: 1920 x 1080 pixel True IPS+ LCD unit. The Note 2's 720p Super AMOLED display simply fades in comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department promises to be a nail-biter too. Both smartphones boast Sony-made camera sensors with LG having the upper hand with a 13MP unit, against Samsung's 8MP sensor. Megapixels mean nothing without good image processing, so we'll see how the Optimus G Pro stacks up against the Note II, which already proved to be a very solid performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware aside, both phablets enjoy the software optimizations that Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean provides whilst boasting the numerous proprietary features that their custom user interfaces add on top. Samsung has a bit of an edge there with its S Pen functionality, which takes the Galaxy Note II to a whole new level of possibilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whichever way you look at it, LG had the better part of a year to unleash a true Galaxy Note II killer. But is this going to be one-way traffic or can the prey outsmart the predator? We're about to see, starting with a physical right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro and Galaxy Note II have a lot in common in terms of looks and design. The Note II features the Samsung "nature inspired" design, and is smooth and rounded. LG, too, has opted for a similar look, straying away from the industrial design of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-glass build is gone too, as LG has leaned towards plastic with its phablet (we presume cost and weight concerns have played their role here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the omission, the glossy plastic back cover of the Optimus G Pro sports an interesting design, which reminds us of the Nexus 4 back. The pattern uses squares instead of dots, but they still "move" as you tilt the phone. The metallic LG and LTE logos are engraved on the plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Galaxy Note II looks similar with its hyperglaze finish (basically, there's a transparent layer over the opaque plastic), but lacks the punch of the moving dots. The plastic below the transparent layer has either a brushed aluminum pattern or no pattern at all (it depends on which color option you get).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find the LG Optimus G Pro a bit better looking, but perhaps it's our eyes clinging to the fresher design solution - Samsung's design has been around in one form or the other for more than a year now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving to the front, we find similarly sized screens; both measuring 5.5" with 16:9 aspect ratios. However, the LG Optimus G Pro takes the edge packing a 1080p resolution, while the Note II display is just 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll cover the screens in more detail in the next chapter, for now we'll focus on the rest of the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other items of interest on the front are the Android keys. Both handsets sport two capacitive and a Home button configuration. The Home button is in the center with the two capacitive keys placed on its left and right sides. The major difference here, is that LG has placed the back capacitive key on the left side of the Home button, while on the Note II, it's on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another slight distinction comes from the shorter, yet wider Home button of the Optimus G Pro. We find it a bit harder to press, compared to the Note II's taller, yet equally wide Home button. A nice touch by LG is the LED notification light which surrounds the Optimus G Pro home button and illuminates in various colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The similarities continue when taking a look at the controls and ports of both phones. They have the Power/Lock keys on their right and the volume rockers on their left. We find this configuration very usable, considering the mammoth size of both handsets - buttons are easy to reach and comfortable to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notably, the Optimus G Pro packs an additional button dubbed Q-Slide. It is placed on the top left side of the phone and is user customizable, which is nice to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the top and bottom sides of both phablets are similar as well, safe for the addition of an IR blaster next to the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Optimus G Pro. On the bottom, both phones pack MHL-enabled microUSB ports and a mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, on the bottom right, the Galaxy Note II has a special stylus slot for the S Pen, which is the smartphone's signature feature and enables some cool functionality together with the Note II Wacom digitizer. The stylus itself isn't perfectly round like the original S Pen, so it doesn't rotate in the slot, making it easier to put back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peek under the battery covers of the two phablets reveals a similar configuration: a hot-swappable microSD card slot, a microSIM card slot (obstructed by the battery on both devices) as well as a beefed-up battery. This means you can carry a spare battery and easily swap it when you run out of juice. More importantly, you can extend the storage on both phablets with a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have similarly large batteries - the one on the Note II is quoted to have a 3100mAh capacity, while the Optimus G Pro's has a typical capacity of 3140mAh. We'll take a close look at the battery life just as soon as we're done with this chapter and the screen comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cameras on the back of the phones are placed in the center and don't protrude as much as some other offerings from the companies' portfolios. As such, they aren't so prone to scratching and don't make the phones wobble as much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG Optimus G Pro has a more compact body, due to its smaller side bezels. Ultimately, this results in a better fit in hand compared to the Note II. Rather interestingly, both have exactly the same thickness - 9.4mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Optimus G Pro is 9g lighter, which while virtually unnoticeable at first, adds to the better in-hand feel and helps prolonged usage. At the end of the day, the Optimus G pro and Galaxy Note II are strikingly similar in their design and all of them are solidly built - we wouldn't advice you on picking either due to aesthetics or size alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: The LG Optimus G Pro. LG's smartphone has a fresher design and more compact size, even though the lack of an S Pen is both a downside and a reason for the more compact size.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the eye-grabbing 5.5" displays with 16:9 aspect ratio of both devices. However, this is where their similarities end, as the two are completely different from one another - one is an IPS LCD, while the other is uses the AMOLED technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the LG Optimus G Pro is of the True HD IPS Plus variety and packs a Full HD resolution. This results in a staggering pixel density of 401 pixels per inch even at this size. LG also claims that the Optimus G Pro screen produces 100% accurate color rendition and is faring a lot better than its rival in that aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II can't hold a candle to LG's offering in terms of resolution and pixel density - 720p resolution, making for just 267 pixels per inch. However, it's an Super AMOLED display, meaning colors are very saturated (with the option to tune then down if you prefer) and blacks are truly deep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Through the course of our testing we can safely confirm that on the Optimus G Pro images look indeed great. Colors pop and are represented very accurately. Still, the Galaxy Note II has better contrast (since the black pixels turn off) and the colors are oversatured (which is plus or a minus, depending on who you ask).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look at the two screens with a digital microscope we shot the matrices of both screens. You can clearly see how much bigger the Note II pixels are, which results in a lower perceived sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note II and LG Optimus G Pro screens up close </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the LG Optimus G and Galaxy Note II through our usual display tests and here's how it scored. You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However when it comes to sunlight legibility, the Galaxy Note II has a slight advantage against the Optimus G Pro, despite the extra Wacom digitizer that it employs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG Optimus G Pro. While the better contrast of the Galaxy Note II makes everything appear punchier and its sunlight legibility makes it the better choice outdoors, we believe productivity is key here and the LG Optuimus G Pro has the upper hand with its higher resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We test battery life in three important categories - talking on a 3G network, browsing the web over Wi-Fi and watching videos. Then we take those numbers, plus a standby reading and give each phone an endurance rating - it's our own estimation how long would the phone last on a single charge, if you do an hour of each activity per day and leave to rest in the standby for the rest of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's important to note that while both phones have very similarly sized batteries - 3140mAh for the Optimus G Pro and 3100mAh for the Note II - the LG's phablet uses a next-gen chipset, while the Samsung Galaxy Note II has the best of the outgoing generation of Exynos 4 chipsets and a more efficient AMOLED screen of lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calling is generally a test of how efficient the modem of each phone is - the screen is off and the CPU has nothing to do. The LG Optimus G Pro scores a major victory here, beating the Galaxy Note II by nearly 4 hours. The Optimus G Pro's score is so good, it nearly matches our all-time champion - Motorola RAZR MAXX.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With such a good start we were expecting to wait a long while before the web browser test completes on the Optimus G Pro, but it was over pretty quickly - 6 hours and 40 minutes to be precise. That's an hour and a half over what the regular Optimus G did, but over 2 hours less than the Samsung Galaxy Note II. Even though white screens are more taxing to AMOLED displays than LCDs, the lower resolution of the Samsung smartphone helped it to the convincing victory here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two phablets' 5.5" 16:9 screens offer great video-watching experience so it's natural to assume that many users will be doing a lot of movie playback on them. The LG Optimus G Pro went on for 8 hours and 40 minutes before its battery went from 100% to 10% (some video players refuse to play at under 10% battery charge, so this is our cut-off point), which is not a bad achievement, but couldn't come anywhere close to the Note II's time of 11 hours and 27 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, the LG Optimus G Pro scores an endurance rating of 50 hours, which came notably short of the Samsung Galaxy Note II 69 hours score. Surprisingly, the Galaxy Note II turned out to also have more efficient stand-by, despite its last-gen chipset. You can read about more our testing methodology here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note II. We were surprised by the margin of the victory the Samsung phablet achieved here, given the almost identical batteries. Obviously, the 1080p resolution is quite power-hungry and the newer chipset just can't make up for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both 5.5" phablets run Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean with their own custom UI skins on top, and are expecting to get the latest Jelly Bean update soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out both the Optimus and TouchWiz user interfaces in action here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies have reached virtually every corner of Android with their respective user interface skins. As of the time of writing, LG is at boasting the latest iteration of their Optimus UI in the Optimus G Pro, while the Note II is packing what is still (before the Galaxy S4 comes to the market) the latest TouchWiz UI. Both are as feature rich as a custom UI can get with usability boosts and software tricks everywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the lockscreens. Here, both phones offer more or less the same features such as lockscreen widgets, date and weather info (here LG gives you a choice of clock style), as well as shortcuts to apps. it's worth noting that Samsung offers two extra unlock methods - Face &amp; Voice and Motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II also offers a feature dubbed Quick glance. It presents at-a-glance info on the basics - while the phone is locked, you can cover the top of the Galaxy Note II (just trigger the proximity sensor, really) and the screen will light up and display the status bar, counters for missed calls and new messages, a battery percentage, music track info and upcoming alarms. In our unit, this would trigger even if the phablet is face down, so it might prove to be a battery draining feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going pass the lockscreen unveils the all too familiar Android homescreen configuration. Both phones allow you to have up to 7 panes that you can rearrange and set which one is the default. The shortcut docks on the bottom fit 4 customizable shortcuts on the Galaxy Note, while LG have given you the option of fitting 7 on the Optimus G Pro. Furthermore, you can fit 5 icons on a row outside this dock - one more than on the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, since both are running Jelly Bean, widgets are resizable (this was introduced in ICS) app shortcuts and widgets move out of the way when you place a new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification areas are similar and both feature connectivity toggles. A helpful trick on both phones is to long press a toggle, which brings out the corresponding Settings menu (e.g. GPS settings if you long-press the GPS toggle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a brightness slider on both phablets as well as a shortcut to the settings menu. The LG Optimus G takes an edge here by adding an additional row of shortcuts for QSlide apps. We'll talk about QSlide in a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, LG has given the boot to its implementation of a simple launcher dubbed Easy Home in the Optimus G Pro. On the Galaxy Note II, the feature is present, and is called Easy mode. Basically, it's a preset with big, thumbable widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing about it is that Easy mode and the default (Basic mode) remember separate arrangements on the homescreen, so you can use one for work widgets and one for personal widgets and easily switch between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An advanced feature that Samsung added to TouchWiz is Smart stay - it prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face. LG offers its own version of the feature, called Wise screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed the same trick from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Smart Stay - called Wise screen. It uses the front-facing camera to detect whether you're looking at the screen. This means you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the QSlide feature on the Optimus G Pro - LG's way of enhancing multitasking on the phablet. Samsung was first to the market to offers a similar trait, but with a different approach called Multi Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Window enhances the multitasking capabilities of the Galaxy Note II, allowing you to run two apps on the screen simultaneously. Mind you, not all Android apps are supported, but unlike the Galaxy Note 10.1, where only Samsung apps could be brought up to the screen, Multi-Window supports Google apps as well (Gmail, YouTube, Chrome and Talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for LG's QSlide, it too doesn't support all Android apps, and comes with only a short list of supported ones dubbed QSlide apps - QMemo, Web browser, Video, Calendar, Calculator, etc. Depending on the QSlide App that you launch, there are different shortcuts on the bottom bar, joined by an icon to resize the QSlide window. The unique feature here is the slider, which directly controls the opacity of the QSlide layer. This way the underlying user interface can be more or less visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the previous version of QSlide, now you can move the QSlide window around the UI to a place you find best. You can also chose whether the foreground QSlide app or background UI to be active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A really exclusive feature of the Galaxy Note II is its S Pen functionality, which is truly is pivotal to the phablet's experience. It has a vast array of features that are a great usability boost over what can be done with just finger tips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen provides another way to launch apps - with gestures. You press the S Pen button and swipe up to access Quick command. Here you can draw a "@" sign to launch email, "?" to do a quick search, "#" to dial a number or "~" to send a text. Besides the symbol you can add a keyword - what to search for with the "?" or define search range for the "@": recipient, message body or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II screen can detect the S Pen from a distance, similar to how the Galaxy Note 10.1 worked. The hover feature, called Air View, is not part of the stylus though. Thanks to its more sensitive digitizer, the Note II can distinguish between 1024 different levels of pressure and you can really feel the difference in the drawing apps - you get fine-grained control between thin and thick lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video from Samsung that does a great job of showcasing all the S Pen features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note II. While both offer excellently functional user interfaces with a number of cool home-baked treats, the extra dimension that the S Pen adds gives this round to the Samsung smartphone. You can call this a tie if you don't plan on using the stylus, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II is powered by a Samsung-made Exynos 4412 Quad chipset with four Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.6GHz, 2GB of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU. In 2012 that was one of the fastest chipset available, but now it shows its age when compared directly to the Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, LG's offering boasts the brand new Snapdragon 600 chipset with four Krait 300 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, 2GB of RAM and the Adreno 320 GPU. With specs like that you would expect the phablet to wipe the floor with its competitor and that's pretty much what you'll get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro came on top on the Benchmark Pi and Linpack tests, which are meant to judge single and multi-core performance respectively. The Galaxy Note II couldn't come close to its rival in either test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" LG flagship had excellent performance in the Quadrant compound benchmarks we ran, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Optimus G Pro and the Adreno 320 GPU residing in it didn't disappoint and offered nearly twice the raw power of the the Mali-400 GPU in the Note II. The again, given that the Galaxy Note II has less than half the pixels of its opponent, the real-life gaming performance is quite on par on those two (of course you'll be getting more detailed graphics on the Optimus G Pro).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up are browser benchmarks, where the Samsung optimizations helped the Note II make up some ground. SunSpider is all about pure JavaScript performance and the Samsung phablet managed to beat its rival, scoring its first victory for the day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG Optimus G Pro. The Snapdragon 600 platform is way newer than the Samsung-made Exynos 4410, which has been around for more than a year now, and it clearly shows in the benchmark scores of the two. It is commendable, though, that the Galaxy Note II was able to successfully stand its ground in terms of JavaScript and graphics performance (the latter - thanks to its lower resolution).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comparing a 13MP camera and an 8MP camera might seem like comparing the strength of a heavyweight and a lightweight boxer, but higher resolution doesn't necessarily mean better image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones use customized camera interfaces, but they are pretty similar in terms of both look and functionality. You get a column of customizable shortcuts on the left and another bar with the shutter key, the still camera/camcorder toggle and a gallery shortcut on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG Optimus G Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Note II can shoot panoramas, HDR photos, burst shots, and take photos during video capture. They also offer face detection and a voice-activated shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro has that humpback volume rocker that can be used as a hardware shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option that LG has added is the so-called Time machine camera. It continuously snaps photos in the background, waiting for you to press the shutter. And when you do, it saves several of the photos captured before you pressed the shutter and several after. This way you can capture the right moment even if you don't have cat-like reflexes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature the Optimus G Pro has over the Galaxy Note II is the VR Panorama. It's basically another name for Google's Photo Sphere mode. You snap one central photo and then move the phone around to fill out as much of the sphere as you want, blue rectangles appear to guide you. Since Galaxy Note II will be getting the Android 4.2.2 update, the Google's Photo Sphere will become available on its camera as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro produces very nice and sharp 13MP samples. The conservative noise reduction makes sure much detail is preserved, but results in noisier shadows. Furthermore, the noise gets even more intrusive because of the sharpening, which emphasizes it. The regularly underexposed shadows don't help matters much either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera of the Samsung Galaxy Note II has pretty similar per-pixel quality to the Optimus G Pro, but the lower-res sensor means it can't quite keep up with its rival. Still its noise reduction is better though and the noise levels are much lower in the shadows. The shadows sometimes get underexposed too, but not as often as on the Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II offers slightly oversaturated colors, while the samples from the Optimus G Pro look more natural and close to the reality. Some users would prefer the pumped up colors, but the more natural output will probably be the choice for most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that both cameras have virtually the same field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution camera samples if you want to take a look a better look and do some pixel peeping yourself. We should note that those were not taken at the same time, but the lighting conditions were similar enough to give a good idea of the photo capabilities of the two smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixel peepers can also head over to our Photo compare tool. Take a close look at the synthetic resolution chart (the first one), it tries to gauge the captured resolution for cameras. The LG Optimus G Pro has a slight advantage there, but it's no nearly as great as the resolution difference suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus G Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy Note II in our Photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG Optimus G Pro. Both cameras turned out to be very good, but the LG smartphone made the extra resolution of its sensor count. </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video cameras of both phones have user interfaces identical to their still cameras and in turn, practically identical to each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Optimus G Pro and Galaxy Note II support image capturing while video recording. The Galaxy Note II captures 6MP images (its maximum resolution in 16:9 mode), while the Optimus G Pro snaps only 2MP (that's barely a feature as that's the resolution of the individual frames in the video).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung Galaxy Note II and LG Optimus G Pro support touch focus during video recording. You just need to tap somewhere on the screen of the Galaxy Note II to focus there and the phone turns off the auto-focus until you re-enable it with a dedicated virtual key. The Optimus G Pro does this in a different manner - after you tap to focus somewhere, the auto-focus doesn't turn off, so when you switch the scene you won't have to worry about anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing the Galaxy Note II does better is it can pause during video recording so you can have multiple scenes in the same video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro counters with one of the coolest video-related features we have seen recently - dual video recording. The LG flagship can record 1080p videos at 30fps with both of its cameras simultaneously. It looks a lot like video calling with the video feed from one camera filling the screen and the other shown in a small window. You can tap the viewfinder to swap the cameras, even during video recording. You can also resize and move the small window. That kind of recording really helps you become a part of the scene rather than just a witness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II also feature a front-facing camera but its video recording is limited up to 720p@30 fps and can't do dual-recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Optimus G Pro offers HDR video recording unlike the Galaxy Note II. It does improve the dynamic range but we'd recommend against using it - the contrast of the videos is nearly ruined, and it smears much of the fine detail, while adding noise and messing up the colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones record video at up to 1080p@30fps in .MP4 files and use almost identical bitrate - 17Mbps. The Optimus, however, goes a bit higher with the audio bitrate (160Kbps vs. 120Kbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, for the LG Optimus G Pro, despite the fact that the camcorder specs are identical, the captured videos are quite different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro videos are smooth at 30fps but the level of fine detail is lower than the best 1080p shooters, the sharpening is strong, the dynamic range is on the low side and the colors are off. The hunting for autofocus and the shifting of automatic exposure are trigger way too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung did a commendable job with the Galaxy Note II video recording and the results are way better than those of its competitor today. The resolved detail is nothing short of excellent, the frame rate is steady, even small details and movements are captured (like the blades of grass swaying in the wind) with very little noise. Colors are a bit oversaturated like in the still images, but that tends to be better accepted in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, despite the LG Optimus G Pro offers more features in the video camera department, the Galaxy Note II is the better when comes to actual results. And we can't see how often someone will use the dual video recording with the Optimus G Pro, while the pause option on the Galaxy Note II is a welcome perk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch the video samples we captured, just don't forget to pick 1080p and view them in full screen. Again the samples were captured some time apart, but the lighting conditions are similar enough to make them comparable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download 1080p@30fps untouched samples taken with the  LG Optimus G Pro and the  Samsung Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, you are welcome to take a trip to our Video compare tool and see how the two compare there in the controlled environment of our studio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus G Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy Note II in our Video compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note II. While the dual-recording may be the coolest feature of the season, the quality of the videos produced by the Note II is notably better than those shot with its competitor. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones have quad-band 2G connectivity. The Optimus G Pro supports dual-band HSPA, while the Samsung Galaxy Note II has a version with tri-band (N7105) and a version quad-band (N7100) support. Depending on which Note II model you get, you either receive HSDPA speed of 21 Mbps (N7100) or 42 Mbps (N7105). The Optimus G Pro HSDPA goes as high as 42Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II N7105 also supports quad-band LTE cat.3. The Optimus G Pro also features LTE cat.3 connectivity, but there is no official info on the supported bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local wireless connectivity is almost identical - dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are all supported. Both phones offer more advanced features too - DLNA, Android Beam and Wi-Fi Direct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support HD TV-Out too via the microUSB MHL support. Unfortunately, the compatible HDMI MHL cable for Note II won't work on the Optimus G Pro and vice versa. There's also USB On-The-Go support, which means you can connect various USB peripherals - mice, keyboards and USB storage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a tie, both phones are clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy Note II and the LG Optimus G Pro posted some excellent scores in our audio quality test. The Note II is a tiny bit cleaner and a notch louder, but the differences a really hard to detect with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when we plugged a pair of headphones, the output stayed impressively close (and good). Of course, the stereo crosstalk reading takes a hit on both phones, more notably on the Galaxy Note II. Still, both phones provide solid and on par performance even with the headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see how these two compare for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance on par<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though the Samsung Galaxy Note II was 7+ db louder than the LG Optimus G Pro when playing the old-fashioned phone ringing ringtone, it wasn't enough to push up the Note II higher than a Good score, which is the exact same rating as the LG Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about our loudspeaker testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note II (only just). In terms of loudness, the Note II seems to have a small advantage when playing back high-pitched tones, but it's a pretty close call otherwise. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We come to the end of our first phablet shootout. It was only logical that the market segment that experienced staggering growth over the past year and a half will start producing fierce clashes of its own. Samsung has certainly enjoyed the time when it was alone at the top and took full advantage of it, but the competition has finally caught up and is ready to trade blows with the Note lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG was the first to try and offer an alternative after the Note went mainstream, but its first attempt failed miserably. The Optimus Vu just tried too hard to set itself apart from the Galaxy Note with its 4:3 screen and became unwieldy in the process. Truth be told, LG wasn't ready to offer a proper alternative back then, so that gamble might have been its only choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are way different now. The LG Optimus G Pro was specifically designed to be the Galaxy Note killer and it doesn't fear facing the Samsung phablet on its own turf. It may be coming late to the market, but it has certainly made the time count and has equipped itself with a nice new chipset, a 1080p screen and a high-res 13MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Barring any major surprises in the near future, these welcome upgrades over the Note II, should be enough to turn the LG Optimus G Pro into the phablet to have come its market release in the next quarter. It simply won more of the rounds that count and unless LG makes another mess of its software update schedule might be one of the most successful devices by the company in recent times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Giving up the crown to a device that comes to the market some good eight or nine months later probably won't hurt the Galaxy Note II ego too badly. In fact, the Samsung flagship's morale will probably be boosted by the fact that there are still reasons (few as they might be) why people might choose it over a far newer device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of these reasons is the still unique S Pen pressure-sensitive operation, which adds a whole new dimension to the smartphone experience for the creative types and those who like to take lots of notes. There's also the better battery life, which is crucial to many power users and the better video recording quality. Finally, but certainly not least importantly, the Galaxy Note II has undergone several price cuts and will likely cost about ?150 less than the LG Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While those who want the latest and greatest technology will certainly find the premium price of the LG flagship easy to justify, the fact remains that the Galaxy Note II is still a stellar device that will serve its purpose well, while saving you a quite a few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as the two contenders part ways, each will have its own reason to celebrate. LG Optimus G Pro walks off with a promise to be the new king of the phablet realm, once it comes to the market (by May-June 2013). The Samsung Galaxy Note II, on the other hand, can rest assured that come the summer, it will still be a purchase no one is likely to regret, even eight or nine months into its product life.</paragraph>
