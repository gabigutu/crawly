			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today, we get to enjoy the company of the most junior representative of the Samsung's metal-clad A team - the Samsung Galaxy A3. Just like the Alpha smartphone, the A3 offers an aluminum frame, which highlights a lightweight design, built around a Super AMOLED display. And let us tell you, this baby does look as nice as it sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has been known for churning all-plastic smartphones across its entire portoflio. Pressured to evolve its product design, the company came up with the Galaxy Alpha, a super slim smartphone with an angular metal frame. But Samsung surely likes to spread its design concepts across the entire portfolio and thus the Galaxy A3 and the Galaxy A5 were born.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic panels didn't stop millions of users worldwide to choose Samsung's phones over the competitors. It's debatable whether that's due to Samsung's almost exclusive Super AMOLED screens, their R&amp;D hardware advancements or their aggressive approach towards adding new features to Android OS. It's a fact nonetheless. And as you can imagine, you can't go wrong with adding metal to their already winning recipe mix.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy A3 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's obvious that with a chipset like that, the Galaxy A3 won't top any performance charts. But it doesn't need to. It's a mid-ranger with a proper quad-core chip, an AMOLED screen and an adequate camera. And that about sums it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, it has a 64-bit processor and a microSD expansion slot, two things the original Galaxy Alpha is short on. Indeed, Android and its app ecosystem is yet to make proper use of 64-bit processors, but we're sure it's only a matter of time. And when the time comes, the Galaxy A3 will be able to benefit from any 64-bit optimizations that come up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Samsung Galaxy A3 is all unpacked and ready for a spin. We are definitely eager to check it out. Follow us after the jump for an in-depth hardware tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not like Samsung has never designed beautiful, metal phones. It's just that most of those came before the Android era. Samsung wasn't afraid to experiment with materials back then. Remember, the Samsung S8500 Wave?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, change is in the air and after the Galaxy Alpha and the Galaxy Note 4, Samsung is making the next step by re-imagining the design of its mid-range devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the phones in the Galaxy A lineup share the metal frame along the sides, which has beautifully machined, shiny metal edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy A3 features a 0.2" smaller display than the Alpha, which has resulted in the phone having an overall smaller footprint - 130 x 65.5 x 6.9 mm and 110 g. That's 2.3 mm shorter, 0.2mm thicker and 5g lighter than the original Galaxy Alpha. Here are few shots sizing up the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the white metal frame, the Galaxy A3 also uses metal as a trim to the camera lens, the loudspeaker, the power key and the volume rocker. The non-removable rear cover is made out of solid matte plastic with a smooth surface, which glistens as light falls on it. In fact this finish reminds us of how a pearl would glisten under light. The impression is so strong that it adds a sort of a feminine feel to the white smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, handling the Galaxy A3 is a real pleasure - the phone is impressively thin and light, the build quality is great and the matte rear cover provides a solid grip. The Galaxy A3 would easily fit even in a tight shirt pocket and it's so light that you may altogether forget that it's there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A key feature to the Samsung Galaxy A3 is its 4.5" Super AMOLED screen of qHD resolution. That's 540 x 960 pixels or 245ppi density. Such pixel density may not be of (what's known as) Retina grade (generally, above 320ppi), but it's OK for the market segment it would occupy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since this is a Super AMOLED unit, it delivers punchy colors, unmatched contrast and great viewing angles, and it's clearly legible outdoors. The Samsung Galaxy A3 also offers a number of screen presets to adjust the screen colors to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find an earpiece, the usual bunch of sensors and a high-resolution 5MP selfie snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing unusual below the screen either. A hardware Home key is flanked by a touch-sensitive App switcher key and a Back key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Alpha, the Galaxy A3 doesn't offer a finger-print sensor under the Home button, nor is there a heart-rate monitor on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal sides of the phone host a single hardware control each - the Power button on the right and the Volume rocker on the left. Both are made of metal. They are slightly too slim for our liking, as that makes pressing them harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD and nanoSIM trays are on the right-hand side, easily ejectable with the provided metal pin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast, the original Galaxy Alpha smartphone didn't offer a microSD storage expansion, but it did allow you to access and remove the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone features only the secondary microphone, which is used for ambient noise cancellation in calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is more crowded, accommodating the exposed 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port and the primary mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera is on the back, accompanied by a rather big LED flash. The camera itself protrudes slightly from the back of the phone, extending past the 6.9mm thickness. The snapper is also capable of recording 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of reach, below the back panel, is hidden a 1,900mAh battery. Unfortunately, it's not user accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we can't post sample images and videos from this one as the unit we have here is an early pre-production device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have to wait for a proper review unit until we measure the chipset performance, check the camera image quality and do the whole battery of tests we usually do in our full-featured reviews.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A3 comes loaded with wireless connectivity features. It starts with LTE Cat. 4 (up to 150Mpbs down, 50Mbps up), while regular 2G and 3G connectivity is, of course, supported, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Hotspot capabilities. There is no dual-band support, unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0 LE and ANT+, the latter aloowing for easier connection to certain wireless sports accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC rounds off the wireless connectivity section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A3 relies on a standard microUSB 2.0 port for charging and wired data connectivity. Having only 2.0 is fine as USB 3.0 ports are rare and require a fairly large female jack on the side of the phone - not the prettiest of sights on an ultra slim phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we do miss here is a wired TV-out option either via MHL or SlimPort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A3 also has a dual-SIM version, which sacrifices the microSD slot for a second nanoSIM tray. The Dual SIM Galaxy A3 will be available in two distinct regional flavors - a Samsung Galaxy A3 Duos with LTE and NFC connectivity and a Samsung Galaxy A3 Duos with only 3G support and no NFC.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Latest TouchWiz on Android 4.4.4 KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A3 runs on the latest available Android 4.4.4 KitKat enhanced with the TouchWiz UI. It's almost the same version that powers the Galaxy Alpha but with the fresh twist of supporting themes for the first time in the Galaxy lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen features the My Magazine tab, which displays both news articles and social networking updates. It's powered by the popular Flipboard app and you can enjoy your reads in a clean interface, and easily share links or post social updates straight from the homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are regular homescreens too, with shortcuts, widgets and folders. If you want just those, My Magazine can be disabled completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the first time ever, the TouchWiz UI now features Theme support. Quite expectedly, they change your default wallpaper, system icons, and system colors scheme. The themes however won't change the notification area or any apps or submenus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a way to install additional themes, but we believe that Galaxy Apps repo should add such option as soon as the feature launches officially.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is filled to the brim with features. The toggles work as usual and below them are two buttons (S Finder and Quick connect). Below that is the brightness slider, which can be hidden to save space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the app drawer, icons are presented as a customizable or alphabetized grid. You can also view only the ones you've downloaded yourself or just hide the ones you don't need. You can also disable some of the pre-installed apps so they won't take up any RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A3 has an App Switcher button below the screen, which, as you can guess, calls up a custom app switcher UI. As usual, you can go into the task manager for more advanced controls or just hit the Close all button from here, should you need that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz special features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A3 features Private mode. It secures your selected photos, voice recordings, music and other files with a code or password. Those files are only accessible when the Private mode is unlocked and are completely hidden from their respective apps otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this feature works separately from your lockscreen security feature. For instance, you can have the insecure Swipe to unlock lockscreen and still have your files PIN-protected with Private mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung offers two Power saving modes on its recent smartphones. Much as on the original Galaxy Alpha, those modes are particularly welcome on the Galaxy A3 with its smallish battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first mode restricts the chipset performance and background data and it can even turn the screen to greyscale for extra power saving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you really need to make those last few percent battery charge last, the Ultra power saving mode will conserve the available battery charge for as long as possible. This mode cuts off all advanced functions and even changes the homescreen to a simpler one with only six big shortcuts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has provided its own custom apps for the gallery and music player. The music player has SoundAlive presets plus a manual equalizer. It can automatically adjust the equalizer to your set of headphones with the Adapt Sound feature. It can also level out volume differences among the individual tracks with Smart volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FLAC audio playback is supported, too. There is FM radio support, too, you just need to open the FM radio app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Gallery shows photos by time and by album, though here "album" just means folder. One special trick that Samsung implemented is that you can filter images by person - the facial recognition software will group photos by the faces it manages to recognize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz gallery integrates your Facebook, Dropbox and Picasa albums so you can browse your online images as easily as local ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A3 seems to have gotten most of the things right. It is a proper midrange offer with solid specs and feature-rich software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A3 features the same premium design the Galaxy Alpha introduced, within a slim and lightweight body. And the captivating Super AMOLED screen sure boosts both the value and the looks of the smartphone. Of course, the battery could have been bigger, but that's the price you pay for such a slim profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Alpha was criticized because it didn't have a microSD slot and here we see the memory expansion option. If you don't care about more storage, teh Duos version of the phone will allow you to exchange it for a secondary SIM slot, while still keeping the LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we don't quite find adequate is the expected ?300 price tag. Of course, the price will only go down, once the device hits the shelves early next year, but for this amount of cash even Samsung has better phones to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if the Galaxy A lineup has got your fancy, but you'd like more screen real estate or better specs, you can check out the mid-range 5" Galaxy A5 (?400), the high-end 4.7" Galaxy Alpha (?500) or the soon to-be-announced 5.5" Galaxy A7. We're sure Samsung wouldn't mind whichever one you pick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy A5 ? Samsung Galaxy Alpha ? Samsung Galaxy A7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that about sums it up for now. As soon as we get a proper Galaxy A3 review unit, we'll put it through its paces to see how it really stacks against the competition. Stay tuned!</paragraph>
