			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 is one of the last smartphones by Nokia, putting an end to what has been a bumpy ride for the Finns in the modern phone era. Whether the Lumia line will find greener pastures under Microsoft remains to be seen, but one thing's for certain - the Lumia 625 will be one of Nokia's last Lumia releases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, the 625 certainly won't qualify as Nokia's loudest bang on its way out - that honor belongs to the Lumia 1020 flagship.Or, if we're lucky, a certain phablet may be the gadget to remember them by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the point though, the Lumia 625's main attention grabber is the healthy boost in screen size. By going from 3.8" to 4.7", the Lumia 625 gains almost a full inch in screen diagonal over its predecessor. This, along with LTE support, higher clock speed and full-HD video recording, highlights the primary advantages of the Nokia Lumia 625. For a more complete list of specs, you can refer to the following list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the larger screen and resulting larger dimensions, the Lumia 625 feels like a marked improvement over its predecessor. But bigger is not necessarily better, and the Lumia 625 may learn it the hard way. Big screen on a budget sure sounds nice, but WVGA on 4.7" could be too much of a stretch. And it's not a ClearBlack display either, which may as well be the only downgrade compared to the original Lumia 620 - along with the missing NFC chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No upgrade to the 512MB of RAM is potentially a minor disappointment, which can quickly be put to rest if the Lumia 625 behaves in our tests. The extra 700mAh of battery capacity is also a welcome addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next, we'll get started by unboxing the Lumia 625 and proceed with a closer look at the design and build quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package includes additional back cover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Nokia Lumia 625 is a pretty standard deal. Inside the moderately-sized box you'll find a USB cable, an A/C adapter for your particular region, and a headset. The charger has its own cord rather than relying on the provided USB cable like in most other retail packages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an added bonus, Nokia has thrown in an extra back cover - orange in our case, to complement the yellow one that the Lumia 625 came in.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 625 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 133.3 x 72.3 x 9.2mm and 159g, the Lumia 625 comes in larger and heavier than its younger 620 sibling, due to its larger display. One notable improvement is that Nokia was able to trim the phone's profile by almost 2mm, leading to a much more elegant and less bulky feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The removable back panel's only benefit is customization - the 2000 mAh battery is non-user-replaceable.The matte finish provides a surface that is very resistant to fingerprints, but still has enough texture so as to provide grip and not feel poorly made.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The replaceable back panel has the added benefit of covering not only the rear of the device, but also the sides, and is even visible from the front as a slim frame around the screen. This means that the back panel on the Lumia 625 does more than just cover the battery and internal slots - it defines it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned that the matte finish on the well-fitted plastic rear panel is almost impervious to fingerprints, but it also lends to a feeling of quality. The hardware buttons also come as part of the panel, so you don't have to worry about them being a different color when you want to change things up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides our yellow and orange, the Lumia 625 also has bright green, black, and white panels to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond that, the design strategy of the 625 is largely the same as what you'll find on most other Lumias: rectangular frame with tapered edges, for a subtly curved back. The display on the front also features gently tapered edges, which lend to the overall design aesthetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 625 is heavier than its predecessor by just over 30g, but by no means overly so. The added weight can not only be attributed to the larger display, but also to the hefty increase in battery capacity to 2000 mAh.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While you'll find AMOLED displays on high-end Nokia phones - the 925, 928, and 1020 to name a few - or LCD ClearBlack displays further down the ranks, the Lumia 625 has to make do with a garden variety LCD. It's an IPS unit nonetheless, and even one that's covered with Gorilla Glass 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display in question measures 4.7" and is of WVGA resolution (480 x 800) - the same as the 3.8-inch Lumia 625 - which results in a pixel density of just under 200ppi. While 200ppi is considered right around average by today's standards, they do tend to get stretched a little thin on such a large display. Here's how the pixels on the Lumia 625 stack up to the Lumia 620 under our microscope:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 has a setting that allows the user to choose one of eleven saturation levels, should the display appear too punchy for your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color temperature option is great too - it has 11 settings and goes from cool through neutral to warm. On LCD phones you're usually stuck with either a cool screen or a warm screen, depending on your preference it's either good or bad, it's a matter of luck hitting the right one. Having control over that takes chance out of the equation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of contrast, the contrast ratio provided by the Lumia is right around the middle of the road. We are content with the side viewing angles, but these are just average as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the sunlight legibility leaves much to be desired.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Nokia Lumia 625 uses the Super sensitive touch technology that debuted on the 920. It can respond to fingernails or car keys, and will detect touches even if you're wearing gloves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's requirements for a Windows Phone mean there's little variation in terms of controls across the product range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 is no exception. It has three capacitive keys below the display - Back, Home and Search. At the edge where glass meets frame is the microphone pinhole, while above the screen is the VGA front-facing camera, the ambient light and proximity sensors, and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is where all of the hardware buttons are. From top to bottom they include the volume rocker, the Power/Lock key, and the two-step camera shutter key. Like we mentioned, all the buttons come as part of the back panel, so they'll keep a uniform color should you choose to replace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device is bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key can be used to wake up the screen, but another way to unlock the Nokia Lumia 625 is to long press the shutter key. There's an option to either start the stock WP camera or Nokia's custom Smart Camera (which we'll cover later on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the phone hold the 3.5mm audio jack and USB port, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, you'll find the 5MP camera alongside an LED flash, and there's a speakerphone grille towards the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've covered the removable back panel in detail, so let's get into what's underneath. The 2000 mAh battery is sealed within the inner body and therefore non-user-replaceable, which is a bit of a downer considering the non-unibody design. To the right of the camera lens you'll find the microSIM and microSD card slots stacked on top of each another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2000 mAh unit inside is rated at for over 15 hours of talk time or 552h of stand-by in 3G networks, but if its endurance is not enough for you, you'll have to carry either an external juice pack or a battery case - both of which are pretty awkward and uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The complete test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tempered back and rounded edges along the sides of the Lumia 625 make handling the device a very pleasant experience, while the matte plastic provides very good grip, on top of being fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WP8 Amber on Lumia 625<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, Nokia has taken great care to add as much additional value to the Lumia Windows Phones as possible given the constraints imposed by Microsoft. And since Microsoft doesn't really allow UI customizations, adding value translates to supplying exclusive apps and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 comes with the Amber update preinstalled but that doesn't change the user experience dramatically. It does add a few features like FM radio support and a new camera lens (more on that in a minute) but the rest is barely different from the previous WP8 iterations. Oddly, the Lumia 625 doesn't come with the so-called Glance Screen available with the Amber update that shows the clock and some notifications, while the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications and images. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps to show less ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get an extra resize button, next to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it, too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking - well, not true multitasking, but more along the lines of iOS. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like Apple's iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (sat-nav apps, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kinds of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps behave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps, you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one, you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you keep on hitting the back key, you will effectively be closing all of the open apps one by one, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has confirmed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a WP8 handset, the Nokia Lumia 625 also supports voice commands - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Unfortunately, the Windows assistant is still far behind the competition as far as recognition speed and accuracy are concerned. Luckily Microsoft is working on Cortana virtual assistant that should premiere with WP8.1 in the US in early 2014 and the rest of the world in 44 languages before 2014 ends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 625 also comes with the Data Sense app, which shows you the amount of data you've used. Both cellular and Wi-Fi traffic is accounted for. There are different data limit types: one-time, monthly and unlimited. The first two accept custom bandwidth limit values, while the latter is applicable if you have an unlimited data plan, but would still like to track your usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data Sense can also restrict the background data usage for all apps, provided you're near the data limit that's been previously set. This will prevent some apps from functioning properly, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia Lumia 625 features the nicely helpful Kid's corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info relevant to their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 uses the Qualcomm MSM8930 chipset (1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 512MB RAM and Adreno 305 GPU). That's as good as it gets for the mid-range WP8 devices at this stage, though it is enough to give you a hiccups free performance. A good thing is, the WP8 platform doesn't feel sluggish at all. Navigation is fast and animations are nicely smooth and fluid. Loading times aren't always perfect, but are never too long to be an annoyance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is still awesome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to build the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" options. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many contacts and too many notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions: "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab has the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is great, but the ringer is quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 offered loud and clear in-call sound. Signal reception was problem-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The Phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 625 scored below average. The really quiet and there is a chance you miss some calls and notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (only the whole message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails as read/unread, flag and unflag, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with busy inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text does take some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up with the available actions and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos with uploads to SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos tab and Nokia Music with limited availability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio through the Nokia Music app ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2013, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board the Lumia 625, thanks to the Lumia Amber firmware. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna. To enable the loudspeaker playback, just tap and hold on the station and select the appropriate option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 audio output is hardly the best we have seen, but it's not too bad to make any difference to non-audiophiles either. The volume levels are average when connected to an active external amplifier and just above average when used with a pair of headphones, while the overall output is decently clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the active external amplifier part of the test the Lumia 625 managed mostly excellent scores, but the fairly high intermodulation distortion prevents us from giving it full points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones consists of a modest increase in stereo crosstalk, but it's certainly not the worst we have seen. Some extra distortion creeps in, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera does very good job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 boasts a 5 MP camera which is capable of taking pictures of up to 2592x1936 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and a couple of controls on the right. Those are the still/video camera toggle and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the shutter key will wake the phone up with and launch the camera app. The Lumia 520 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes it a couple of seconds before a photo is taken. This is a longer delay than we're used to from smartphones of late.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses are an interesting take at feature add-ons, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Cam lens, which is by far the most powerful, plus the Panorama, Cinemagraph and Glam Me lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Smart Cam uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode). You can also pick the best face and cycle through each facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 fares surprisingly well as far as image quality is concerned. The level of detail is great for the 5 MP league, while contrast, colors and dynamic range are pretty good, too. Noise is kept to a minimum and the little visible noise is of the luminance type, which is more acceptable as opposed to the chroma one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The close up mode or otherwise macro is great. The Lumia 625 can focus from a really close distance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder captures 1080p@30fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance and turn the continuous auto-focus on or off. You can use the LED flash as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 captures 1080p videos, which are pretty smooth, with lots of detail. Colors are accurate and contrast is good too. The continuous auto-focus sometimes is too sensitive though, but it's nice there is an option to turn it off. Unfortunately there is no touch focus option, you have to rely on the auto-focus for the video, and it sometimes fails when shooting close objects such as our Ferris Wheel for the video comparison tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bitrate is reasonable at 20 Mpbs and the framerate is firmly at 30 fps. The Lumia 625 captures only mono sound at 98 Kbps bitrate and 44 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSPA and tri-band 4G LTE connectivity. If you're in range of an LTE network, the 625 will do up to 100Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by (single-band) Wi-Fi b/g/n and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 625 lacks NFC support and that's why the Tap+Send function is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager (although a third party app is now in its beta testing stages) and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast Internet Explorer browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on the Lumia is the classic Windows Phone 8 deal, which has hardly changed with the minor update of the OS. The Lumia 625 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing and the ~200ppi pixel density is enough though you'll have to zoom in on some tiny fonts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer browser is great, though it's definitely not the fastest on the market.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 625 brings you to the Bing search app. It's the same app we used to see - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Local Scout now integrated into the places section of Nokia Maps, there are now two search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is the camera scanner, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The second is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the homepage-like additional Bing Search screen. It seems the Amber update removes this functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Windows Phone Store is growing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is higher than 175,000, and while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps on the other platforms are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 don't work on the older versions but all of the older apps are compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, or the windowsphone.com website, from where you can push apps to your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HERE Maps and HERE Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a high-end Lumia smartphone, the 625 gets the standard Drive navigation suite for free out of box. As usual its license covers a single country only. And since it's available offline you don't have to worry about roaming data charges, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most recent update to the HERE suite adds an overview of traffic conditions in your area, including your drive to and from work with the My Commute app. My Commute shows you an at-a-glance look at your specified commute with a special Live Tile on your homescreen. You can setup up multiple commutes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest release, the former Local Scout and City Lens features have been integrated into the Places section of HERE Maps, and gives you a quick view of restaurants, shops, galleries and other POIs around you, including an augmented reality view via the camera called LiveSight. Tapping the virtual signs in the camera interface pops up more info about the place, as well as directions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The best mobile office package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have no choice but to put aside the Microsoft deal, the value of stock and the aftershocks in our evaluation. Simply put, the Nokia Lumia 625 has the timing - but not the substance - of a swan song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, it would be a massive injustice to burden the phone with such responsibility. The Nokia Lumia 625 is a simple package with a simple purpose - to offer a big screen experience on a budget. And it delivers on that quite alright, with the usual give or take.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By sheer screen size, the Lumia 625 is well into - even beyond - flagship territory. Not even the 1020 can match the 4.7" diagonal. The screen quality is a completely different story - it's a garden variety LCD, which doesn't even use Nokia's ClearBlack tech. The screen is only average in all aspects, including the pixel density. The resolution is spread quite thin on that screen diagonal but the Windows Phone interface doesn't make this terribly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, if the Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8 got away with qHD on 5.8", which is even less pixels per inch, then the Nokia Lumia 625 isn't beyond redemption. We should note that a high contrast setting helps by making text more readable - the flipside is it disables some background images and you'll lose the solid color of the homescreen tiles. The screen itself has lively colors, though only average contrast and viewing angles. It also lacks Nokia's Glance Screen feature, but on the positive side it's a super sensitive display too that can even be used with gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft and Nokia have been consistently proving that Windows Phone 8 would run happily on what in Android terms is considered lower midrange hardware. The bad news for gamers is that many titles won't run on less than 1GB of RAM, so the Lumia 625 doesn't offer a mind-blowing gaming experience despite its big screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it's a well-built phone, which looks fresh thanks to those exchangeable battery covers. Its camera shoots very good pictures and video, and you get free life-time voice-guided navigation, be it for just a single country, which is the standard Nokia deal in the lower midrange. Arguably the best document editing on a phone and SkyDrive integration are things that may tip the scales the other way though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, phones like the Lumia 625 are all about the right balance between price and equipment. The Finns are not exactly keeping it a secret - the marketing of the 625 is riding on the big screen and affordability. At a little north of ?200, the Lumia 625 is targeting users who would go for the screen estate regardless of the compromise they'll need to make elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, a number of big-screened droids are worth checking out. The Samsung Galaxy Grand runs on a dual-core processor with Jelly Bean in charge, and boasts an 8MP camera with 1080p videos. There's dual-SIM support, but no LTE obviously. The Galaxy Grand is not shy in stretching the same WVGA resolution on an even bigger five-inch diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Grand I9082</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus F7 readily matches the LTE connectivity of the Lumia 625 and the screen diagonal. But trumps it with 720p resolution, as well as an 8MP still camera. This one however is probably going to cost a bit more though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus F7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.6" Sony Xperia SP has a 720p display too, and is powered by a more recent Snapdragon chipset with higher-clocked Krait cores. LTE, NFC, an 8MP camera and premium build are among its highlights and it's an overall package that's hard to beat - the usual solid job by Sony in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia SP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Lumia lineup, the 625 is the intersection of the 820 and the compact 620. It's kind of hard to speak of influences actually, considering the Lumia 625 has the biggest screen in the family, beating even the reigning flagship. Anyway, by going for the screen estate, you'd need to sacrifice the NFC support of the Lumia 620, the AMOLED screen and the 8MP Carl Zeiss-certified camera of the 820. And to be honest, the Lumia 720 is probably the best-looking option in the Finnish midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 820 ? Nokia Lumia 720 ? Nokia Lumia 620</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day though, we're talking a phone portfolio that will soon be Microsoft's to worry about. Screen size is what makes the Lumia 625 stand out without drawing all the attention to itself. It's just a regular squad member filing in a blank spot. But it could well be your kind of phone if you want all the screen real estate you can afford.</paragraph>
