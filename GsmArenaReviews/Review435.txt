			<paragraph>Now, we can introduce to you one of the most expected mobile phones lately, the music Alcatel OT S853. It has stereo speakers, supports Bluetooth and EDGE, ordinary headphones may be connected. This is an Alcatel, we may expect a good price/ performance ratio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After Alcatel had incorporated with the Chinese company TLC, they had gradually lost their influence in it. The new merged company introduced some new phones on stages. These however were stylish devices and mobiles of lower price and function classes. For the first time the fortune smiled on the most dedicated Alcatel fans in March this year on the CeBIT trade fair. The manufacturers didn't introduce smartphones or communicators as they had often promised before. The top mobile phone OT 853, however repaid the waiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Alcatel OT 853</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT 853 is a high to medium class mobile phone. I wouldn't put it in the highest category, though it is a step behind from the best. It offers sophisticated call functions, messaging functions and time organization. It's not low on data technologies. This is a music phone with top sound quality; it has no competition in playing through the built-in loud speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Juat a first look, the phone is still in development<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>According to the original plans, Alcatel OT S853 was to be released in September. They couldn't make it even for the Christmas sales and tchris he release date is still unknown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering that the sales have been delayed and the phone will be unavailable for at least two months, the model, which we had the chance to test, is not a final version. It's one of the early releases, with sufficient stability and full of functions. However it's early for final conclusions about its abilities and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This review is based on a pre-production prototype. That's why we will add further information just before sales start. We know, for example, that the Bluetooth performance will change, e-mail client or Push-to-talk have to appear. We don't expect that Alcatel would remove functions, so you may consider this article as a "basic version".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will be the price we may only speculate. It's for sure that Alcatel S853 won't be one of the overpriced phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>From the Matrix?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I think that technology fans will approve the phone. It has a dark matrix-like design and looks very durable at first sight. It slightly reminds of Siemens ME45. This is only a first sight impression however, the phone durability is typical and the massive edges only refresh the outer look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have already mentioned the shiny black surface, which literally acts as finger prints catcher on the CeBIT fair. Initially it seemed that the tested prototype is better. However reality is the same as the released phone. The front and back surfaces are both shiny and black. You have to clean it all the time in order to look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finger prints just stay</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side edge colors of the phone are different than the ones, presented on CeBIT. It's not with silver case, but black and from semi-rubber material. The phone looks better and doesn't slide in hands due to the surface modification. It will hit the market soon, so let's not judge the prototype before the final device comes out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Comparing the tested phone and the Alcatel, presented on the CeBIT</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to other phones, the OT S853 is rather big, but light. The proportions are 103 x 48 x 20 mm, and it weighs 94 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In hand</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The axial symmetry is for the uninspired<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dimensions of the display are 32 x 40 mm. However, this is nothing unusual, nowadays there are hundreds of phones with bigger displays. The resolution of 176 x 220 pixels and 262 thousand colors are good enough. The display is excellent, very clear. There aren't any visible borders between the separate pixels. The sun always wins, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The display in indoor conditions</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We may put the keyboard among the "special ones". The block with number buttons forms a square matrix. You'll have to spend some time on the section with the functional buttons until you can work with it. The main operation button, a four-way key with confirming centre, is on the left side, outside the phone axis. On the left and right sides of this block, we will find the functional keys with call buttons. The correction C button is again eccentrically located into the free space. I have struggled with it, pressing it instead of the function keys in the right upper corner. The operation, otherwise, is pleasant mostly for right-handers, as the thumb reaches just the main button. It won't be too hard for left-handers, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The keyboard is unusual, but comfortable (the lower buttons ate too close to one another)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The buttons themselves are made of solid plastic. When you press them, it's precise, definite and noiseless. The "2" key interferes with the round button, which may bother. The keyboard is a little bit unequally illuminated by blue diodes. It can be locked and unlocked by holding the asterisk, the traditional shortcut 159 also works</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display never fully goes off when keypad is locked</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's stereo and this can be felt<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel have put another six silver buttons on the left side of the phone. They are designed for operating the built-in music player and the camera. So, the user don't have to search the menu, can start or stop the player, skip over the pieces or adjust the volume by pressing the buttons in stand-by mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The set of music buttons on the phone's side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker connector is in the left lower corner, under a rubber blinding plug. More precisely, it's a short cable, finishing with remote control and 3,5 mm jack slot for separate headphones. We will talk about it later. The phone connector is different from the previous models. For example, you can't use the older external keyboard for fast writing with Alcatel OT S853.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capping strip for handsfree and connector</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a memory card slot, miniSD format, protected in the same way on the right side. We don't have information whether the card will be delivered in the standard package or about its capacity. On the right side, there is a strange ledge with the sign "Open" and everyone, who has had the phone in his hand, wanted to found out what it serves for. It's just how you can take off the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Memory card slot ? here you have to push with nail and take it up</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front and lower panels deserve more attention compared with other phones. In both of them, under effective grid, are mounted the speakers. Thanks to them Alcatel can play stereophonically. Above them is the infrared port, below, under the cover, the miniUSB connector for connecting the phone with PC. It may be used for charging as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  There is a speaker on every front panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the phone's back cover we'll find the camera lens and a self-portrait mirror. There is a Li-Ion battery of 810 mAh capacity under the cover. The indicated battery life is 330 h stand-by or 480 min talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Camera lens ? logo ? battery ? under the battery</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate graphic themes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The creation of good graphic background had always been a disadvantage of Alcatel. The manufacturer didn't use the potential of otherwise very good displays. The situation is a little bit better at OT 853 model, the user will appreciate the full resolution and the 262K colors only on a picture in the background. The background fully comes from the older models and we again meet the big square (legible, however) letters, big and square icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; The main display and the main menu are in two graphic themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feeling of disappointment lasts only until the moment we look into the graphic themes. In Alcatel they're traditionally named Atmospheres. Besides the background image, you may change another 7 parameters as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Different graphic themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All traditional data is on the main display. The functions, set to the left and right functional buttons, may be chosen from a list. Similarly you may set another functions (phone numbers, too) by holding longer selected number keys. Three functions, this time without possibility to be changed, are assigned to a single direction of the main button: phonebook, media album and SMS/MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another personalized option is the usage of the "My shortcuts" personal menu. The user can line up frequently used functions to a scale of 20 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User's menu settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is standard matrix. It has four rows and three columns. In the settings you may switch to an icon across the whole area. This scheme, however, is not very practical. The grid of icons is arranged better. In the other levels of the menu Alcatel uses its famous horizontal folders. You may choose from two letter sizes, the smaller ones are enough distinct, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Menu view in the form of big icons (you have already seen the matrix one)&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Small and bigger characters in second and other menu levels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I advise you to switch off the sound interface after switching the phone on for the first time. Otherwise the phone is going to play sounds when browsing the menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Where is the subwoofer?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the user background and the basic functions correspond to the older Alcatel models, the music functions are completely new, built-in radio and MP3 player (some Alcatel phones supported MP3 ringtones before).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT S853 doesn't have a connector for standard headphones. By default, it allows remote control on a cable, to which you may connect a common 3.5 mm jack. In case you are not satisfied with the added poor quality headphones, you may use anything with a jack in the end to listen on the Alcatel. The length of the cable would interfere, in such case add another meter to the headphones together with the remote control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Headphones with common 3.5 mm jack may be connected to the remote control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The buttons on the remote control copy the left phone's side, except the keys for camera activation, which are unnecessary. The remote control is fixed to your outfit through fasteners and also contains a microphone. The music is muted during incoming calls. Then it continues playing. You may work with the phone ordinarily while playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; The fasteners fix to your outfit</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the radio first. It uses FM range from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz. The tuning is manual, automatic or with directly set frequencies.. There are up to 20 positions for your favorite stations in the memory. The cable of the headphones is used like an antenna, RDS is not supported. The sound is relatively qualitative, the sensibility is sufficient. The Alcatel plays stereophonically in areas with good signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Radio on ? 3D sound settings ? volume</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were no perfect conditions for detailed MP3 player exploration. I don't have miniSD memory card, it's not widely used with phones, and not many pieces would get into the internal memory of about 10 MB. The tested phone didn't work with playlists and during the playing it showed the name of the album on the display, no other tags from the MP3 are showed. This still can be changed, let's not make definite judgments. The MP3 player quality is decent in this pre-final prototype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Memory capacity</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to music via the built-in speakers Alcatel OT S853 is better than any other modern music phone. The sound has enough basses, medium and high tones from the speakers, mounted on the both ends of the phone and due to the sufficient area. You may increase it through the 3D effect activation. The result, however, is very unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing I don't know is, what exactly does Alcatel mean by Stereo Surround 2.1. I get the Stereo, Surround also, I can see the two speakers, what about this one unit (1)? I just couldn't find Subwoofer in the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera still has a chance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have in our hands the first megapixel camera with the brand of Alcatel. I decided not to evaluate the picture quality so far. We'll see what Alcatel is going to think of in the next months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum camera resolution is 1280 x 1024 pixels. Another 7 resolutions are available, incl. the 640x360 panorama format. You may take pictures like photo camera or holding it horizontally. In this case, one of the buttons on the phone's side is used as a release button. You may control only the exposure compensation in the highest resolution, digital zoom is available only in lower resolutions. You can also record video in maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and up to 30 seconds length.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Vertical picture taking ? settings ? when taking pictures horizontally the display orientation is changed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures are stored in the gallery, from where you can view them. I didn't succeed to extend the image on the whole display, same with the video. What is more, in video mode there's no pause, not even a rewind option, just start/stop. There's no zoom option when viewing the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Gallery ? picture detail ? video detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures or video records can be sent via infrared port or MMS. Maybe it will work through cable, too. I didn't have the necessary software, though. The situation with the Bluetooth is even worse. The tested phone can use Bluetooth only for connecting to a handsfree. There will be an option to send data and use wireless internet connection in the market version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Searching by first character<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The whole shared memory is available in the Alcatel phonebook. The capacity is not limited to the number of entries. The phone uses folders, the first one contains contacts on the SIM card, the second one, the entire internal phonebook. the others are just contact groups. You can create them by yourself and assign a different ringtone for each one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Contact entering ? dialing ? Alcatel uses folders for viewing the calls &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Working with the folders is practical, Alcatel OT S853 however still uses searching by first character only. The phone of this class can't afford such thing in the year 2005. Even the interesting phonebook feature, to always find yourself back in the place where you have ended before, doesn't compensate for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Contacts on the SIM ? the main contacts (a contact with assigned picture) ? contact detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may assign up to 26 items to every contact. Besides the separate name and surname, seven numbers and e-mail address, there are also address, company, birth date (it's automatically added to the calendar), note and four lines personal information. You can't set a individual ringtone for the calling person, but you can assign a picture or even a video record, which is shown on the display at incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Incoming call of a person with picture assigned ? missed call</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound quality is excellent, both in the earphone and in the loud speakers. There is an option to record a call and the interesting thing is that the opposite side doesn't hear any alerting beeps. 64 polyphony or MP3 are ready to ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringtone profiles can be easily switched</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During call you can also go into the phonebook, messages, calendar and tasks or you may write down a text note. This option wasn't functional when testing the phone, but we can expect it from Alcatel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Email client would come, may be<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message functions are still a little mystery, especially the built-in e-mail client. The tested prototype already had the built-in client, which however hadn't been functional. According to the announcement, we may reckon with it in the final phone version, the same as the eventual Push-to-talk support in case of operators' interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Views of the e-mail client</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I can't commend Alcatel for the text messages so far. The editor in the prototype, that we have available, doesn't count the written characters and the number of the parts in which a long message will be divided, is shown just before the sending. Alcatel OT S853 uses T9 dictionary for fast writing. We had the opportunity to test English only. The editor is fast enough and uses well distinct characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Messages menu ? testing text message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel didn't gave in to its system for storing the incoming text messages yet. All messages are stored to the SIM card, from where you can delete or move them to the phone's archive. The archive is limited only to the shared memory. I know that such message system would suit some, but from the results of an enquiry we know that most of the users don't like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia messages are divided into two parts. The common MMS are in the first one. you may insert pictures, video and sound in them. Next here is Vox MMS, a function, which allows you to dictate something by voice and send the result without any fuss in MMS messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The alarm is either simple or can be repeated every day. Right next to it in the menu I can see time countdown. There is no stopwatch in the phone. You can be woken up by selected ringtone or by radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;View Extras ? alarm settings&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I don't have at disposal previous models in order to compare their functions with OT S853. However, I would say, that the calendar didn't change at all. There is daily, weekly and monthly view, in the other folder, a "to do list" (task manager). When entering new items you may choose between events, birthdays and calls. For birthdays, it's enough to enter a date and eventually to select a warning. The other two types of events require also time setting. The warning may sound directly in the time of the event or you can select it among 18 options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Daily, weekly and monthly calendar view ? to do list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may choose from common tasks to remind you that you have to call someone. There is an option to set priority, date and warning to the tasks. There are no text notes in the phone, but in regard to their availability during the call, we may presume that they would appear as a separate application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Appointment details ? reminder settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I believe that both the functions for time organization and the phonebook can be synchronized with a computer. We don't have at disposal any software to test so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is very simple, the currency converter, too. The tone recorder application is determined for recording "human" ringtones. Voice memo serves as a 30 sec. dictaphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Yes, it has EDGE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel is not very good at data transfers. The phone doesn't work in 3G network. However it's possible to use GPRS and EDGE, both Class 10. For now you may connect to internet from a PC via infrared port and we believe that Alcatel will also improve the Bluetooth until the beginning of the sales. We expect that the connection through the added USB cable would be possible as well. The built-in WAP browser works also with simple web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WAP browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were no games in the tested prototype. They had a separate folder in the main menu, so we can expect them. In addition, Alcatel supports Java MIDP 2.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Without conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tested Alcatel OT S853 was not final. Until the end of January, when the phone is going on sale, many things would change, so we're going to complement the review in the end. For example, the phone can still improve the full Bluetooth support or the e-mail client. We won't be angry in case Alcatel reconsiders the search method in the phonebook according to the first character and perhaps even the way text messages are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The success of Alcatel OT S853 depends also on the time, when it hits the market. The primary date has been already exceeded and the competition isn't sleeping. On CeBIT fair, we talked about a top and in most cases unequalled mobile phone. It was still rather competitive at the end of the summer, would it be able to compete in the first quarter of 2006?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT S853 is an excellent phone in any case. It is an unambiguous choice for the brand fans. They can't have anything better and the question is, whether they will ever have something better some day. In addition, Alcatel is planning an excellent price.</paragraph>
