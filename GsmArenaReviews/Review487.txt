			<paragraph>The new Nokia 3220 model has the functionality of a business phone. However, as it seems at first sight, it's meant for a different company. Priority is the original style, original light effects and the adaptation possibilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3220 is a Series 40 phone with classic construction. Its closest relative is the 3200 model. It's full of functions and it differs from "manager's stars" mainly by absence of Bluetooth and infrared port. Users will appreciate support of EDGE technology for fast data transfer, integrated email client, mobile Internet browser or hardware modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia 3220 design won't attract business people; it's designed for teenagers who would appreciate customizing possibilities by using paper covers, light effects, as well as the video recording digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is offered in five basic color variants. Two of them have a black base, other two have a white base and one has a red base. Each variant differs by the color of the decorative border and the area around the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All color variants together...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     ... and separately. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ugly kid<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When I first saw Nokia 3220, I got the feeling it's some new durable phone. Chubby forms, massive frame, embossed keypad - everything indicates so. The feeling is even stronger when you hold it in your hand and that's mainly because of the two lumps made of milk white rubber on both sides of the phone. It's an interesting design component with a hidden function that you'll uncover after you switch on the phone - color diodes will blink underneath them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Chubby forms attract at first sight ? the camera lense on the back side ? a bit different view... </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Few people will enjoy the new Nokia design at first sight. I personally liked the fussy combination of forms, materials and colors in couple of days. The phone features classical construction, enjoyable sizes of 104,5 x 44,2 x 18,7 mm and weight of only 86 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Blue switch key doesn't go together with any other fixed component of the phone ? loud speaker ? the phone is quite small</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The violet keypad and the display are bordered by a chrome rim, which is dominating the front part of the mobile. Inside the rim the cover is violet and bright. Over the display stands the producer's name. Outside of the rim the phone is covered with black plastic. You can see a small lucent window, encroaching on the upper part. It exudes the impression as it's an emergency lamp but its purpose is just esthetic. It continues on the lucent cover of the back part, whereunder you can place various paper pictures, as we already know from the previous Nokia 3200 mobile. Producer's logo decorates the back part of the mobile but the camera lense quite disturbs the impression; it's placed in a violet shiny scute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Fake lamp ? Nokia logo on the back cover ? back cover disassembly </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users could liven up phone design through paper covers. The papers enclosed in the package use the effect of picture changing when you look at them from a different angle of view. There is also a feature allowing you to make your own creations, e.g. editing an existing picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Replaceable paper covers are delivered with the phone; notice how the picture changes in different view angles </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone covers are replaceable, including the side lumps. Among the original accessories some day will be also a special back cover equipped with diodes, enabling the so-called wave messaging. This feature can display a short message (max. 15 characters) using the diodes so that you simply sweep the phone in the air. Human visual sense will perceive the light track as a message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Color covers for the wave messaging equipped phones</paragraph>
			<paragraph> It works like this: you sweep your mobile in the air and slowly reacting human eye will read the message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upper edge there is a blue long switch key and on the bottom there are Pop-Port and charger connectors. On both sides you'll find the already mentioned white lumps which make the phone fit well in the palm. The diodes, hidden under them, shine in two colors - green and red. The traditional side volume keys are not presented this time. Owing to the replaceable covers the phone is prone to creak at clasp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Upper switch key is used also for fast change of profiles ? the connectors on the bottom edge ? uncovered phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Let's go party; light effects are striking in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3220 is a triple-band phone (900/1800/1900 MHz) and the producer claims that battery should last up to 280 hours in a standby mode and up to 180 minutes of uninterrupted call. Nokia lasted maximum three days when I used all functions and switched it off at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Under the lid: battery ? SIM card and accumulator attachment ? wrist strap loop </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: nothing new<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Display sizes 27 x 27 mm and features resolution of 128 x 128 pixels; these parameters are well known e.g. from the 6230 model. It's active, can display up to 65k colors and its capabilities are good; but still can't keep pace with its Asian rivals. It could be a bit bigger but smaller display area brings the advantage of energy saving. What surprised me the most was the excellent readability even on the direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display is square ? raster is soft and colors are accurate </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad: what is that under my finger?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keypad looks quite shaky at first sight. That impression is caused mainly by the used material, which is soft rubber, and the fact that the keypad is standing out of the surrounding space that evokes a feeling of high lift. However, keys click very soon - it's a quite loud click that can be disturbing sometimes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad raise confuses at first ? navigation key has a big clearance ? * keypad stands up high of the surrounding spaceu </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys of the numeric keypad are connected in parts to blocks and separated distinctly, therefore they are well recognizable. The same solution is used also for the selection keys, which are paired with the red and the green key. In the middle there is a square five-directional navigation key. Its control is quite comfy but sometimes, when you wish to confirm it goes to some direction. However, that's more a matter of habit. Keypad illumination is white, regular and sufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NPerhaps it doesn't look so on the picture but the illumination is really good. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Environment and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Display in standby mode displays a signal strength indicator on the left side and a battery capacity indicator on the right. You won't be short of time, operator name and profile (if other than Normal is set) information and descriptive text of the soft keys, which is really tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display in standby mode without the background ? with the background ? active animated saver</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left soft key is set for entering the ten most used functions, while the right one runs the menu to work with the contact list. You can enter the contact list quickly by pressing the down arrow (navigation key), while pressing the up arrow opens a standard photo menu. Pressing the left arrow opens the Create message menu and the right arrow starts the Calendar menu. By selecting the confirmation key, you'll enter the main menu. Main menu can be displayed in large icons (then you have only one icon on the display) or in matrix of nine icons. Icons are drawn very simply, only in shades of grey and colors of a chosen style. Especially in the matrix mode it seems a bit archaic against the refined animations of the competitors. Going through the menu works very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Menu in the matrix form ? nowadays better drawn icons are used ? it's possible to assign different functions to the soft keys </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors of the menu can be changed in eight different shades. Besides color presentation, the wallpaper in the menu background is also changeable. In standby mode every picture can be displayed on the screen. You should just keep in mind that texts on the display can be only in black and a dark background would make them almost invisible. Color schemes, together with wallpaper, display saver and selected ringing tones can be set in accordance with defined themes. Seven of them at your disposal in the phone, more can be downloaded from the Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Color themes have different menu backgrounds</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 2.5 MB of shared memory available for all multimedia data; Nokia 3220 unfortunately doesn't support extension cards. Data is stored in respective files and sorted into folders. Simple file manager makes it possible to control all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sample of installed themes ? file browser with large icons... ? ...and as a list with small icons ikonami </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contact list and calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For speed dialing users can use voice dial (10 records maximum) or hold 2-9 keys, which can be assigned to any number from the contact list. In the contact list you can write down mobile, home, office phone and fax number for every name. A number, which is set as default, will be dialed directly from the contact list; you can get the rest by displaying name details. Besides numbers, you can add also an e-mail, web and postal address to every contact. You can also save a text note in length up to 60 characters and an image for certain name that will be displayed during ringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact list view ? searching in the list ? contact details ? sorting the groups</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort the contacts into five groups, which can be assigned with a special ringing tone and image. It's possible to search the list by entering up to 8 characters and the phone can display the contact list on the SIM card and in the phone memory together or separately. The Nokia 3220 mobile phone can ring out a sixteen-voice melody with quality playback or a record in AMR format. Sounds can be supplemented with light effects by the diodes on both phone sides and vibrations. The display illumination is also blinking simultaneously, which is quite unpleasant if you would like to read who is calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are able to control the volume during a call by using the left and the right arrow navigation keys. Surely you would appreciate a loud handsfree that plays the sound in a high quality and loud enough. Of course the phone is not short of ringing profiles. There are six of them available and they are timed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Writing SMS and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports SMS, MMS and the so-called flash messages. These are special text messages that can be only 50 characters long and the received message appears straight on the phone display. And as usual by Nokia, it supports Smart messaging instead of EMS. T9 dictionary can be a good helper by writing SMS. Another pleasant feature is fast smile insertion from the menu, which you can open by double-pressing the star key. The phone keeps you informed about remaining number of characters and the number of SMS written. It's also possible to send a message to more recipients at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    With small font you'll see entire SMS on the display ? easy insertion of smiles ? useful feature - message counter </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose from two different fonts in the message setting menu: with smaller font eight rows fit on the display, with bigger - only five rows. You can store up to fifty messages in the phone. There is also a useful feature called Message counter, which counts sent and received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Working with the MMS editor is very easy. It's possible to page messages, insert up to thousand characters to every page and add a picture and a sound clip. Unfortunately, the editor doesn't display final result; it only inserts a text link instead of a picture or a sound. To view the final MMS before sending it, you should select Preview from the menu. Size limit for one MMS message is 100 kB. It's possible to save fifteen of them in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Inserted pictures are not displayed during creating an MMS... ? ...this is possible with the Preview function</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated email client is in fact a Java application, but common users wouldn't notice that. It supports POP3 and IMAP4 servers and is very simple. The client can't work with attachments, neither download only headers of emails. Well, it's sufficient for easy email operation. You can use Instant messaging with Nokia 3220 also.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Integrated email client </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can schedule your time by using the Calendar. It's the same as in other Nokia Series 40 phones. By default it's presented in a monthly view but can be displayed also in a weekly view or as a task list for a given day. It's possible to choose beginning of the week: Monday, Sunday or Saturday. In monthly view days with recorded event are highlighted in bold font, in weekly view the events are displayed in relevant day and time as icons according to an event type. The phone offers you five of these: meeting, call, birthday, memo and reminder. You'll be warned of the event only by one type of sound signal with a show of lights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Montly view in the calendar ? weekly view ? list of daily events ? records menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another traditional feature is the To-do list. There you can enter notes with maximal length of 160 characters. You can assign a priority to single tasks but you will never be warned of them. It's possible to transfer the tasks simply to the Calendar. It works also contrariwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> List of tasks with assigned priority ? view on a task record</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course an alarm clock can't miss. It can wake you up with any melody you want and it's satisfying that it's possible to set a repetition. You can add a note that can be long up to three thousand characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alarm clock setting ? notes font is small only </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What next?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated calculator is very simple. It ignores priorities of the mathematical operations; on the other hand it can calculate the square and the square root and converts currency values.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator ? you can find the square and the square root among the functions ? currency converter is also integrated in the calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore you'll find a voice recorder, which can record pieces of speech, sound or an active call up to a length limited by the memory. Records are saved in AMR format and it's possible to send them via MMS or use them as a ringing tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some other functions, such as a countdown timer, a stopwatch or a wallet - feature popular among Nokia users. Wallet allows users to keep secret information - e.g. PIN codes - under one password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Voice recorder ? stopwatch can also measure an intermediate time ? Wallet application  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone of this type can't be short of the games. Five of them are waiting for you:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Water Rapids: Your task is to go downstream on a raft. There are six wild rivers to go through. To go to the next river, you must reach the end of the previous one. For passing the rapids and waterfalls you gain points that you can also loose if you turn over you raft or touch a dry land. I find this game most interesting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adventure Race: This is a race, consisting of four disciplines: mountain bike riding, run, kayak riding and orienteering. Riding a bike bored me quite quickly, same as the run. Kayak riding is more amusing. Orienteering is more like a logical game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phantom Spider: Action shooting game with a view from above. You're a pilot of a flying spider and your mission is to fight against the army of evil tarantula. You'll enjoy the game if you like spiders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Club Pinball: The name itself suggests that this is a classic Pinball game. The game is well made, with nice graphical environment and it'll bring you a lot of fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dance DeLight: A figure is dancing on the screen whilst line of balls is displayed below the figure counterclockwise. Your task is to remember the number and the color of every ball in correct order. Perhaps you'll exercise your memory but this game will get you bored soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Games menu ? Water Rapids ? Adventure Race ?Phantom Spider ? Club Pinball ? Dance DeLight  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can load the phone with more Java games or applications, it supports Java version 2.0. More than one megabyte of memory is available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Too vivid photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated VGA camera makes pictures of average quality. They have a soft color shade, mostly green, which is to a large degree seen in the picture corners. Four modes for picture taking are available: standard photo, portrait, night mode and video. It's always possible to choose from 3 different image qualities. The self- timer at Nokia 3220 is supplemented by light effects. At the camera window there is no mirror this time so you have to manage it in a different way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera lens is protected by a lucent cover ? after cover removal</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewfinder ? mode selection ? picture quality is set in three levels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are stored into a defined folder in the shared memory. You can use several features for editing the images: insert text, insert border, clip-art or crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Picture view ? list of pictures in the gallery ? picture editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Various scenes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Quality from highest to lowest level </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;night mode ? portrait</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video mode it is possible to make records (with sounds) in length limited only by the size of the shared memory. 3GP records quality is not high but enough for an MMS.</paragraph>
