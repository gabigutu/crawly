			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design and software experience coming straight from the most successful droid of all times, packed in a shell that's far easier to pocket. Now, who wouldn't want some of that? The Samsung Galaxy S III mini is the company's most premium compact Android smartphone and is here to prove that you don't need to come close to phablet territory to get the latest and greatest from the world's largest smartphone manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, going through the shrink ray has had some not quite so pleasant side-effects. The Galaxy S III mini comes with half the number of CPU cores and just 41% of its resolution. Will those two balance out with the smaller screen and still get you the high-end experience? We'll only know for sure when we are done with the review, but here's the quick rundown of the Galaxy S III mini key strengths and weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean isn't the most common sight in the Android mid-range, and coupled with Samsung's home-brewed Nature UX and its cool software tricks goes some way towards justifying the higher price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera might be an obvious downgrade over the full-sized Galaxy S III but, luckily for the mini, it doesn't have to compete with the same kind of top-notch sharpshooters as its bigger brother. We'll have to see how it performs in real life scenarios, before passing the judgment, but the Galaxy S III mini certainly isn?t too badly prepared here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's stop with the speculations and get down to testing. The unboxing, followed by the hardware inspection await you on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package as basic as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes in rather standard retail package, with the usual set of accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a charger and a USB cable for tethering your Galaxy S III mini to your computer and a headset. The charger has its own wiring and doesn't need the USB cable, so you can keep one at home and the other at your office.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini measures 121.6 x 63 x 9.9 mm, which is just about the size of the original Galaxy S. The mini is certainly way more compact than the current Samsung flagship, but its form factor is nothing out of this world. What we mean is you get 34% less screen in 26% less front surface - not exactly an engineering masterstroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini is a tad larger in every direction than a Motorola RAZR M, which fits a bigger 4.3" screen and a beefier 2000 mAh battery, so Samsung could have used the available space better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind though, that the Samsung smartphone has hardware keys, whereas the Motorola handset relies solely on on-screen navigation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini looks exactly the way its name suggests. After the Galaxy Note II showed us what the Galaxy S III would've looked like if it ate all its vegetables, we now have the flagship's little brother, who took a career in weightlifting. Shorter and stockier than the original, the Galaxy S III mini is a pretty nice looking mid-range smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we did have our reservations about the Samsung Galaxy S III all plastic construction, its design is one that grows on you. What's more, the Galaxy S III mini is not facing the same kind of elite competition as its bigger sibling, so its looks might actually be an advantage. There aren't any polycarbonate bodies to be had in the Android mid-range, so some high-quality plastic is quite welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of the Galaxy S III mini's controls is similar to that of the Galaxy S III, but there are a few notable hardware omissions such as the ambient light sensor and a secondary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bellow the display you get the same three keys - capacitive Menu and Back buttons and a regular press Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as the proximity sensor. There's also a VGA front-facing camera for video-calls here, but no ambient light sensor, which means that automatic brightness control is a no-go on the Galaxy S III mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung I88190 Galaxy S III is where the volume rocker is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side there's only a power key. Since the original Galaxy S III lacked a dedicated camera key, it would be foolish to expect one here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is at the top of the Samsung Galaxy S III mini. There's no secondary microphone here, as there's no active noise cancellation or stereo sound recording in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port sits alongside the primary microphone at the bottom and is used for both data connections and charging. USB host and MHL are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini is where the 5 megapixel camera lens is located. It has the LED flash and the loudspeaker grille on its sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1500 mAh battery. Bellow it are the microSD card slot and the SIM slot, which takes regular size SIMs. The memory card slot is located below the battery, so hot-swapping is not an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini managed a pretty respectable 42h endurance rating in our dedicated battery test. It's not quite as good as the 50h score of the Galaxy S III after the Jelly Bean update, but the mini will still easily last you for a day. Even two if you aren't too heavy an user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The complete test is to be found here. You can find more about what we test and how over here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini uses a 4" Super AMOLED screen of WVGA resolution (800 x 480 pixels). It's identical to the screens used in the original Samsung I9000 Galaxy S and the Galaxy S Advance and the image quality is about the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density clocks in at 233 ppi, but since the AMOLEDs of that generation use a PenTile matrix, you can spot the familiar dottiness. It's not a big deal, but it's one of those things that once you spot, you can't get out of your head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Galaxy S III display offers more than decent image quality for a mid-range device. Colors a punchy, blacks are as deep as on other AMOLEDs and the viewing angles are extremely wide. There's some color shift when looking from an extreme angle, but the screen remains perfectly legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is also quite good, as testified by the Galaxy S III mini performance in our dedicated test.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini is really easy to handle with its curved back fitting nicely in the palm of your hand. Single-handed operation is also always an option - one of the few areas, where the Galaxy S III mini beats the original Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nature UX in smaller form factor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and the latest TouchWiz launcher, dubbed Nature UX. It's the premium combination that we saw on the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II and it undoubtedly boosts the user experience compared to stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it handles on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" affair and there're ripples accompanied by water-drop sound as you drag your finger. Samsung has provided three customizable shortcuts (down from five on the big S III) at the bottom of the screen - drag one up to activate the specific app. In case of missed calls or incoming messages for example you can drag to unlock the device and directly launch the call log or the messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one always opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other four to any shortcut you like or even a folder full of shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Bluetooth and you can swipe to the side to get even more - Mobile data, Blocking mode, Power saving and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the brightness slider (there's no automatic brightness toggle here, though). There are also a couple of other useful things here like the Settings shortcut in the upper right corner, the time/day-of-week/date display to its left and the carrier name at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This being Jelly Bean, you get expandable notifications to get more info about them. You can expand and collapse them with a two-finger swipe and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer houses both app shortcuts and widgets . Unlike stock Android, you cannot move between tabs by swiping through the pages - you have to explicitly hit the widgets tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets takes some getting used to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes - Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid (if you think you can find apps quicker when they're ordered alphabetically) and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean comes with various widgets and Samsung have added even more. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is now available natively in Jelly Bean. Widgets automatically move out of the way when you're reorganizing the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Jelly Bean-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three buttons at the bottom of the list - one to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager, one to launch Google Now and a Kill all apps button. This is the quickest way to clear up both the list and some RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX dressing on top of Android 4.1 looks great and the Galaxy S III mini does pack most of the cool software tricks of its bigger brother. It's rare to see a compact device having most of the bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And despite the lack of a quad-core chipset, the Galaxy S III mini handles the heavy Samsung skin equally well. It didn't even experience that much difficulties with a heavy live wallpaper.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung released S Voice as an answer to Siri before Google came out with its own solution in Google Now. S Voice is the culmination of Samsung's ongoing effort at integrating voice commands into the Android experience, an effort which goes back to the days of Vlingo. You may remember the voice activation (saying "Hi Galaxy" to trigger S Voice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can do the usual - search the web, make calls, send texts (which Android natively supports and so does Vlingo), but you can also use it instead of the notification area toggles, answer or reject incoming calls, start the camera and take a photo, control the music player and FM radio and stop or snooze alarms all with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also a tool for quickly looking up facts - it's powered by Wolfram Alpha (which handles some of Siri's answers too). It has an enormous database covering topics ranging from Culture and Media to Physics. S Voice can also be used as a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has decided to keep S Voice alongside Google's solution as the two do differ in functionality. Jelly Bean has the unspoken Google Now info cards, but it also brought Google's Knowledge Graph, which can answer factual questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Since the latest update came, Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini doesn't use an Exynos chipset or a Snapdragon S4 like the big S III. Instead it has a NovaThor U8500 chipset with two Cortex-A9 cores at 1GHz, 1GB of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The older CPU design and relatively low clock speed keep the S III mini from advancing too much when it comes to single-threaded performance (indicated by Benchmark Pi).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant scales better and while the Galaxy S III mini is no match for the quad-core flagships, it does well for itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NovaThor uses a lower-end configuration of Mali-400 compared to Exynos, so the S III mini lags behind the S II in NenaMark 2 even though they are competing at equal resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't really have the oomph to render 720p either. Not that it has the display for it, but high-end 3D games might not run all that smoothly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.1 Egypt (720p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to JavaScript performance, Jelly Bean has plenty of optimizations and the Galaxy S III mini keeps up with higher-end dual-cores in SunSpider. The mini isn't too far behind the quad-core Galaxy S III in BrowserMark 2, which scored pretty low on this test. Some optimizations to the software might improve things.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has room for everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. There are four tabs on top accommodating the Phone app, Groups, Favorites and Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text message (left swipe).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap on the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all available details, and now shows two tabs instead of four. The first one is the About tab, which shows the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there're a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has even added a built-in reject list. It acts like a third party blacklist app and blocks the numbers on it from calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature lets you choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes any unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from those sources as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Samsung Galaxy S III Mini is really good with crisp and loud sound. Reception was also problem-free and we didn't suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would occasionally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature that the Samsung Galaxy S III mini offers is Direct Call, which lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. Smart alert will vibrate the phone when you pick it up, if there are any missed calls or messages. You can, of course, use the old flip to mute gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy S III mini. It scored an overall mark of Average, which means you might consider enabling vibration in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Big messaging features on the small screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box grows as much as it needs to - it can fill the entire screen (above the on-screen keyboard that is), growing to 10 lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule a message to be sent automatically at a later point in time. There's a list of all scheduled messages in case you need to cancel or send a message ahead of time manually. You can also mark certain numbers as "spam", in case some automatic promo texts get pushy, and lock messages to prevent their deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox. Another cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a synch schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, gesture and voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with several text input options. You have the traditional QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode (which is a little cramped) and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right to switch between letters and symbols or you can enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like swiping your finger around but Continuous input isn't to your taste, you can try using the handwriting recognition. It's quite accurate but the 4" screen is not ideal for it, especially if you have big fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and since the S III mini is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phone is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock gallery with a pinch of TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with the default Jelly Bean Gallery, which as you'd imagine has been treated to some TouchWiz flavor. It opens up in Albums view, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the bottom of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, as well as customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy S III mini will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize who is who automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with SoundAlive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini utilizes the same TouchWiz-clad music player, as its bigger brother, the Galaxy S III. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. The company also uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories, but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've enabled the Motion gestures, you can mute and pause a track by placing the phone face down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video player gets slightly demoted<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has put what is easily the best default video player on the Samsung Galaxy S III mini. It offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view shows static video thumbnails (unlike the mini's more powerful siblings, which animate the thumbnails).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the S III mini does feature Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can pinch-zoom the video to adjust its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three view modes for how the video fits the screen (fit to screen, fill screen, 100% resolution). The SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's video player typically has extensive codec support, though the lower-power chipset on the S III mini has led to some limitations. It can play AVI (XviD), MP4 and WMV files up to 720p resolution. DivX doesn't work though, MKV files are not recognized and DTS and AC3 audio won't play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the screen - you can adjust video brightness, Auto play next, play speed, SoundAlive and enable subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini made a good impression when it offered us a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini audio output isn't as good as that of its bigger brother. However, that doesn't mean that it's bad - in fact when connected to an active external amplifier the smartphone got excellent scores all over the field, with no weak points whatsoever. Volume levels were about as good as on the full-sized S III, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play the distortion levels rise a bit and the stereo crosstalk spikes, but the rest of the readings remain pretty good. The volume levels are just average, but the overall performance is pretty solid, particularly for a mid-range device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with a 5MP camera and is able to capture photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. It has an LED flash to assist it in low lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on the Galaxy S III. On the right there's the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - you can easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth shortcut always points to Settings. You can also move the icons around to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S III mini has an extensive set of features: touch focus, smile shot, continuous shot, panorama mode and can snap photos during video recording (but at only 720p resolution, basically a frame from the video). What's missing is an HDR function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual images are among the better we've seen from a 5MP snapper. The photos have some noise in them, but the noise reduction isn't too aggressive and the fine detail is mostly intact. Colors are fairly accurate (with the traditional slight oversaturation) and the dynamic range is good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video capture is good too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface of the Galaxy S III mini is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left with five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is okay but not perfect - there are no noise or compression artifacts, though there's noticeable jaggies on diagonal lines and oversharpening halos. Still, videos are smooth and better than most other 720p-capable mid-rangers we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot at 720p @ 30fps and are stored in MP4 files with 12Mbps overall bitrate and mono sound at around 120Kbps / 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini has a long list of connectivity features. Let's start off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (AWS is missing though). The 3G connectivity is backed by HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE, which incorporates Bluetooth 3.0, but also includes the efficient Low Energy mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some regions the S III mini has NFC connectivity. It lets you share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. You'd need two S Beam-enabled devices to get this to work - while not many models support it, there are plenty of Galaxy S III's around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share with other NFC devices as well, but the functionality is limited to what is provided by Android Beam - Android's stock NFC tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaked Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini has the Jelly Bean version of the Android browser, which has been tweaked by Samsung, but Chrome came pre-installed too, if you prefer it instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the default browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One advantage over the regular browser over Chrome is plug-in support, more specifically Flash. Of course it doesn't come pre-installed (Flash isn't officially supported on Jelly Bean), but you can grab the APK for ICS (here's the archives page at Adobe that holds all past versions) and it will work.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with a number of cool apps preinstalled. The one glaring omission is the Office document editor - perhaps Samsung finally came to terms with the sheer amount of free office editors available on the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is easy to use with your fingers. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, moth, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled their new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Premier. It can sync contacts, calendar and S memos and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app features five tabs, each with a different function. The first tab lets you create multiple alarms (each with a distinct repeat time and ring tone), then there are the World clock, stopwatch, timer and desk clock tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the Premier horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app lets you browse all the files in your phones' memory or on an attached microSD card. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone, an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III mini comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy S III mini has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Still, keep in mind that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Is the Samsung I8190 a shrunk-down Galaxy S III? It vastly depends on your understanding of a mini version, but we believe that it isn't. It's more of a Galaxy S Advance repackaged in an Galaxy S III-styled body and with a tad extra RAM. It's not a bad phone, it's just not what we expected to get. And certainly not at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a pity because the start was promising - 4" is a perfect balance between portability and functionality for moderately heavy users, who don't want to carry a mini-tablet in their pockets. A proper RGB matrix on the Super AMOLED screen would have been appreciated though or at least a higher pixel density - the Galaxy S III mini aims to be an upper mid-range phone after all and you can actually find HD screens for less than it costs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, under the right circumstances the Galaxy S III mini makes sense - processing power is enough for everything but the heavy games (which work better on the larger screens anyway), Android 4.1 Jelly Bean is great to have and there's sufficient storage and you can easily (and cheaply) expand it. Even the design seems to work better on the mini than it used to on the full scale Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big problem with the Galaxy S III mini is that it's a mid-range phone and bang-for-buck is key in that market segment.. Yes, the mini is cheaper than the big Galaxy S III, but that one offers double of almost everything, so comparing them is anything but fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart money is on the Galaxy S Advance, however, as it is virtually the same phone as the S III mini (though it doesn't look nearly as well) and is noticeably cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting alternative is provided by the former Samsung flagship - the Galaxy S II. Packing a larger AMOLED screen and a full RGB matrix that one can actually beat the Galaxy S III mini in terms of processing power and is on course for getting Jelly Bean in the next month or two. The Galaxy S II also offers a superior camera with 1080p video recording and more storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The catch is that while 4.1 Jelly Bean is bound to be the end of the road for the Galaxy S II, it's only the start for the S III mini. Samsung has been doing pretty well with the updates of its devices lately, so the mini is likely to get at least one or two major update in its life cycle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance ? Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to other brands - the Sony Xperia P has the same chipset, but sharper screen, higher-res still camera and a cool aluminum unibody (but no microSD card slot). The HTC Desire X does have a microSD card slot but its chipset is slightly slower and it can't record 720p video. Still, both are at the same price point, below the Galaxy S III mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia P ? HTC Desire X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, if the S III mini's price is acceptable, you can go for the Sony Xperia S, which costs the same, but has a 342ppi screen, a 12MP camera with 1080p video capture and 32GB (non-expandable) storage. Or how does a quad-core CPU sound? Because the LG Optimus 4X HD is not that much more expensive than the mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia S ? LG Optimus 4X HD P880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chances of the Samsung Galaxy S III mini don't look too great, but there might be a place in the company's Android lineup for a device like this after all. With the Premier, Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II forming the top of the food chain, the diminutive droid gets to ride on the strong brand image, which is a pretty potent weapon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, Samsung has done a good job of optimizing the hardware and its latest custom launcher Nature UX is arguably the most functional on the market. The price is too ambitious at the moment, but it should come down quite quickly at which point the Galaxy S III mini will be a great mid-ranger to buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until then, though, it will remain a niche device for people who love the Galaxy S III design language, but can't pocket the full-size version of the flagship.</paragraph>
