			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is back for a second round and this time it will stay a while longer. The company?s new flagship did great in our preview and we?d gladly have more of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The statement just couldn?t have been stronger and clearer. The new BRAVIA screen and the impressively slim and fit body are exactly the way to treat a flagship. Android Gingerbread too is as good as it gets in the smartphone world these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just months ago that combination would?ve equaled a license to kill ? which the Arc would?ve used without second thoughts. But the competition is insanely intense today and no one is given a second to think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes more than a few outstanding features these days, and they?d better be backed by solid performance across the board. Omissions are not easily forgiven so the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc better stay focused.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is a sweeping update of the X10. A new generation chipset, more screen estate and a microHDMI port in a well done facelift make the Arc an easy pick even over a Gingerbread-powered XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in-house competition is by far not the XPERIA Arc?s biggest problem. Competitors have moved so much forward over the past year or so that the question really is whether Sony Ericsson have managed to keep the pace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG and Samsung have already gone dual-core and got Full HD video recording, while Sony Ericsson ? and HTC ? are so far choosing to focus their efforts elsewhere. This review should help us answer ? among other things ? the question of who made the right call and who will have to play catch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the unboxing right after the break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 20 July: Following the introduction of the new deeper Facebook integration on the Xperia Arc, we revisited this review and we've added all the details. We've dedicated a new page to it, so if you're interested, you can jump straight ahead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package a cable short of perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself as well as a few standard-issue accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for charging and computer connections) and a set of earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A socket charger is included too which is to be used with the microUSB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are a couple of user guides and an 8GB microSD card in the box. The only thing missing is an HDMI cable ? microHDMI to HDMI ones aren?t so widespread and you might not have one at home. And for the price you pay for the Arc, Sony Ericsson could have saved you the effort (and extra cash) of getting one yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 04 April: Of course, the contents of the box are strictly market dependent and as many of you pointed out the Arc does come with an HDMI cable in some regions. And some are also getting a 16GB microSD card and even a carrying case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc measures 125 x 63 x 8.7 mm, which is pretty good for a smartphone with a 4.2-inch screen. We?ve seen thinner screen bezels, but the waistlines don?t usually get much slimmer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you should keep in mind that those 8.7mm are measured at the handset?s slimmest part ? in the middle. At the top and bottom the Arc thickens up to 10mm, but that?s not too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc weighs in at the remarkably low 117 grams. It has none of the muscular clout of some metal-clad smartphones but is no less impressive with the sophisticated elegance of a subtly curved super slim body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design is one of the Arc?s key assets. The slim, inward curved back carries a high-tech vibe that we really appreciate and we do find the gradient color finish at the back quite attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the glossy materials are easily covered in smudges and the phone quickly loses its appeal. Your Arc will require daily care to keep its great looks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reality display is pretty good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.2? 16M-color LCD screen of the XPERIA Arc has FWVGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels). It?s a capacitive touchscreen and we had no issues with its sensitivity and response. As you would expect from a modern day smartphone, multi-touch input is enabled too so as far as touch control is concerned, there?s nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dubbed Reality display, the most interesting thing about the the Arc?s screen, is the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine, which is expected to improve the image quality by boosting contrast and sharpness when viewing images or watching videos. We are pleased to report that it?s actually doing a good job, rather than just sound good in a press release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, when looked at from the proper angle the XPERIA Arc display is certainly among the best screens on the market. It?s got more vibrant reds and greens than the iPhone 4 Retina display and in case you aren?t into much saturation you will probably prefer it over the Samsung SuperAMOLED screens too (though we still find Nokia?s ClearBlack screens to be the champion in color rendering).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those observations were confirmed by our new contrast test, which the Arc passed with flying colors. The contrast of its 4.2? screen topped our charts, even though its brightness fell slightly short of the iPhone 4 result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, an LCD unit is unable to match the deep black contrast of an AMOLED screen, but given that limitation Sony Ericsson has done an excellent job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our test we did observe a pretty strange behavior of the Arc brightness setting. As you drag the slider to the middle, the Arc loses about 90% of its brightness instead of the 50% you would expect. Fortunately, the black levels deepen with lowering the backlight so the loss of contrast isn?t too significant, but we would suggest sticking to a higher setting to avoid problems with sunlight legibility. Unfortunately, the XPERIA Arc doesn?t have auto-brightness control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 04 April: Many of you confirmed that they actually do have automatic brightness control on their XPERIA Arcs. However hard as we tried (pointing flashlights at the spot where the ambient light sensor is supposed to be or covering it) we couldn't manage to make our unit to adjust its brightness. We suppose it's some kind of unit-specific issue that we had. We'll try to get another unit so we can double-check that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 April: We were able to confirm that all retail XPERIA Arc units will indeed have auto-brightness control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reality screen?s Achilles? heel is viewing angles. The advantage it holds against the competition quickly disappears as you tilt to wider viewing angles. The text on screen might remain visible but contrast degrades very quickly and colors get vastly distorted. It?s an unpleasant effect that you cannot see with the IPS matrix of the iPhone 4 or the two current best AMOLED technologies (ClearBlack and SuperAMOLED).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get a better idea of what we are talking about check out the following video comparing the XPERIA Arc display with the Galaxy S and the iPhone 4. Notice how quickly the Arc screen contrast degrades as the viewing angle widens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, we see the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc display as a major update over its X10 predecessor and all upgraders will certainly be happy with it. The inadequate viewing angles are the only thing to question about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc display we find the same three keys as on the X10. You get a Back button, a Home key that brings up recently used apps tab upon a long press and a Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three keys we mentioned are all well defined, so even if a bit thin, they?re unlikely to pose a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the proximity sensor and the earpiece. Sony Ericsson initially claimed there should also be an ambient-light sensor present here, but automatic brightness control was not enabled on either this test handset or the pre-release unit we had earlier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the XPERIA Arc holds the 3.5mm standard audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny power key and the microHDMI port are on top of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc. The power key is too small to be comfortable, though being slightly raised helps a bit. It certainly takes some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, an HDMI cable isn?t supplied in the box so you will need to grab one yourselves if you are into streaming your photos and videos to an HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc?s microUSB port is in the top right corner with a status LED above. The thin volume rocker is below and the miniscule camera key is all the way at the bottom. Considering the solid imaging potential of the XPERIA Arc we would have definitely preferred a larger and more convenient shutter key. This one is too small and placed too close to the corner. On a second thought however, most of the Arc?s direct competitors don?t even have a camera key (think iPhone 4, Optimus 2X and Galaxy S II).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we are more concerned with is the location of the 8 megapixel camera lens on the back. Too close to the edge, it is extremely likely to get covered by a finger when holding the handset in a position to shoot. You have to be extremely careful not to ruin your shots. That?s a problem with the iPhone 4 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is the other thing of note at the back. It?s placed on the other end of the backplate and due to the phone?s curved design it won?t get muffed too easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the non-hot-swappable microSD slot, the SIM slot and the second microphone pinhole, used in active noise cancelation during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Arc?s battery capacity is 1500 mAh and it?s said to last for up to 430 hours of stand-by or up to 7 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In actual usage, we managed to squeeze just over two days of moderate-to-heavy use (a few calls, an hour of browsing and an hour of gaming per day plus the occasional shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, the general handling of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is decent, though the sleek design poses some usability questions. The tiny shutter key, the non-hot-swappable microSD card and the lack of auto-brightness are our biggest grudges with the Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inward curve makes the handset pretty comfortable to hold. It doesn?t sit as nicely in your hand as the Sony Ericsson smartphones that use the human curvature design (outward curve), but the phone?s suave elegance more than makes up for that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc introduces two important changes to the company?s Android smartphone lineup. The Arc runs the new 2.3 version called Gingerbread, and it gets rid of the Mediascape interface. We can?t speak for everyone but it?s definitely a fair trade for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson still has Timescape to make their products distinguishable and axing Mediascape will probably reduce the future Android update delays. That probably makes the XPERIA Arc a more balanced product than the X10 software-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a short video demo of the XPERIA Arc user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.3 Gingerbread has brought lots of new APIs and extended the platform?s gaming capabilities, but the interface elements haven?t been drastically altered. And with Sony Ericsson skinning the whole thing it?s even harder to spot the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we particularly like is the Overview mode on the Sony Ericsson Arc. You pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new pane sets in with a cool transition effect to display all of your active widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s similar to HTC?s Leap view or what Samsung have on the Galaxy S. However widgets are not ordered in mini screens so you cannot see what?s on each of them. Widgets are shuffled instead so they can better use the space. They are as big as possible and thus easier to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next thing to note are the four docked shortcuts (two either side of the launcher key) on the homescreen. Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is nice and simple, the way it?s done on the iPhone. You drag an icon over another and a pop-up appears, prompting you to select a name and layout for the new folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are new animations when moving items around the homescreen, sorting them in folders or deleting them. There are no new wallpapers included in Gingerbread, but you can get as many as you want from the Android Market anyway. Sony Ericsson have included 24 static wallpapers and there are 11 live wallpapers too. You can also set a picture from your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new Sony Ericsson app called LiveWare is preinstalled on the XPERIA Arc. It lets you set the behavior of your handset when paired with an accessory. You can have an app launch automatically when headset, headphones or a charger is connected. You can, for example make the Arc start the music player each time you plug-in your headphones or go to picture frame mode each time you connect a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface. Gingerbread really takes things to a whole new level by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as general performance is concerned the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc does splendidly. It uses a Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon System-on-a-chip featuring a 1 GHz Scorpion CPU and the Adreno 205 GPU. The Gingerbread optimizations help too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it?s not synthetic benchmarks that we should focus on ? the real life performance matters here and the XPERIA Arc is smooth as silk. Sony Ericsson did a vastly better job this time than the XPERIA X10 a year ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. Timescape has a tabbed structure, allowing you to filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you can not only see the latest activities and updates from your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or call back if you have a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of the new Timescape is you can set it as a widget on you homescreen. It will show all of your updates as tiles. You no longer need to sacrifice all your homescreen estate. Good job!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface continued: Facebook integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update 20 July: Sony Ericsson recently introduced a new, deeper way of integrating Facebook in their recent Xperia smartphones (Arc, Neo, Pro, Play, Mini, Mini Pro, Active and Ray). We reviewed the Xperia Arc before that software enhancement was available, but now that we?ve updated our review unit, we finally went ahead and reviewed the changes. They call it Facebook inside Xperia and here is what it's like. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, Facebook integration is a rather loose term when it comes to mobile phones. It could simply mean an easy way for updating your status and a news feed widget on your homescreen or it can go deeper such as automatically having new fields in the phonebook or uploading a photo with the press of a dedicated hardware button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's take on the Facebook integration is definitely something along the line of the second example. It's deep, deeper than on most other Android smartphones but if you?re not into Facebook, it's unobtrusive enough. Facebook inside Xperia brings features such as a Like button in your photo gallery and your music player along with the mandatory sharing via Facebook. There are also lockscreen notifications and a new widget called Media Discovery, which sums up all the posted music by your friends and puts it right there on your homescreen. In the Contacts app you can see your friends' interests and galleries plus your own Facebook albums are now integrated with the in-built Gallery app next to the Picasa ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To enable the extra Facebook functionality, you setup a dedicated "Facebook Integration" account on the phone, which automatically pops up once you enter your regular Facebook account. Now let's go through some of the enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the Phonebook - the contacts in your phone, which you've linked with Facebook now have 3 separate panels. Swipe to the left and you'll see the contact's photo galleries on Facebook and another swipe takes you to the contacts likes and interests. It's similar to what we get on HTC smartphones with Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the music player, there you can now "Like" any song you're listening to. The info is automatically posted on Facebook wall where your friends can respond to it by liking it or commenting on it and sharing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, once you log into your Facebook account via the dedicated app your Facebook galleries get downloaded to the photos app. So now apart from the galleries you have on your phone's memory and on Picasa, you now get the ones you have on Facebook as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the gallery you can "Like" a photo again (yes, you can like your own photo) and see who else has done so. You can even read and write comments on a photo through the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Discovery homescreen widget shows you all the music and videos your friends share on Facebook. Selecting "View more" opens the Facebook app itself where you get a look of all of your friends' videos along with likes and comments, attached to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing, which is actually very old news, is the Calendar synchronization. Once you enter an event on Facebook it gets synced with the Xperia's calendar. Also all of the events yo have confirmed as Attending, will show up in your phone's calendar app automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to the Facebook notifications in the lockscreen. It works somewhat similar to those on the latest iOS 5 beta and shows that you have a new notification inside a baloon. This is nothing special and it's even somewhat disappointing. On iOS you see what the notification actually is ("Dexter Labs has done this or that on Facebook"), whereas on the Xperia you only see that you have a notification. It would have been better if it saved you the time to look it up by just saying what it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also the notifications on your lockscreen need the mobile data to be turned on even if you're on a Wi-Fi network, which is strange. If the mobile data is off you won't get any notifications whatsoever. And this goes for the entire Facebook integration experience - you need to have a SIM card in the phone all the time. Sounds like a bit of a bummer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, it?s a great idea to bring such deep Facebook integration to the Xperia smartphones and it should be well received by owners with "compulsive Facebook addiction disorder ". But it makes one think that such integration has been available for the most part on HTC droids (also Samsung's and others) for quite some time now. Is it a strong enough selling point all on its own for Sony Ericsson? Also users with X10s (the first Sony Ericsson Android device) are left out of the party for now as only the new line of Xperia handsets will get the magical Facebook treatment.The feature has been confirmed to arrive to the X10 with the Gingerbread update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the deeper integration is a welcome bonus for every user with a Facebook profile and Sony Ericsson has implemented it just right - it's clean and simple to use. And if you're not that into Facebook and don't have a profile, you can just skip the whole thing and use your Xperia smartphone just as you would in a world without social networks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc?s visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. The list can be sorted by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If someone is added in more than one account, you can ?join? their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony, no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the XPERIA Arc does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc. Scoring a Good result, the Arc isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might miss a call or two at times. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Android values simplicity in design and is very easy to use. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick Contacts feature only works in separate messages, not in the whole thread. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only to three lines, which makes working with longer texts harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Arc offers a just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even on the portrait keyboard, typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The Arc is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course. For proper typing, you should consider a QWERTY messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The droid gallery still downsizes the pictures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the XPERIA Arc's multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the XPERIA Arc as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the XPERIA Arc did play a 720p MP4 video though. And the 4.2? FWVGA Reality screen is a pure joy to watch. If you re-encode your videos before hand, the XPERIA Arc can make a good video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you should just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the XPERIA Arc is quite similar to the music section of the axed Mediascape app. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get send and delete options. There is also a dedicated search bar at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key, which allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service for song recognition is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update 04 April: It turns out that the default (normal) equalizer on the Arc actually boosts the bass and treble frequencies, instead of delivering a clean output. We retested the handset, using the flat equalizer and updated the text below to reflect our new findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pleased with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc performance in our audio quality test. The frequency response of the smartphone is perfect with no headphones attached and still easily within the +-dB limit with headphones on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk does get pretty mediocre when you plug in a pair of headphones, while the distortion levels increase too and we'd only describe them as average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings are pretty great, though - the noise levels and dynamic range scores are among the best we have seen. With an active external amplifier you are also getting some pretty low distortions and stereo-crosstalk readings. Plus the XPERIA Arc is reasonably loud so it's all looking pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 8 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed in our preview, the XPERIA Arc could?ve had a better shutter key and lens location, but imaging is still a key selling point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc boasts an 8 megapixel snapper with a single LED flash. The Arc uses an Exmor R backlit sensor which, in theory, provides better low-light images. In reality the advantage of the backlit technology is marginal at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Arc?s camera is quite intuitive. You have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features on the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder switch at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most used shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to pick a scene, turn on flash and enable/disable touch capture (i.e. take a shot by pressing the viewfinder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. As is to be expected from a device in this class, the XPERIA Arc also boasts face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is excellent. There?s plenty of fine detail in the XPERIA Arc shots (though surprisingly a bit lower compared to the X10) and the color rendering is good. Color saturation is slightly on the high side, but it's not too bad and if you are into punchier colors you might even like it better this way. There are no purple-fringing or over sharpening ? noise levels are in check too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HD video recording is a hot feature recently and the XPERIA Arc is doing pretty well with the frame rate. It?s 30fps and quite steady too. There were a few duplicated frames, but not that much to ruin the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Arc?s camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. Its approach is the same as on the XPERIA X10 and the Neo: it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe instead of fast and constant re-focusing. It?s certainly the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos run smooth and feature excellent colors and resolved detail. Oversharpening is the camcorder?s biggest issue. We hope Sony Ericsson fix that with a software update at some point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 03.08.11: Sony Ericsson released a software update that enables stereo sound when recording videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the XPERIA Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is one that we uploaded on YouTube for your convenience:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc has the full set of connectivity options: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), USB v2.0 and Bluetooth 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage is 320MB only, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone will ship with an 8GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nexus S though, there is no NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack and the mini-HDMI port complete the connectivity tally. Unfortunately you?ll have to buy your own HDMI cable, it?s not included in the retail box.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With added Flash 10.1 support and the latest and fastest UI version, 2.3.2 Gingerbread, the Arc?s web browser does a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 4.2? screen for web browsing. The Arc?s browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap zooming ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the big updates of the XPERIA Arc?s (or any other Gingerbread phone) web browser is the full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.2 player. YouTube videos played quite smoothly (360p-480p), and so did the games from Kongregate, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Arc supports the latest Adobe Flash 10.2 but you have to download it separately for free from the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on The large, high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching all kinds of files is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. Unfortunately you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But all of the applications missing on the XPERIA Arc can be downloaded for free off the Android Market in a matter of minutes, so it?s not a big deal really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc comes with a GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in about 2-3 minutes with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the main application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our XPERIA Arc came with Maps 5 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has plenty of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc runs the latest version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A year ago it seemed Sony Ericsson?s lack of inspiration was becoming chronic. With delayed updates and boring uniform looks the XPERIA lineup was going nowhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But something happened and they?re now keen to make up for lost time: a whole new generation of Android smartphones, new type of displays and camera sensors, the PlayStation phone. They?re even about to unlock the boot loader of the new XPERIA family ? something Sony Ericsson have been denying developers for years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc is a big part of that ? probably the most important part of the plan. The Arc is Sony Ericsson?s first Gingerbread droid, the first to have the new Reality display and Sony?s new Exmor R camera sensor. They?ve given it the best they have but the tech inside doesn?t tell the whole story. It?s the bold lines and compelling elegance that show Sony Ericsson know how to treat a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company?s slimmest smartphone is easily the most beautiful to date. The phone looks so good we?re wiling to forgive some of the design choices that were probably forced on the team: the lens and shutter key placement, the non-hot-swappable memory card slot or the lack of auto brightness control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Arc has it all in terms of features: big quality screen, awesome 8 megapixel camera and HD camcorder, the latest Android. Not less important, the phone has a soul and spirit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the only place it falls short is not being quite as future proofed as a proper flagship should be. It will be a while before dual-core phones start hitting real hard but when they do, the Arc will be vulnerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a few months? time it will be competing with the likes of the I9000 Galaxy S, which at that point should be running Gingerbread too. The LG Optimus 2X and the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II will be out of its reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 2X is keen to double the Arc?s bet with a dual-core Tegra2 chipset, but users should be ready to compromise the screen and the premium looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For both looks and performance, the Samsung Galaxy S II looks like it?s worth the wait. On top of the dual-core processor, powerful graphics chip, huge storage and the new Super AMOLED Plus screen, you?ll get an 8 megapixel snapper with 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the two handsets above are out of the Arc?s league, the smartphones to follow are more or less its equals. Each has a trick up the sleeve and you?d be wise to carefully consider your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, whether it?s the cameraphone (Nokia N8), or the Super AMOLED droid (Samsung Galaxy S), or the Google Phone (Nexus S), or the Windows 7 phone (HTC HD7) ? the Arc could be your handset of choice. A choice you?re unlikely to regret either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N8 ? Samsung I9000 Galaxy S ? Google Nexus S ? HTC HD7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end though, is the Arc worth it and did Sony Ericsson make a difference? The answer is yes, though not without reserves. The XPERIA Arc more than any other recent phone puts Sony Ericsson back on the map as a premium device manufacturer. And the Arc does command a premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's own XPERIA Neo costs some good 80 euro less and almost the same feature set sans the exquisite looks. Both offers solid smartphone experience and capable imaging but the Arc's looks tell a story. It's beautiful and powerful and will stay so at least for a few months. Enjoy and don?t let the dual core gang spoil your party. That?s for Sony Ericsson to worry about.</paragraph>
