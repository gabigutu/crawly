			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Affordable smartphones with specs that don't just scratch the spec sheet surface - those have been getting quite popular, and Lenovo is keen on being a part of it with the Vibe K5 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5-inch Full-HD screen, last year's top-selling midrange chipset rehashed for 2016, 2GB of RAM, a 13MP camera, dual-SIM connectivity, and a dedicated microSD slot sound like Lenovo's been paying attention to what's in demand. Certainly not going to shake up the Galaxy S7, but at around $130, it's a whole different piece of the pie the Vibe K5 Plus is after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First things first though - that name call for a little clarification. The K5 family consists of three models so far, the plain Vibe K5, the Vibe K5 Plus we have here, and the Vibe K5 Note. While some makers use the Plus to identify a larger screen, here it denotes the Full-HD resolution as opposed to the regular K5's 720p, and a Snapdragon 616 instead of a Snapdragon 415. And that's the entire list of differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the Vibe K5 Note that stands out, being the phablet of the bunch. A 5.5-inch Full-HD screen, Helio P10 chipset and a fingerprint sensor, an 8MP selfie camera and a larger battery clearly put the Note a notch above its siblings. It's a whole different matter why Lenovo has the K4 Note and the K5 Note both at the same time with only marginal differences in specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the task at hand - the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For $130 that's a very long list of features, and the disadvantages are far from deal-breakers. Perhaps the Android version is the one that stands out. With budget phones rarely getting updates, Lollipop is likely what the Vibe K5 Plus will spend its entire life with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The limited availability is more like the reason for the Vibe K5 Plus' existence, rather than an issue with the phone itself - after all, it was made to compete in emerging markets where price is a decider. The storage cap is but a minor hassle that is having to swap 32GB microSD cards, but we're not seeing it as a major turn-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, all that remains to be done is to find out if the spec sheet makes up a good smartphone experience. Joins us on the next page for the hardware overview.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus measures 142 x 71 x 8mm, which is right about average for a 5-incher. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 has a slightly more compact footprint, but it is half a millimeter thicker to house that huge 4,100mAh battery. At 142g, the Vibe K5 Plus is two grams lighter than the Redmi 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is built mostly out of polycarbonate, with the notable exception of the metal back cover - a welcome touch on a device in this price bracket. Design is generic, but that can be said of phones several times as expensive, so we won't hold that against it. On the contrary, the K5 Plus looks quite pleasingly simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its back panel has a satin finish, both the large metal part and the two strips of plastic top and bottom. Those are painted a couple of shades darker to serve as an accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module and single LED flash peek from cutouts in the top band, while below the lens you can recognize the secondary mic's pinhole. In the bottom band you have two speaker grilles - and there are actually as many speakers underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cover is removable and comes off together with the sides, buttons and all. Popping it off takes a bit of effort at first so it shouldn't come off by accident, but once you get it started, it's out of the way in an instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the back removed you get access to the battery and card slots. There are three of them, two for microSIMs and a dedicated microSD compartment - a setup we can applaud. And there's the two speakers right below the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone around, the FullHD 5-inch screen boasts some generous bezel all around. The entire face of the phone is outlined by a shiny silver-like frame, which serves to protect the edges of the glass, and also as tactile clue where the display ends. It's quite obviously made of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom bezel houses the capacitive keys, which have icons etched in the white front panel. Above the display there's the earpiece in the middle with the front camera and a bunch of sensors on either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the card slots under the hood, the sides of the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus are pretty neat. There's the power button midway on the right, the volume rocker above it and that's it - there's nothing on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is a similar affair - aside from the mic pinhole, there's nothing to be found here. And, yes, that means that the microUSB is on top. It's a solution Lenovo insists on for its budget models, and it takes some getting used to if you've been plugging cables on the other end for a lifetime. The 3.5mm jack is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 Plus feels comfortable in the hand thanks to its manageable size and slight curves on the back towards the sides. It's a touch too slippery though, with that smooth satin finish to blame.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5-inch FullHD display in a $130 phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus sports a 5-inch FullHD IPS display - pretty impressive at its price point. For the money, 720p is more than reasonable at this size, and the Plus has a 1080p panel with a pixel density of 441ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test saw the Vibe K5 Plus' screen as a good overall performer. With a maximum brightness of around 440 nits, it's right on par with its more expensive sibling, the K4 Note, and marginally brighter than the K3 Note we tested a while back. The Redmi 3 does go higher, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a contrast ratio around 1000:1 it's still behind the Redmi 3. Other displays in the entry level hover around the same value as the K5 Plus, so it's nothing to complain about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color accuracy is good enough, but far from exceptional, with whites leaning slightly towards blue. Then again, with an average DeltaE of 5.2, it's got more accurate colors as a whole than not only the Redmi 3, but also the Mi 4S and the LG G5 flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In bright sunlight there's only so much that can be achieved with an LCD panel, and the Vibe K5 Plus does pretty well with what it's got. Its sunlight contrast ratio is better than what the K4 Note is capable of, though not quite as good as the Redmi 3. The K5 Plus fares noticeably better than the Moto G (3rd gen) though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 Plus is a dual-SIM smartphone and it takes microSIMs in both slots. Both are 2G-capable, but only one gets the 3G/4G treatment. LTE is Cat. 4 for theoretical transfer speeds of 150Mbps down and 50Mbps of upload. It has a dedicated microSD slot - so no quandaries over extra storage or an extra SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get Wi-Fi b/g/n (no ac) with hotspot support, GPS with A-GPS, Bluetooth v4.1, and an FM radio receiver. There's no NFC or an infrared port, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port is USB OTG enabled, and you also get a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus packs a 2,750mAh battery, which is the same as the power pack inside the non-Plus Vibe K5 - a phone with a lower-res display and an inferior chipset. You can see then why we might have been worried about the Vibe K5 Plus' battery endurance. In the end, while the K5 Plus is no marathon runner, its results aren't all that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certainly not if 3G voice calls dominate your smartphone use - with an excellent almost 32 hours of talk time this Lenovo phone places around the top of our all-time chart in this respect. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 with its 4,100mAh battery (pretty much exactly 50% higher capacity) can only go an hour longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the display on, and the processor doing some number crunching, things aren't looking that great. Still, about 9 hours of web surfing over wi-fi is a decent longevity, average we'd call it. It's video playback that is a bit of a letdown, with just 7 and a half hours before the K5 Plus call it quits. The Redmi 3 does show its strength in both of these disciplines, with about 15 and 18 hours respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update (09 Aug 2016): While in the process of reviewing the Lenovo Vibe K5 (non-Plus), we stumbled upon some significant discrepancies when comparing its battery life to the Vibe K5 Plus. Analyzing the results led us to the conclusion that we had wrongly carried out the call test of the Vibe K5 Plus on a 2G network, instead of the usual 3G. We duly retested the K5 Plus, and the updated scorecard is now featured below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus runs on a heavily customized Android 5.1. Lenovo calls it Vibe OS, but unlike other manufacturers who make it a point to advertise their skins, Lenovo is more restrained about it. The interface is thoroughly reworked and Material design is only visible here and there. The company also rocks back and forth between user interface designs, and the Vibe K5 Plus resembles the K3 Note a lot more than it does the Vibe K4 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a rather standard affair. The default layout consists of a clock widget with a date, followed by a list of notifications. You also get shortcuts for quick access to the dialer and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical fashion for a droid coming out of China, there's no app drawer - all your apps reside on the homescreens. New ones can be added with ease, existing ones can be rearranged and any homescreen tab can be set as default home. Screen transition effects can be selected, and you can choose whether to be able to cycle back to the first one after reaching the end or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a wide selection of themes available too, complete with icon packs, and these can change the vibe of the Vibe K5 Plus completely. Some of them look better than others with non-system icons - the more customized the theme, the more out of place Google Chrome looks, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive keys below the display are Recent tasks/Home/Back, left to right. The recent tasks one doubles as a context menu button and that's a bit odd in truly Material design apps, which have the three-dot menu in the top right Making things even less intuitive, the context menu and the three-dot menu often contain different options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the ambiguous nature of the left capacitive key, getting to the recent tasks requires a long press, instead of a tap. Naturally, that adds an extra bit of waiting to an action you'd be doing constantly. There's a "Clear all" button, in the diagonally opposite top right corner, so you'd be stretching your thumbs a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there's a task manager that gives you more detailed information on what resources each app is using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification shade works in two stages. Pull down once with one finger, and you get notifications only, pull down a second time and you get the entire list of quick toggles, with notifications squished below. There's no priority row of toggles that gets opened on the first pull, it's none or all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the most popular chipsets in last year's midrange, you can easily call the Snapdragon 615 ubiquitous. We have about 70 devices powered by it in our database, and the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus uses a slightly updated version of that SoC, which Qualcomm calls Snapdragon 616. The difference is so subtle that popular apps like CPU-Z report it simply as Snaprdragon 615.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here half of the 8 Cortex-A53 processor cores can reach up to 1.5GHz (so slightly lower than Qualcomm's nominal 1.7GHz), while the other 4 are capped lower, at 1.21GHz. The GPU is the familiar Adreno 405, and operating memory is 2GB. The setup is so common for a reason and the reason is that it provides adequate overall performance over daily use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with raw CPU performance, we ran the K5 Plus through Geekbench, where it scored nearly identical results to the Oppo F1, itself powered by the S616. Popular S615 devices like the Motorola Moto X Play and Sony Xperia M4 Aqua are trailing behind, but they were never among the best ambassadors for the chip, at least as far as benchmarks are concerned. More importantly the Vibe K5 Plus bested one chief competitor in the face of the Xiaomi Redmi 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II 2.0 is an established compound benchmark, which can give you an idea of the overall performance you can expect from the Vibe K5 Plus. With a score in the high 800s, the smartphone is somewhat behind the Oppo F1, but it's equally ahead of the Redmi 3, so another win against its archrival. The major names like the Moto X Play and Xperia M4 aqua are left behind too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 suffers another loss in the older version of Basemark OS II, where the K5 Plus' lead is even more pronounced. Then again, the F1 is further ahead of Lenovo's entry, too. The Xperia M4 Aqua does redeem itself a bit, but not so for the Moto X Play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Antutu's become another industry standard benchmark, even if its numbers are too often used for bragging rights. We haven't yet had the opportunity to build an extensive database of scores from the latest benchmark version, especially when non-flagships are concerned, but we do have a few affordable entries to compare the Vibe K5 Plus with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing that can be said is that the Lenovo smartphone posts a virtually identical number to the Oppo F1, which is markedly more expensive. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3's are flying high here, especially the Snapdragon 650 version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Antutu 5 is where we've got a larger selection of smartphones, and a wider base for comparison. Similar figures as the Redmi 3 here, both ahead of the Xperia M4 Aqua, but still not on par with the Moto X Play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphics performance is where the Snapdragon 61x typically struggles with 1080p displays. The Vibe K5 Plus is no different in this respect, only managing 5.5fps on GFXBench Manhattan. Onscreen or off, the Vibe K5 Plus put out the same frame rate, its display being 1080p, which is the standardized resolution for the off screen test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most others fare better when rendering in their native resolution - one of the few advantages of 720p displays. Both the F1 and the Redmi 3 fall in this category, and so does the M4 Aqua, and all three manage more than twice higher frame rates. That said, even the Moto X Play with its FullHD display scores about 10% higher than the K5 Plus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Basemark X the K5 Plus loses to the Xiaomi Redmi 3, if only 5% behind. All of the usual suspects have overtaken the Lenovo, though, the Oppo F1 by the longest margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Custom phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus has a fully custom phonebook. It is laid out across four tabs: dialer, call log, contacts, and favorites. There's smart dial support, as well as speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts is self explanatory - you get an alphabetized list of them, which you can search or filter them by first letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 Plus is a dual SIM device (both micro SIMs) and as such has settings for SIM handling. Each card can be assigned a name and a number, and cards can be disabled from the menu, so you don't have to physically remove them, if for some reason you don't want to use one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can select default cards to use for voice calls, messaging and data, or have the phone ask you each time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus did a very good job in our loudspeaker test, thanks to its two powerful speakers. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is noticeably quieter, and while the Moto G 3rd gen has the same "Very good" rating as the Vibe, old-school ringtones come out louder from the Lenovo phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note employs the stock Android keyboard, which many users like. It doesn't have a dedicated number row, but numbers do come out upon a long press. You can choose between Material and Holo color themes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 Plus uses a non-customized AOSP gallery. You're greeted with a grid view of your albums, and you can easily create a new one. Inside the album the images are displayed two-a-row, and no pinch gesture is going to change that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor, on the other hand, is a bit more powerful. It offers the obvious cropping, rotation and mirroring, color filters and picture frames, but also more serious editing like curves adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player, the task is handled from within the gallery. There's little in the way of features other than looping the video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is a similarly barebone app. It has the usual tabs for artists, songs and playlists and can pull album art and subtitles off the internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K5 Plus comes with Dolby Atmos certified audio enhancements. They're accessed from the settings menu where the Dolby Atmos screen holds the equalizer and other settings. You can change different modes (Movie, Music, Game, Voice, Custom), each getting its own 5-band equalizer setting. Additionally, you have things like surround virtualizer, dialogue enhancer and volume leveler.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 Plus comes with an FM radio receiver. It lacks RDS so you'll need to enter station names manually. You can assign favorites and record off the radio, and you can play through the loudspeaker, but you need to have the headset plugged in to serve as the antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio is loud and mostly clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus showed perfect clarity in the first part of our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produced great scores top to bottom and had nicely high loudness to complete the excellent showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Damage from plugging in our standard headphones consisted of a notable stereo crosstalk increase and some drop in loudness, but the latter still remained very good. A really good performance for any phone, which given the price range of the K5 Plus is downright impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus features a 13MP camera with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels in its native 4:3 mode. The lens has an f/2.2 aperture. A single-LED flash is present but there are no niceties in the line of OIS and phase detection/laser autofocus - not that you'd expect them at the price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the camera app is logically laid out. On the top left you get four shortcuts (front/rear camera switch, flash mode selector, HDR toggle and shutter release mode). The settings menu is accessed via a dedicated shortcut in the bottom left corner, which brings up a tabbed interface with tabs for stills, video and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has provided the basic shooting modes - there's Normal, Panorama and Effects. While other makers give you a Pro/Manual mode, here you can just go about and tinker with some of the variables from the settings menu. You get white balance presets, and manual ISO selection, but also access to image properties - sharpness, saturation, the lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera output of the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is on the good side of average with a lot of resolved detail, though images are a little on the soft side. Sharp edges and lines are rendered decidedly better than foliage - tree leaves aren't particularly well defined. The shadows are also riddled with noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color reproduction is generally accurate, with just a bit too much saturation, though you can adjust that with the sliders in settings, if you don't like the added punch. White balance suffers on occasion and you get one very warm photo, but starting with the second, it catches up and brings things to normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone consistently exposes well, there are no pronounced tendencies to err on either side. Dynamic range isn't among the K5 Plus' greatest strengths - shadows often end up pitch black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode on the Vibe K5 Plus does what it's meant to - brightens up the shadows and tones down the highlights. On occasion it produces over-the-top results, in other scene the effect is more natural. HDR shots are a touch softer than regular photos, but overall detail is preserved. Oddly, the FOV gets a tiny bit narrower in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode on the Vibe K5 Plus is but a tick in the specsheet. At a little over 600 pixels tall panoramas are lacking in resolution and are very much useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at how the Lenovo K5 Plus stacks up against the competition in our Photo Compare Tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus in our photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is equipped with a 5MP front-facing camera, mated to a rather dim by today's standards f/2.8 lens. It creates detailed images but has limited dynamic range. For what it is, though, the selfie camera does a good job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>FullHD at 30fps is the best the Vibe K5 Plus can offer in video recording, but that's hardly grounds for complaint in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded with a bit rate of 20Mbps with a stereo audio stream at 96Kbps. The captured detail is about average, it's certainly not impressive, but we've seen worse. Perhaps the most annoying bit about the K5 Plus' video recording is the persistent focus hunting, which you can observe no less than 4 times in the 30-second video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p video sample (11s, 28MB) taken straight from the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A couple of browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus comes with two browsers pre-installed - UC Browser and Google Chrome. Chrome you know and love for its integration with your Google account among other things, but UC Browser isn't as ubiquitous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The squirrel-branded alternative is designed to be fast and light but has the bases duly covered with a data-saving feature, night and incognito modes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pre-installed, you'll find the Route 66 navigation app, or at least a free 30-day trial for voice-guided navigation. Considering a license is &#x20ac;30, you'd probably stick with Google/Bing Maps or similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Companion is a mobile trouble-shooter. You can search for walkthroughs for your device (in written or video form), you can check for firmware updates (with data back up included) and diagnosing all the hardware of the phone (e.g. testing the vibration or the loudspeaker).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File browser makes it easy to find files of a specific type (e.g. documents or photos), it will even handle ZIPs. Of course, you can browse the full folder structure of both the internal storage and the microSD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature lets you wirelessly manage your files through your computer browser (as long as both the computer and phone are connected to the same network). This functionality is based on SwiFTP, which is available on the Play Store as FTP Server. It's better to use a proper FTP app, though, your browser offers only limited functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SYNCit allows you to backup Contacts, SMS and Call log to the Lenovo cloud. If you don't want to set up an account, you can backup to the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a trial version of McAfee LiveSafe, which can scan for viruses, protect your personal info, and help you recover your device in case you lose it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a built-in compass app, so you don't have to deal with ad-supported alternatives from the Play Store, the calculator has a scientific mode in portrait (when's the last time you saw one), and the sound recorder can save in .amr, .3gpp, and .wav formats.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of build and finish, Lenovo kept things simple but sturdy. The back cover is largely made of metal, which you wouldn't expect for the price</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good display performance across all tests, brightness, contrast and sunlight legibility are on the right side of average</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery endurance rating of 64 hours, exceptional longevity in voice calls, good in web browsing, decent in video playback. It's removable too, so you can pack a spare for emergencies</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standard benchmark performance of the chipset, GPU struggles somewhat with the FullHD resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android is only Lollipop, and we know not to expect updates with budget phones. There are a few mild annoyances with the custom skin, but nothing you can't learn to live with</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker is really loud, earning a Very good rating</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP primary camera produces good image quality, detail is above average, but so is noise in the shadows. Occasional white balance inaccuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front camera shoots detailed selfies, but it's lacking in dynamic range</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p video recording suffers from focus hunting, quality is average</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Flagships are nice, sure thing, but not everyone has cash to burn and certainly not everyone needs to. At a fraction of the price you can have the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus and not miss out on too much. Alright, you won't be getting the premium materials and build, the software bangs and whistles or the speediest performance, but in terms of features you're pretty well covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts with a sharp display that did quite well in all of our tests - doesn't top any charts, but doesn't fail miserably in any particular area. Battery life is good too, especially if you do a lot of actual talking on the phone, less so of video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software has its imperfections, struggling to strike a balance between an old navigation concept and Android Lollipop, but a few days into it you should be cruising. The media app package is rather basic, but it's nothing a quick trip around the Play Store can't fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear-firing stereo speakers do stand out as an area where the Vibe K5 Plus rises above its budget range - the phone packs quite a punch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won't be disappointed by the Vibe K5 Plus' camera either. Well, unless you want to shoot video, where the overly eager autofocus all but ruins it. Stills, on the other hand, are reasonably detailed, if a little noisy, and you'd be well covered for casual snaps out in the open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what else we discovered during our time with the Vibe K5 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selection of phones retailing at the Vibe K5 Plus' price isn't what you would call wide. That said, in some markets you could opt for the Xiaomi Redmi 3 for about the same amount of cash. You'd be getting significantly longer battery endurance, plus a fancy textured metal body. Then again, the Redmi 3's display is 720p only, unlike the K5 Plus' FullHD and, given its limited availability, it's not really an option for most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) is more readily available, coming from a time when Moto wasn't a Lenovo sub-brand. There's an inferior chipset inside the Moto G, and a lower-res display, but it is getting Marshmallow, which the K5 Plus may not. The Moto G (3rd gen) is also IPx7 certified and can be submerged in water, which the K5 Plus better not try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another one of the affordable 720p 5-inchers, the Meizu m2 comes with a weaker chipset, but then again it's also a few bucks cheaper. With the rest of the specs pretty much identical, the decider here is most likely brand preference, though availability will likely be a factor, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Lenovo does have a few of its own options available. The most obvious one is the Vibe K5 non-Plus. Same everything, except for lower display resolution and an inferior chipset, it'll likely last longer on a charge thanks to the combination of these two. The plain model will also save you a few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the K3 Note with a larger 5.5-inch display, FullHD too. Its otherwise very similar feature set includes a dual-LED flash (not that it's going to sway someone in either direction) and a slightly more potent chipset, but battery life is considerably shorter. The K3 Note has received a Marshmallow update, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you have it, the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is a $130 phone that can play with the big boys, and put up a respectable fight. It's not going to win any beauty pageants and it won't challenge the flagships on features and performance, but it doesn't need to. The Vibe K5 Plus is trying to come across as a good affordable all-rounder, and that's precisely what it is.</paragraph>
