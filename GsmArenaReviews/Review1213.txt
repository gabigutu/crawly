			<paragraph>The HTC press conference pulled the curtain off what had been keeping the Taiwanese busy, and they certainly got the audience impressed. HTC unveiled their new One series of smartphones, all four of which have Beats audio and feature enhanced video and photo capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also caught wind of an upcoming release of HTC's Sense 4.0 UI, which holds some neat improvements over the previous version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is also keen to give certain incentives to encourage consumers to buy more of the upcoming devices, including free Dropbox cloud storage of up to 25 GB over two years within purchase.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One X hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X is the HTC flagship everybody was holding their breath for. The phone's supposed to mark a new direction for HTC towards less quantity and more quality, and they certainly mean it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X packs the mighty NVIDIA Tegra 3 SoC with 4-PLUS-1 processors on board and 1GB of RAM. This quiet beast sleeping inside is running Android 4.0 and the home-brewed Sense 4.0 UI skin on top. And it looks stunning. HTC have obviously done their homework as the number of new features suggests. There're some fresh touches to the overall look and feel of the latest Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Android 4.0 and Sense 4.0, they look magnificent on the One X's non-pentile Super LCD 2 display. Colors are vivid and the overall brightness is good on the massive 4.7-inch 720p HD display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has gone the extra mile building the One X's chassis. It's a single chunk of polycarbonate plastic just like the Nokia N9 and Lumia 800 and the seamless curved screen for edge-to-edge swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, the 8MP camera at the back is one of the headlines. It shoots 1080p full HD video and has what HTC call the "Double Shutter", meaning the One X can snap stills while shooting videos without interrupting the video capture. The f/2.0 lens aperture and the BSI sensor should fix the problems plaguing HTC cameras of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also have a cool car mode that shows simple screens with easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes a quick hands-on video of the HTC One X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One S stands right below the One X in the HTC lineup, and looks like a solid contender in the upper midrange. The aluminum unibody holds a 1.5GHz dual-core and 1GB of RAM. This isn't your average unibody, though. It's been given a crystaline ceramic metal finish. We honestly hear it for the first time, but can't deny it sounds kind of cool. Plasma-baked aluminum is said to be four times harder than the garden variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main attraction however, is the 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display. Like it's bigger brother, the One S runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with a Sense 4.0 topping. You know we are fans of the AMOLED display technology and it didn't disappoint us on the One S. Blacks are deep and colors are crisp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One S is also slim. In fact, it's the slimmest device HTC has ever put into production. It's waistline is just 7.6mm thick and puts itself amongst the slimmest of Droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we created a quick video, so you can get a better idea of the HTC One S real life performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One V hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC didn?t have a working One V to show, but we still managed to get out some info on it. It runs a Qualcomm S2 chipset, so it has the good old Scorpion core and 512MB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design-wise it's very reminiscent of the HTC Legend (you can say it has its chin). It trumps its grandpa with Beats Audio sound enhancement, but you won't get a free Beats headset with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an entry level device, so it has to make do with a regular 3.7" WVGA LCD display and Sense 3.6, rather than the latest version. You still get 25GB of Dropbox storage, but that lasts only 2 years. The internal storage for the One V is very limited - all you get is 4GB of non-expandable memory.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One X LTE hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One X for AT&amp;T is the LTE sibling of the global One X flagship. One the outside, the shows no difference than the global version ? it is the same white clad looker of a smartphone with an added carrier logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under its hood however, the HTC One X LTE packs Qualcomm?s latest Snapdragon S4 chipset with two Krait CPU cores, clocked at 1.5GHz ? a serious departure from the quad-core Tegra 3 of the One X. The GPU of the One XL is Adreno 225.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as performance of the One X for AT&amp;T is concerned, don?t let its dual-core CPU deceive you. The handset feels just as snappy as its Tegra 3 featuring relative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side of the HTC One X LTE, there were no surprises. Like the global One X, the device runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with Sense 4.0, and integrated Beats Audio on board. Of course, you will see some AT&amp;T proprietary software preinstalled once the smartphone hits the shelves in the near future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera unit of the One X LTE is also the same as the one found in the One X. Yet another amazing feature, which the 8MP snapper has, is the continuous burst mode. It allows you to take up to 100 shots with the camera at a time, just by pressing and holding the virtual shutter key ? a function which has come straight out of a paparazzo?s dreams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the HTC One X LTE do a few tricks on video here.</paragraph>
