			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is still picking up pace in the smartphone market, with the Microsoft-driven Lumias yet to make the impact the Finns have been hoping for since the strategy reset. In the meantime, the company has been enjoying a pretty easy run in the featurephone market, which is now virtually free or real competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha lineup is doing pretty well, as testified by the interest rates on this very website, but the long-term challenge for Nokia remains. Fending off entry-level smartphones and securing the future of the dumbphone kind may seem a futile effort, but the likes of the Asha 311 beg to differ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the best spec'd member of the family has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha Touch interface cannot match the versatility of proper smart platforms with hundreds of thousands of available apps. However, the simple featurephone UI allows for superior performance on modest hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 311 uses that to its advantage and promises an experience that isn't far off similarly priced smartphones. What's more, the not-too-tech-savvy users targeted here will appreciate the simplicity and convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 has no illusions about its standing in the pecking order, but it shows commitment to hard work and desire to prove to users that they're making the right choice buying it. This one is not about boasting rights or acing benchmarks - yet you can count on a reasonably fluid touchscreen experience, solid connectivity and an app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although the Asha 311 is the flagship of sorts of the Nokia dumbphone family, its retail package is identical to that of its siblings. There's the usual pair of headphones, a short USB cable and a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2GB microSD card comes pre-inserted in the phone to complete a pretty decent package for the price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 311 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 106 x 52 x 12.9 mm, the Asha 311 is just a tad smaller than the Asha 305, but the difference is hard to spot unless you have the two side by side. They might not be the slimmest smartphones out there, but they are still compact enough for comfortable single-handed use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of just 95 g is another nice part of the Asha 311 experience - you can almost forget the phone is in your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 is an easily recognized as part of the family. Designed with the same characteristic curves, the Asha 311 looks isn't vastly different from its siblings, never mind the changed button layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly however, that is not the greatest compliment to pay to a phone. We're not impressed with the glossy finish, which this time is applied to almost the entire back panel, and looks cheapish. Although the general build quality is pretty decent (even more so considering the price range), the Asha 311 isn't much of a looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A large part of that is attributed to the amount of unused space around the 3" display. We're used to seeing high-end handsets use the available space better, so when you look at a handset like the Nokia Asha 311, you can instantly tell it's not part of the elite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there's an earpiece and a brand logo. The proximity sensor is to be seen up there as well as the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen you'll find the mouthpiece, which is right below the thin strip of plastic that accommodates the Call keys. The End key will exit any currently running app and take you back to the homescreen. It's a power button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Nokia Asha 311 you get the volume rocker and the lock button. Their press is not the best we have seen, but they don't really raise any usability issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is placed at the top of the device alongside a 3.5 mm audio jack and the Nokia proprietary charging port. The Asha 311 comes with one of those old-school Nokia chargers but can be charged off USB too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side and the bottom of the Nokia Asha 311 are completely bereft of controls, the lanyard eyelet the only thing of interest there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Nokia Asha 311 is where the 3.2MP camera lens is located. There's no LED flash alongside it to assist its low-light performance, just the resolution label and the Nokia logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is also at the back, below the shiny strip that separates the glossy black battery cover and the matte gray bit at the bottom. We'd rather have that matte finish used on the entire body, but the Nokia designers decided otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 311 is powered by a 1110 mAh Li-Ion battery, which is rated at up to 696 h of 2G stand-by or up to 768 h of 3G idling. Talk time stands at 14h (2G) and 6h (3G), but even if you use 3G connectivity (the Asha 311 boasts some impressive download speeds), you should be looking at a couple of days at least on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory slot and the SIM compartment are underneath the battery, so no hot-swap for the complimentary 2GB card.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 comes with the standard for the family 3" WQVGA LCD. However there are some nice upgrades compared to the unit we saw on the Asha 305. For one, there's a polarization filter here that should improve sunlight legibility. There's also a protective layer of Gorilla Glass on top of the display for extra protection and those are normally really hard to come by in this class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the screen underneath is not too bright and the low resolution gives icons a dot-matrix-printer look. The colors look a bit washed out as well, but to be fair, competition is not doing much better in that aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time, Nokia went with a capacitive screen, which is far more responsive than on the Asha 305. It's not as good as on the entry-level droids, but still an improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the Asha 311 score from our display sunlight legibility test. It actually fared impressively well, beating quite a few elite competitors. That polarization filter that Nokia installed is obviously doing a marvelous job.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We can't say we're too fond of the Nokia Asha 311 in terms of design but the build looks solid. Fingerprints are an issue and overall, it's the looks that raise doubts not durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not that you could realistically expect much better in this price range. Good looks are normally achieved by the use of expensive materials and those just can't be squeezed in a budget this tight.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swipe-driven Series 40 a.k.a. Asha Touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Series 40 has long been the main platform for Nokia - the Finns have sold literally billions of the S40 feature phones. The latest iteration, called Asha Touch, is the best S40 we've seen by quite some distance. It also does a much better job at transitioning from a D-pad operated to a touchscreen-only interface than Symbian did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha Touch software takes a lot of design cues from its Symbian (or "Nokia OS" if you will) and MeeGo brothers, and as such the user interface structure is based on the MeeGo one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All interactions are touch-based, except for the red receiver key which is a handy way to bring out the homescreen or close an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen offers a big clock with the date underneath. A familiar sideways swipe unlocks the phone. Before you do that, you must first wake up the screen, of course. To do that you need to press the hardware lock key; double tap like on the Nokia N9 doesn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is an arrangement of three side-scrollable homescreens in MeeGo fashion. The default one is the app launcher - the new Asha Touch gets straight to business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left will take you to the dialer. In fact, this screen can be customized to show either the music player or the radio but having the dialer always a swipe away is probably the most useful of the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third homescreen is what was previously known as Active Standby. It's now a pane to fill with shortcuts to frequently used apps or contacts. A tap and hold on that screen triggers Edit mode, so you can choose shortcuts and contacts to add. As usual, the time and date are displayed too, which in turn serve as shortcuts to the alarm app and the calendar. There are no other widgets available here unfortunately, e.g. a music player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status bar is visible on top of any of the three screens and you can either tap to expand it or pull it down. It displays notifications of missed events and quick toggles for mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sound profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you get shortcuts to the music player, the phone and messaging apps. While S40 Asha Touch doesn't really do multitasking, those three apps are almost always available to you, even inside Java apps (the only exception is full screen apps). You can change the track, send a message, make a call and go back to where you left your app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications are displayed on the lockscreen too. A convenient shortcut is swiping a notification, which will take you to the relevant app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tiny number icon on the Messaging icon in the app launcher shows the text messages you have received but not yet read. There are similar new email notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a missed call that requires your attention, the notification area drops down a bit to briefly display the number and then pulls back up. It leaves a small handle as a reminder, which you can pull to see who's been calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are minor but nice touches to a completely revamped interface, which is surprisingly feature-rich, yet beautifully simple. Soft keys are nowhere in sight - every app or screen you open has just a tiny back key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface also uses transitions as it moves from screen to screen. On the decently powerful Nokia Asha 311 hardware, they are acceptably smooth and relatively nice to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, the underpowered Asha 305 left us unimpressed, but Asha Touch on the 311 is a huge step forward. It's at least as fast, fluid and responsive as the entry level smartphones and although it lags occasionally, it's not too irritating. The MeeGo-inspired design makes sure all functions are easy to reach at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't even miss multitasking - the Asha 311 comes with all the essential functions as native apps, so they can receive notifications in the background, and the call/text/music functionality is always accessible. It's the most common use case - especially considering there aren't that many third-party apps to switch between (e.g. you're not going to use a third-party music player).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S40 phonebook has a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 311 features a redone Series 40 phonebook. Under the new Asha Touch interface it integrates with the Call log and the Dialer and that's more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are displayed with a photo and number and, on top of the actual list, you get the Advanced menu and Add new contact shortcut. Then comes the search field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual contact details are displayed on a completely redesigned screen compared to previous S40 phonebooks. You get a faded contact's picture as a background, with a huge name across and a number below. A few big thumbable icons at the bottom of the screen let you call, text or email the person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, email address, ringtone or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - the SIM card or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the most part, the telephony options on the Asha 311 are pretty straightforward. As we already said, the Contacts, the Call Log and the dialer are integrated like in mature smart platforms. What's missing is smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no reception problems with the Nokia Asha 311. We tested its loudspeaker and found it loud enough, though not as good as other Asha phones we've tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is as good as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in the default view of the messaging app lets you delete the conversation or call/email the contact in question instead. Creating a message is pretty straightforward. You can add multiple contacts from your phonebook or simply punch in numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text entry, you can choose between a portrait multitap keypad and a landscape QWERTY keyboard. You get a character and message counter either way. Unfortunately, there's no text selection or copying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same QWERTY keyboard we saw in the Asha 305, and were less than impressed with. Although a welcome addition, it's far from comfortable to use. We wouldn't call it a keyboard really - just letters sprinkled on a blank page, no borders between them, nothing to at least remotely resemble keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default email view is Inbox but Folder view is supported too. Multiple emails can be moved or deleted using the advanced menu in the top left corner. You can switch between accounts from the fourth tab at the bottom of the screen. A tap and hold on an email will allow you to reply, delete, star, forward or mark it as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and a small * appears on the Mail icon in the app launcher when a new email has arrived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chat client supports multiple services - Facebook, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, Yahoo and Nokia Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 has something that makes the (supposedly dumb) S40 UI look much smarter than the likes of iOS and Windows Phone. That's right, we are talking about a full-featured file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is called Files and lists all your local folders with the memory card on top. Different icons are available for the different file types, the multimedia files appear with small thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few handy options are available in the advanced menu - change view and sorting, add new folder or mark some/all files. If you tap and hold on a file you'll get options such as copy, cut, paste, rename, delete, mark and details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has everything you may need in a file browser and puts to shame many smart file explorers thanks to its simple yet powerful interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Functional gallery and photo editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is a Symbian copycat. Photos are displayed in a three-column grid, with kinetic scrolling enabled. The gallery has one problem - it can't show more than 1000 images. So if your memory card is full of pictures, the Asha 311 is not the best choice of device to browse them on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize your photos into albums and there is an album view as a separate tab in the gallery. The video section is the final tab and lists any supported videos you've uploaded on your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a file lets you rename, delete, share or assign the image to a contact or set it as wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto-rotation and pinch zooming are enabled in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit pictures from the advanced menu. The available options are crop, rotate, flip, effects, warp, add frame, clip art, add text, adjust brightness and contrast, retune colors or do auto enhance. Not bad, is it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The renovated music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has a rather basic interface with lots of hidden features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen displays a large album art picture, alongside the track name, a scrubber and music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen has three tabs, the first one being the Now Playing screen. The next one is the Library with the default sorting options - all tracks, artists, albums, genres and videos. The last tab has your custom playlists with a few default ones available - recently added, recently played, most played and now playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shuffle, repeat and equalizers are available too. You can also play music over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player supports background playback, but there are no quick controls in the notification area or the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia Asha 311 comes with a neat and simple interface. You can change stations with the dedicated controls at the bottom. There is a tab with all available stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio has RDS support and automatic rescanning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 311 was able to impressively clean output. All of the readings of the featurephone were excellent and its volume levels were very high, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, plugging in a pair of headphones leads to a huge spike in intermodulation distortion, which is rather damaging to the overall sonic experience. Stereo crosstalk rises as well, but that's not as worrying. Now add the volume levels which drop to average and the far worsened frequency response and you get a rather mediocre performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player within this version of Series 40. You can find you videos in the dedicated video tab of either the gallery or the music player. Or browse them in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 311 was capable of playing most of the files we threw at it, including AVI, MP4 and 3GP, and had no problem with DivX/Xvid videos. Of course, videos above 720p were a no-go, but the Asha 311 supports all kind of audio codecs and it played the sound of even incompatible video files (including the 1080p videos in our collection).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 has a 3MP fixed-focus camera that produces photos at maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536. The camera interface has been updated but still offers just a few settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera's main UI has four shortcuts in each corner of the viewfinder and surprise - they're orientation aware. This is a bit of joke really - one of them being a Back button, which has to always fall in the bottom right corner of the screen, they realign rather messily. Not to mention, the auto-rotation isn't the fastest around. Still, this is a surprisingly advanced feature to have in such a basic camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you have settings, camcorder/still camera toggle and a shortcut to the gallery. The virtual shutter is always centered at the bottom, whether in portrait or landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Settings you can set effects, self-timer, grid and scenes. There is a deeper Advanced settings menu with resolution options, camera sounds, orientation, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is nothing spectacular, and there is a fair amount of noise when viewed at native resolution. The camera has adequate color reproduction, but had some problems with nailing down the proper exposure in outdoor shots.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording isn't exactly the Asha 311's forte. It does VGA at 25 fps - which is about what you can expect from a phone in this class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 25 fps result in a little bit of choppiness when looking at fast-moving objects, and the same exposure problems from the camera are also present in the 3GP videos it records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the VGA at 25fps sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: pentaband fast data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 is a quad band device (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900) and offers GPRS and EDGE support as well. There's also pentaband 3G (HSDPA 14.4, HSUPA 5.76), Wi-Fi b/g/n, and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging, but we had some serious problems getting it to charge with anything other than the A/C adapter via its dedicated charging port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 311 also has a memory card slot (and a complimentary 2GB microSD card). Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The new web browser is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 boasts a really cool new browser. Its start screen has a unified URL and search bar and a few handy shortcuts to favorite websites and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed interface offers one-tap access to Favorites, Downloads and Apps. The Favorites tab has the History, Home and Start page shortcuts, and you can add your own bookmarks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser does the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quickly (even on EDGE) and don't use much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get only two zoom levels (again, just like Opera Mini): page overview and zoomed in. A single tap will zoom in on the desired part of the page. To zoom back out to overview you need to hit a dedicated button in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the performance is not bad at all, and the fast network data lets you make the best of it. The browser doesn't support Flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 311 is well stocked as usual and things have been nicely touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day view is also available but week view has gone missing. You have various kinds of events available for setting up: reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo. The agenda, to-do and notes tabs in the calendar are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses big, touchable numbers, making it easy to set and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there's only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing features include a voice recorder with no time limit, a basic calculator and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a weather app and pre-installed Facebook and Twitter clients (combined within the Nokia Social app).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia S40 Store and bonus apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a feature phone having an app store at all is a major bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 311 owners have 40 EA games waiting for them in the Nokia Store - all for free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps is severely dumbed-down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 doesn't have a GPS receiver but Nokia Maps can use Cell-ID to get your approximate location. The app doesn't feature voice-guided navigation anyway and you can only plan pedestrian routes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, even if you hook up a Bluetooth GPS receiver to the Nokia Asha 311 it still won't function as a car SatNav. There's no option for a paid upgrade either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps are downloaded through your data connection, which is something else to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given that Nokia managed to enable pinch zooming on the resistive screen of the Asha 305, it should come as no surprise that the Asha 311 and its capacitive touchscreen support it too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The featurephone game is quite the non sequitur. It is simultaneously a vestige of a time before smartphones and a reflection of their influence - and sometimes not a very clear one at that. Yet undeniably there is market for such devices, and the Nokia Asha 311 shapes up as the likely frontrunner as the Asha series keep blurring the lines between old and new, smart and dumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 311 is not exactly the same old story of being stuck with a bottom-of-the-barrel feature phone, with a handful of extras and archaic software. As we with the Asha 305, the new S40 Touch interface has brought the Asha line closer to their smartphone brethren than ever before. And while Asha Touch is not, and never will be, up to par with what smartphones can do, it's not as big of a sacrifice - or step away, depending on where you're coming from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At roughly ?110, the 311 is by far the most expensive of the Asha series - and pretty pricey for a dumbphone, in general. The next step down in the Asha hierarchy is the dual-SIM Asha 305 which can be currently found for about ?80. It offers the same touchscreen S40 interface but trades the capacitive touchscreen for a resistive one, has less storage and RAM, as well as no 3G support and Wi-Fi connectivity. The poor camera and abysmal video recording aside, the Asha 305 is clearly less fluid and responsive than the 311. Dual-SIM support is its major highlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Asha 305</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What should worry the Asha 311 more is the serious pressure from entry-level Android smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy Y and Galaxy Pocket, along with the LG Optimus L3, each have better storage and RAM, but lower screen resolution (QVGA). These budget droids fail to offer anything exciting in terms of imaging but their main advantage is the proper OS, which is a significant step up in the software department. The Galaxy Y is available at about ?100, while the Galaxy Pocket can be had for around ?90. The LG Optimus L3 costs less than ?100 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 ? Samsung Galaxy Pocket S5300 ? LG Optimus L3 E400</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What can we say? It doesn't look too good for a dumbphone to be priced above certain smartphones. But there's more to it than just price. Chances are none of the three Android contenders will get Ice Cream Sandwich. Plus, there always seem to be too many compromises about budget smartphones. If they will need to put up with certain limitations, some people could be willing to consider an alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes the Asha 311. It isn't just another smartphone wannabe. With a nice and efficient interface, capacitive touchscreen, solid connectivity (complete with penta-band HSDPA) and Nokia Store, it looks ready to provide the alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year or so ago, Nokia would've had a Symbian smartphone running against the entry level droids. Something along the lines of the Nokia C5-03 or the Nokia 500, but the Finns seem to trust Asha Touch with that now. And it makes sense - instead of fighting a smartphone battle it just can't win, Nokia chose to focus on users who aren't willing to consider a smartphone just yet, or can only afford the most basic. Now, if those users choose to trust the Asha 311, it won't let them down.</paragraph>
