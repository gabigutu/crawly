			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E6 is Nokia?s latest business offer and it has just landed in our office. It?s the company?s first smartphone running the new Symbian Anna OS out of the box. The E6 is a touch phone with a QWERTY keyboard and it even has a higher pixel density than the iPhone?s Retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was a while since we?ve seen a high-end Nokia messenger. We are not trying to dismiss the previous E-series achievements, they?ve just became too conventional. Lucky for us the E6 brings a few interesting innovations to freshen up the lineup. It was about time!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E6 is Nokia?s first handset with VGA resolution and also Nokia?s first QWERTY bar with a touchscreen. Its pixel density is even higher than the Apple?s Retina display. The E6 doesn?t stop here though ? it packs the same camera module as most of its Symabian^3 siblings ? an 8 megapixel fixed-focus sensor capable of HD video recording. Add the new Symbian^3 update ? Anna ? and we might have a potent business or messaging phone if not else.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E6 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see the E6?s hardware is not top of the line, but we can assure you it?s perfectly fine for what it?s meant ? replacing the Nokia E71 and E72 business messengers. The new Symbian Anna has lots of optimizations and seems to work seamless inside the E6. Surely, the E6 won?t attract everyone, but it has enough features to prove worthy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia also put some work on the design and the E6 turned out to be quite a looker manufactured with premium materials. Jump on the next page to explore more about that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E6 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 similar to its E5 predecessor is on the compact side of QWERTY messengers at 115.5 x 59 x 10.5 mm. The 2.46? landscape display, large controls (soft keys, call keys, etc.), and a spacious four-row QWERTY cover most of the phone?s front. It not only measures but also weighs quite similarly to the E5 ? 133 grams ? quite normal for a solid phone with a metal body.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike Nokia E5, the E6 is definitely an attention-grabber. It?s made of premium materials, has better design, looks and even the paint seems to be better. We have to admit it?s one of the most handsome Nokia messengers we?ve encountered so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have the pleasure of the silver version and as we pointed out already it?s quite a looker. Despite its conservative paintjob, Nokia did well with designing and assembling all the stuff on the panel ? the keyboard, the display, the battery cover, the camera plate and the control deck below the screen. Despite the E6 is not a uni-body device, it might fool you easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Nokia E6 is all plastic which might occasionally get all smudgy and greasy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame around the phone, the battery cover and the camera plate are all made of metal, while matte plastic has been chosen for the upper and bottom parts of the rear panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape 2.46" 16M-color capacitive touchscreen of 640 x 480 pixel resolution takes almost half of the phone?s face. It?s Nokia?s first handset with this resolution and the first QWERTY-bar with a touchscreen. There is nothing so special with the VGA resolution, but the screen is so small that puts its pixel density on par with that of the iPhone 4?s Retina display. We managed to take accurate measures of both screens and calculated the pixel densities of both ? they turned out 326ppi for the Retina display and 325ppi for the Nokia E6 display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 has an LCD display and relies on the capacitive technology and it?s as responsive as they come. As usual it registers even the slightest touches and it?s even capable of pinch zooming (in the gallery and web browser). Its viewing angles are quite good for a regular LCD screen and the colors are vivid and accurate. People with bigger fingers might have some issues because of the combination of a small size and high resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just above the screen we find the earpiece, a bunch of useful sensors and the video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen is a spacious navigation deck built around a reasonably tactile and noticeably protruding D-pad. There are three buttons on either side of the D-pad. Call and End knobs are on both ends of the deck, the four soft keys surround the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is virtually the same as those on E5 and C3. The keys are reasonably sized with comfy shape and good tactile feedback. You shouldn?t have any problems typing with QWERTY unless you have really big fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Nokia E6 is quite crowded. The volume rocker is on top, but it?s separated with a middle key for activating the voice commands (long press) and the voice recorder (short press). Just below that trio is the typical for Nokia lock/unlock slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a lanyard eyelet at bottom end of the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock/unlock slider has another function too ? it activates the Dual-LED flash on the back of the phone to serve as a flashlight. You just slide down and hold the slider for 3s. The same action turns it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side host only the microUSB port covered with a small plastic lid. There is no USB charging though. That?s strange and we suppose it will be fixed/added further down the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top accommodates the hot-swappable microSD slot hidden under a plastic cap, the unprotected 3.5mm audio jack and the Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom hosts only the charger hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside we wind the loudspeaker grill, the dual-LED flash and the 8 megapixel fixed focus camera lens sharing a common metal plate. Unfortunately, it?s protruding and thus makes the camera lens vulnerable to scratchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the metal cover is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion BL-4D battery, which powers the Nokia E6. The battery is quoted at to 672 hours of stand-by on 2G network or up to 14 hours and 40 minutes of talk-time. Nokia PR claims the E6 is among the best battery performers on the market. We?ll have to spend some more time with the smartphone to be able to tell you if that's true, but judging by the Nokia E71 and Nokia E72 we feel that just might be the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no surprise the Nokia E6 is well built and pocket friendly QWERTY messenger bar. The keyboard and the ergonomics are top notch and the E6 offers quite a power inside. All this plus the long-lasting battery is pretty much everything you need from a business phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian Anna is finally here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The really long awaited Symbian^3 update is finally coming and we?ll get to see it conquering the already available Symbian^3 handsets later this year. Nokia E6 and X7 are the first devices to have it running out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Symbian Anna pushes the OS to the next level giving it more user-friendly and modern looking user interface, a revamped web browser, new split-screen text input view mode, better homescreen and improved Ovi Maps, Gallery, Social, Ovi Store and overall performance. In case you want to know more about the Symbian Anna you should definitely check our blog post on the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the short time we got to spend with the Nokia E6 we weren't able to do our usual tour throughout the user interface. Instead, we?ve prepared only a short demo video. Do not rush to any conclusions or pass any judgments yet (as we are not going to), because what you are about to see is yet to be improved and developed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Symbian looks better than ever and this time we finally can say it has caught with the modern tendencies ? new pop-up menus, better animations, touch-optimized menus and icons, better performance, etc. It?s the update we really waited for and we certainly hope it won?t be the last despite the fact that Nokia is heading in another direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, here?s a short video camera sample taken with the Nokia E6 camcorder. As you?ll see, the quality of the footage is as good as that of the Nokia E7 and C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been a while since last saw a hope for the Symbian OS. Nokia?s move to Windows Phone made everyone think it?s going nowhere. Well, it?s true that Symbian is a dead end, but there?s still potential and Symbian Anna promises to utilize it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 is a worthy successor of its QWERTY bar messengers and has everything to become a bestseller ? one-of-a-kind touchscreen with high resolution, excellent build quality and keyboard, a capable hardware and camcorder plus the new Symbian Anna UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia will release the E6 this quarter with a price tag of 345 euros (before taxes). That?s steep, that?s for sure and we certainly hope the company will consider a slight price cut. That way they will surely seal a lot of deals.</paragraph>
