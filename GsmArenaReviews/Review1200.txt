			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another dual-SIM phone by Nokia should be about as surprising as snow in Finland. And while we can understand it if you don't exactly brace yourselves for a shocker, being prepared won't hurt. The Nokia X2-02 has some real nice treats for all of you who like surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been nothing short of an invasion. Nokia's dual-SIMs cover every step of the entry-level segment. You can learn the ropes on the most basic S30 phones, before moving on to Touch and Type. Dual-SIM has a prominent place in the fresh Asha series too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a respectable lineup, in which the X2-02 stands out. It's not about being the best-equipped phone of the bunch. With 3G completely out of the question and cameras never crossing the 2MP mark, there's a tight limit on how much extra luggage dual-SIM phones can carry. The X2-02 gets around it by focusing on a single skill and really going the distance with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phones like the Nokia X2-02 are at the bottom of the food chain. Most of the time, a flashlight is all the extra functionality one can hope for. A 2MP fixed focus camera and blurry choppy videos are the closest to luxury you can get at this price. Dual-SIM telephony is the main course, but in the X2-02 the side dish may be just as tasty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 inherits the dedicated music controls (and the vibrant paintjobs) of the X1-01, but takes music playback to a whole new level. The built-in FM antenna lets you blast the tune playing on the radio through the powerful loudspeaker without having to plug the headphones first. The side-mounted microSD card slot is always ready to take a huge music collection, which the FM transmitter will broadcast to every radio around you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There couldn't have been more for the X1-01 to hope for. But the upgrades don't end with the added features. Take the jump to our hardware chapter, where we discover a side-mounted, hot-swappable SIM slot and a better keypad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the X2-02<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing to do is get the unboxing out of the way and the X2-02 didn't make it difficult for us. The phone comes in a small plain box with nothing but the basics: a charger, a single-piece headset and some manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card in the package, but anything less than 4GB would've been of little use anyway in a phone, which claims to be a powerful music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X2-02 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 is quite compact, although obviously not the thinnest of phones. Aesthetics are usually secondary to usability in the low end and having two card slots on either side didn't leave designers much choice. The handset is pretty much the same size as the X1-01, at 112.2 x 47.3 x 15 mm, but surprisingly is a lot lighter - just 71 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing really special about the Nokia X2-02. It looks very much like its cheaper sibling - the X1-01, but brings a few design touches and hardware upgrades to vastly improve the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got the dark silver version for review, but it's also available in bright red, orange, violet and ocean blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the display offers good enough sunlight legibility, while the alphanumeric keypad is a huge improvement over the flat numpad of the X1-01. With S40 on board, you get a proper D-pad too, with confirm action. What we don't quite like is the glossy finish of the keys, which gets easily covered in smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" QVGA display is of an unusually high quality for the low price tag of the device. Viewing angles are commendable and so is sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numpad has proper individual keys, which are comfortably shaped and solid to press. As usual with Nokia phones, the * key launches the dual SIM manager to let you define how either SIM card handles calls, texts and data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation deck is built around a four-way D-pad with a confirmation center key. There's a soft key and a call key on either side, the layout is clean and efficient. While the controls share a single flat plate, they're well-spaced and with good press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone has the single music control and the hot-swappable microSD card slot with a plastic lid. The Play/Pause key will launch the music player regardless of where you are in the interface. You can listen to your music while playing a game, writing a message or browsing the web. Not bad for a phone, which doesn't have proper multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music key will turn the radio on too if that's what you've listened to last. Since the phone has a built-in antenna, the music will instantly start playing on the loudspeaker. The FM transmitter lets you stream the music on your phone to any standard FM radio receiver in the vicinity at a frequency of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is the phone is quite busy too - it has the volume controls and the second SIM slot. The SIM compartment is hot swappable, meaning a new card inserted is instantly accessible without a reboot. Nokia call it Easy Swap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top you get the 3.5mm audio jack, the standard microUSB port and the 2mm Nokia charger plug. The X2-02 doesn't have USB charging enabled. The lanyard eyelet is the only thing at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made entirely of matte plastic and takes the whole back. The material looks sturdy and being a matte finish means it's less likely to scratch over time. Here on the back we also find the 2 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is a bit hard to open as you really have to put your nails into prying it open. Maybe the idea is that once you've placed your primary SIM (slot under the battery), you'll never need to. With side-mounted hot-swappable SIM compartment and memory slot, you won't have to look under the hood. Whatever the reason, we find the end result lacking in user friendliness. On the positive side, the cover is affixed to the body really well and it's likely that it would come off on its own even if you drop the phone. The battery cover fits super tightly, no creaks, not the slightest of wobbles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 is powered by a 1020mAh Li-Ion battery (BL-5), quoted at more than 18 days of stand-by and up to 10 hours of talk-time..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the build quality is great, although the finish is nothing to write home about. We like the matte back, but we are not fond of the glossy front. In the end, there's no risk of users feeling they're getting less than what they paid for. Perhaps the only missing feature is the flashlight we've come to know from low end Nokia phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM calling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 comes with a typical S40 phonebook, which means plenty of storage for contacts (1000 on the phone plus as many as you can fit on both SIMs) and you can choose how contacts are displayed (with contact photo, by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, that also means no smart dial but you do get search in the phone book. The phonebook can be set up to automatically store new contacts in a chosen location (phone, SIM1, SIM2) or to always ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary SIM slot on the side of the phone is hot-swappable, allowing users to quickly change SIM cards on the go, while keeping their main SIM card in the phone itself. Keep in mind that the external hot-swap SIM slot won't operate unless there's a SIM card in the master slot under the battery. So if you intend on using the handset in single SIM mode, you should use the internal slot only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make a call, you need to select which SIM the phone should use. You can set a default SIM, which will always be used for calls. Or you can have the phone prompt you to choose manually every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing and holding the * key brings up the SIM manager. Selecting a default SIM for messages works the same way so you can have one SIM for calling and the other for texting - or one for calling and texting, another for data-intensive tasks. You can also toggle the standby mode - dual SIM, or the inner SIM only. Each SIM can have its own ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 can store settings for up to 5 SIMs - each with its own name and icon. This gives you easy at-a-glance info about which SIMs are currently in use, no need to pop open the back cover or the side-mounted slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-call sound was loud and clear and the reception was solid - we didn't experience any dropped calls. The only downside of the X2-02 is that both its GSM radios are dual-band only - the 900/1800 bands are pretty wide spread, but they don't give you world-wide coverage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something to keep in mind is that if you're in a call on one SIM card, incoming calls to the second SIM will get a message that your phone is outside network, rather than getting a "busy" message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Nokia X2-02. The loudspeaker posted an Excellent result with very consistent readings for both voice and music audio - just as the Nokia ads promised.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 is a S40 6th edition device. The Active standby is the trademark homescreen layout. If you've ever used a Nokia phone, you should be familiar with it by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It divides the screen into tiles that can be scrolled with the D-pad and edited as you see fit. They can be rearranged but the default layout makes sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general indicators are on top, featuring date, time and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the end key while the keypad is locked displays a lockscreen showing the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be viewed in the traditional Grid, List or Single view modes. The left button is assigned to the Go To function by default, which brings up a list of shortcuts (you can choose which ones go up there), so that accessing the most common features is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, as a Series 40 device, the Nokia X2-02 will run Java apps so you can extend the inbuilt functionality. The Java version of Facebook's app is a good place to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 handles messaging without a problem, though with no fanfare either. The supported formats are SMS, MMS, flash and audio messages and the phone handles email too. The keyboard of the X2-02 will give you reasonable typing speed. It's a good package in terms of software support too, with Nokia Messaging and Nokia Chat enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 and multiple email accounts are supported. There's support for SSL too, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images in the gallery app, called Photos, can be viewed in either portrait or landscape mode - there's no auto-rotation though. In landscape mode, images load full screen. Photos can be organized into albums, viewed in timeline (they are ordered by the date they were taken) and sorted by date, name or size. Slideshows with selectable transition effects are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it's still here - but it's hidden in the Applications menu. It's quite a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files - both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia X2-02 has a solid set of features including a fair number of supported formats. The player handles MP3, WMA, WAV and eAAC+. Tracks can be filtered by artist, album and genre. Naturally, the A2DP profile is supported, allowing Bluetooth streaming of stereo sound. There're five equalizer presets and two slots available for custom user settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An RDS-enabled FM radio is available on the Nokia X2-02 as well and it can play through the powerful loudspeaker. Thanks to the built-on FM antenna, you can start the app almost instantly with just one key stroke (the media control on the left side of the phone). The FM radio starts playing immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an FM transmitter as well. You can configure the music player to broadcast on a pre-defined frequency and get your music playing in your car cable-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the Nokia X2-02 supports MP4, H.264, H.263 and 3GP. Let's face it, watching a movie on this small low-res display is not exactly pleasurable but will work. Playing the occasional clip someone sent you via MMS is as much use as this player might be getting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, and you get pause and skip buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 comes with the familiar Nokia web browser. Its start screen has the usual URL and search bars and three side-scrollable panes below, which are quite reminiscent of the Symbian homescreen (complete with the three dots at the bottom that indicate the current pane).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From left to right, the panes are History, Featured (lists popular sites in several categories) and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One excellent new feature is the autosuggestions as you type in the URL - it lists recently visited sites and filters the list as you type. It even offers to save you a few clicks by guessing the ".com" at the end - Symbian^1 users can only wish their browser can do these things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser uses the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quickly (even on EDGE) and don't waste much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is not great by a longshot, but it's a cheap phone so we really can't start criticizing the phone here. The thing works just fine and will do the job most of the time - this is the most important for the X2-02.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is pretty good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are used to seeing entry level Nokia handsets punch above their weight in our audio quality test. The Nokia X2-02 is no exception, providing pretty clean audio output, despite its lowly standing in the pecking order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia X2-02 got great scores just about everywhere, marking nicely clean output. Its volume levels are quite high, too, so it's among the better performers we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play you notice a moderate amount of degradation. Stereo crosstalk increases by an average or just above average amount, distortion shoots up to levels that should be worrying the most demanding users a bit and frequency response worsens slightly. The X2-02 is hardly perfect here, but if your earlobes aren't trained it will sound almost as good as perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic 2MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 comes with a fixed-focus 2MP camera that takes photos at maximum resolution of 1600x1200. There are options for white balance, several effects and a self-timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's little point in talking about image quality, besides saying it's awful. The colors and contrast are OK, but the resolved detail is poor and the noise reduction makes the end result even worse. We still wonder what happened with those old 2MP cameras (Samsung D600, anyone?) which produced such nice photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here are a few camera samples to give you an idea of what we're dealing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera is limited to QCIF@10fps, which makes them usable for MMS only and practically nothing else. Here's a video sample. It's a really awful one as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia have always been on top of things in the organizer department. The Calendar is the full-featured app we should all be familiar with by now. It has month, week, and day modes and five types of events to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected day of the week, even when the phone is switched off. The other organizing features available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02's calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition, a loan calculator is also available. The consistently useful unit converter tops the list of additional applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 also includes Notes, Countdown timer, To-Do List and World Clock apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're not sure whether anyone looking for a dual-SIM phone cares about the music-playing skills. Alternatively, the presumably younger crowd drawn by the impressive audio package is probably not too interested in dual-SIM telephony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever the case, the Nokia X2-02 doesn't pose a dilemma for users. In fact, the price tag implies no hard choices. A cheap phone, that handles two SIM cards and is a great music player, is more likely to be popular with different groups of people rather than fail to find its target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 phones do well - they don't usually offer big surprises, but that keeps the disappointments to a minimum too. They don't charge a fortune either. The X2-02 is a great example. It's cheap because it offers a very basic set of features. But it's cheap too because it didn't cost much to design and build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-02 is based on two older entry level phones and, amazingly, it doesn't cost more than either of them at launch. The X1-01 is the dual-SIM prototype, while the X2 has the Xpress Music pedigree. Now, we're not sure whether anyone coming from either of those will consider the X2-02 as an upgrade. Nokia must be taking account of the fact though that the demand for even the most basic of phones is slowly getting more sophisticated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia X1-01 &#x2022; Nokia X2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have been busy expanding their entry-level lineup and dual-SIM phones are a major niche for them. They've been so prolific lately that you may find it hard to believe that Samsung have about twice as many dual-SIM phones to offer - and that's not counting the touchphones and smartphones that come with dual-SIM telephony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung C3322 is an almost exact match for the Nokia X2-02. Sure it doesn't have the built-in antenna and an FM transmitter but it's a truly worldwide phone with quad-band support for both SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung C3322</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E1232B is another fairly recent phone, which however has a lot less to offer. It's a basic package, the flashlight kind, in the same vein as the Nokia X1-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung E1232B</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of choice in Nokia's own backyard too. The Asha 200 is one that we quite liked. That's where it gets really hard to choose though: a dual-SIM QWERTY messenger or a dual-SIM music player. We guess both will enjoy robust demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Asha 200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, they both show that Nokia's dual SIMs are well beyond the most basic calling and texting, with multiple phonebooks to accommodate phone sharing within the family. The X2-02 is not that kind of phone. Unless it's your music you want to share.</paragraph>
