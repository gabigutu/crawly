			<paragraph>We called it a game for the Diamond and Omnia but the crowd is still on their feet, so there we go with the HTC Diamond's lap of honor. The latest HTC squad member, HTC Touch Diamond, might as well be starting a new era for Microsoft OS-powered mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never before has Windows Mobile looked this sharp, nor has it been as feature-loaded. Gem-inspired design, VGA screen, GPS and a built-in accelerometer might just be enough to get WinMo fans exited but the HTC Touch Diamond reaches beyond. A usable 3 megapixel camera and the latest edition of the TouchFLO UI are running on the brand new 6.1 version of the Windows Mobile Professional OS. And all that is packed into a package that's as compact as they get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already saw the Diamond in action - and up against some cutthroat competition. It now has the spotlight all to itself and we're about to see if it's got the diamond-hard performance to become a true blockbuster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's rather hard to find a Windows mobile device to boast the same extras as the Diamond and be just as pocket-friendly. The compact size of the HTC Touch Diamond and the VGA screen are its best ammo in the market share war.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already stood the HTC Touch Diamond against the other most interesting WinMo device to recently surface - the Samsung i900 Omnia. You can replay the PocketPC championship game here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alongside the Omnia, there are a couple of other devices to fight the HTC Touch Diamond for a place under the sun. Here are a few alternatives to check out before cashing out for the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eten glofiish X900 has virtually the same feature pack as the HTC Touch Diamond, although it weighs a good 37 grams more. However, it packs quad-band GSM and tri-band UMTS (with HSDPA), which might make all the difference for frequent travelers. The glofiish V900 is another interesting offer by Eten not to be overlooked, especially with that built-in DVB-H/DVB-T/T-DMB/DAB TV broadcast receiver in mind. Neither of Eten devices however has hit the shelves, so we are yet to see if their performance is a match for the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few members of the Gigabyte g-Smart lineup also feature VGA screens and comparably lightweight bodies. i350, t600 and MW998 are a few names that come to mind. We doubt it however that the PocketPCs manufactured by the relatively less popular GigaByte can be considered as a serious rival of the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now if you have already gone through the HTC Touch Diamond and Samsung i900 Omnia head-to-head article you are probably wondering if this review is worth your time. Well, truthfully, we have put our every effort to make it worth it:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So basically, we really hope that you would enjoy this detailed review as much as you enjoy most of our articles here at GSMArena. Well, if we've got you interested enough, hit this small jump for more on the HTC Touch Diamond.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most notable thing about the HTC Touch Diamond retail package is its shape. It's a reverse truncated pyramid. Made of the same glossy plastic as the phone, the lid of the box is the best warning of what to expect in terms of fingerprint issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as contents are concerned we aren't really impressed. Now don't get us wrong - we aren't that disappointed but we expected some sort of a pleasant surprise inside the flagship's box. Well, it failed to deliver. On the other hand, that might as well be for the better, keeping the HTC Touch Diamond cost down. As for those keen to accessorize their handset, HTC have launched a whole series of nice little extras for the Diamond that can be purchased separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cutting to the point, the list of items in the Diamond's box is not too long: a rather under-par wired handset, a spare stylus and a CD with software of arguable use. The headphones really aren't much to our liking with really low bass levels. There is also a bunch of leaflets and guides, along with a catalog of available accessories to order. Finally, a screen protector is included to help protect your precious handset from scratches.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Diamond 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Diamond's dimensions of 102 x 51 x 11.5mm make it one of (if not the most) compact PocketPCs ever made. There isn't any other Windows Mobile powered device to match its thickness and only a few have a weight of less than 110g. It's no problem to stick the Diamond in virtually any pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have seen the preview you would know that we weighed the HTC Touch Diamond on digital scales in our office. The reading of only 103 g still has us wondering where the difference came from.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond design is quite impressive. The gem-inspired back panel and the glossy front do make up one slick looker of a handset. However, it's quite noticeable that in reality the Touch Diamond is not pitch black as those HTC ads suggest. At a certain angle of light, the front panel actually turns bluish grey, much like the HTC Touch Cruise display frame. This gives it a bit cheaper looks, though it's not really that big a deal. You can clearly see that effect on some of the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, the usual problem with glossy panels stands with the Diamond too -fingerprints do make it a mess. Even the shortest time of using the device is enough to get it all covered with smudges and ruin the otherwise great looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is dominated by the 2.8" screen of the exciting VGA resolution. While not exactly a novelty among PocketPCs, the VGA screen is really one of the highlights of the HTC Touch Diamond. We'll be back discussing the qualities of the display in more detail a little later in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the secondary video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front panel is taken by the four hardware soft keys and the special scroll wheel/D-pad combo. The regular keys feel somewhat cheap and fail to provide enough press feedback. We wish HTC did better here, after all the Diamond is expected to top their non-QWERTY lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, HTC do deserve credit for finding room for a back key on the Diamond. It gets you one screen back wherever you are in the Diamond interface and though this might seem the simplest of things, it is missing in other WinMo devices. In the Diamond, it's a real boost to user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is a bit of a let down. It combines the regular 5-way functionality with a touch sensitive overlay to use as a scroll wheell. The touch-sensitive scroll wheel can be used for zooming on images, web pages, messages, and doubles as music controls. It is basically the same as the HTC Touch Cruise scroll wheel, only in touch disguise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem we are having with it, is that pressing the D-pad rather frequently results in an accidental press of one of the other keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the Diamond there is only the power key, which is also used for toggling the standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is completely bereft of controls, the only thing to see there is the "4GB internal storage" label. A dedicated shutter key would've been welcome. Instead, the HTC R&amp;D team chose to leave that to the D-pad. The dual focus-and-shoot action is all there: a tap on the touch-sensitive D-pad counts as half-press, while pushing the confirming center is a full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Diamond we find the volume rocker, which is large enough and comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the miniUSB port for connecting the data cable, charger and the headphones. The other thing to note here is the stylus compartment, which scores another point for the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're tucking the stylus back in, you don't need to push all the way down. The slot is magnetic and it literally pulls the stylus in. The stylus is active, so when you take it out, the phone automatically resumes from standby. Furthermore, taking out the stylus during a call automatically activates the Notes applications, so you can quickly put down a phone number for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is where designers were definitely not on a short leash. However, functionality has been sacrificed for the sake of cool looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the gem-patterned back side renders the handset impossible to operate when laid on a table. It wobbles annoyingly and that makes touch-operating it rather tricky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The uneven surface causes another problem with the backside of the Diamond. The few edges that stick out are way more vulnerable to the day-to-day wear and tear than the rest of the rear. In only a week or two of having the Diamond, those edges got really worn and bruised, which has a really negative impact on the looks of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing to see rearside is the 3 megapixel camera lens. There is no flash whatsoever, so low-light shooting with the Diamond is out of the question. Furthermore, the camera lens is covered by a thin layer of plastic, which is an inherent part of the battery cover. This protective layer is obviously not crystal clear, resulting in poor photo quality. The best demonstration of that is comparing pictures taken with the rear cover on and off. Such a comparison lies in store in the camera chapter of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 900 mAh Li-ion battery that powers the HTC Touch Diamond. Having a demanding VGA screen powered by a battery of this caliber won't make wonders in terms of battery life but still the Diamond isn't a terrible performer. It manages to deliver about a full day under heavy usage which is on the verge of passable by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also managed about three days of stand-by in a 3G network when not used excessively. We had left it be for a while but this will hardly be the case with any Diamond owner. In our dedicated GPS battery test the HTC Touch Diamond managed the unimpressive 2 hours and 20 minutes before its battery went dead flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good news to potential Diamond owners is that the company recently announced an extended battery pack for the phone, featuring the far more reasonable 1350 mAh. It will add some thickness and weight to the Diamond but to some users the sacrifice might just be worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the build quality of the HTC Touch Diamond leaves mixed impressions. It's one looker of a handset but the quickly wearing edges at the back and the fingerprint issues just can't be overlooked. It does make up for some of that with size and handling.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Diamond is equipped with a 2.8" 65K-color screen of VGA resolution. Riding on the immense pixel-to-inch ratio, the Diamond offers remarkable picture quality. Here's the quick math: Nokia N95 8GB has the same sized screen, featuring only a quarter of the Diamond's pixels. This makes the Diamond one of the few PocketPCs out there to not let you down in terms of picture quality. Instead, it is comparable to some of the best displays on the market - quite an achievement for HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many would make a case of the Diamond's 65K-color support "only". But hey, there aren't really that many cases when the difference between 65K and 16M colors is visible to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside of the HTC Diamond display is sunlight legibility. It really isn't the best device to work with in the bright sun. It's a tad better than its predecessor - the HTC Touch Cruise - but still qualifies for an average score only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another potential problem with the Diamond's display is its proneness to scratches. We did inflict a couple of them in only two weeks of using the Diamond, and we're just not a bunch of careless sods.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting around is easy enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Diamond has a hardware Home key to comfortably take you to the TouchFLO Home tab every time you press it. Another extra handy control is the Back key. Now, PocketPCs usually don't have any Back keys (we can't quite remember a PocketPC that has one) and the "going a step/screen back" logic is not implemented in Windows Mobile either. So we were pleasantly surprised by the cunning Back key on the HTC Diamond, which never fails to get you back to the previous screen no matter what application you are using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch sensitive scroll wheel is another nice navigation tool - unfortunately it's only used in a limited number of applications. You can use it when zooming in/out on images, zooming in/out inside the web browser and zooming in/out on emails and SMS/MMS. The last application where the scroll wheel is used is the Music player where you can fast forward and rewind with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic screen rotation thanks to the built-in accelerometer is a nice feature to Windows Mobile devices. Screen rotation has been implemented in these handsets ever since Windows Mobile 5 surfaced several years ago, but doing it automatically had obviously never occurred to engineers. And once again - it's the iPhone that changed the industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, there were some handsets with built-in accelerometers even before the iPhone, however their built-in sensors were not used for auto rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the auto screen rotation feature on the HTC Touch Diamond works only in selected applications such as Photos and Videos and the web browser, and you can't turn the feature off. Of course, there is a free third-party solution for that, but there will be more on it in the Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review (tip: it's near the end, just before the conclusion).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New generation TouchFLO<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are keen on Windows Mobile devices, you're probably familiar by now with the HTC Touch and the HTC Touch Cruise interpretation of TouchFLO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the HTC Touch it was a launcher application in the form of a cube, controlled via finger sweeps. To that the HTC Touch Cruise added finger scrolling in applications such as Contacts, Messaging, Internet Explorer Mobile. Users can also enjoy some fancy image flipping and zooming in the custom image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, HTC Touch Diamond brings all that a level up - meet the TouchFLO 3D. It does offer those same things as the HTC Touch Cruise, adding however some extra cool looking Home screen that just begs to finger flip it to the right and left, and up and down. It's fluid, it's all eye candy, and you've already probably seen enough of it online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No offence, but the eye-opener device for most mobile manufacturers is the Apple iPhone. Its fluid, almost physical, all-touch UI showed us all what we were missing. And we are not talking specs here - HS(uper)D(uper)PA, umpteen-megapixel shooters with auto-hocus-pocus and a bunch of other acronyms that make a geek's heart melt. We are talking unsurpassed control, user-friendliness and sweet simplicity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since the thunderbolt of iPhone descended upon the industry, full touch-based devices and highly touch optimized applications have been spawning all over the place. Well, today we look at one of the finest examples of this welcome trend - the TouchFLO 3D courtesy of the HTC Touch Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just so you know, for this review we are running our Touch Diamond on the latest ROM version available: 1.37.707.1. It's a standard ROM with no system tweaks applied. We have to note that we didn't find the TouchFLO 3D on older ROM much slower than the new one. The TouchFLO 3D is pretty responsive once you learn the various ways to control it and it only lags when for some reason you switch to the underlying Windows interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tab upon tab - it's TouchFLO home screen, sugar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D Home screen offers a choice of full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the tab thumbnails at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need. The list is long and includes the home screen (with a large clock), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, photos and video, music, weather, settings and a customizable application launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, in case you've missed it here's an official HTC TouchFLO 3D demo to check out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>
showVideo("http://cdn.gsmarena.com/vv/reviewsimg/htc-diamond-vs-samsung-omnia/", "touch_diamond_gettingstarted.flv", 320, 480);
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's have a closer look at those tabs. A nice thing is that each tab comes with its own set of context keys, but the downside is that those are not customizable to suit your needs. With the TouchFLO 3D at hand, you would rarely have to resort to using the Windows built-in interface (except for file browsing and setting the alarm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than showing the clock, the Home tab gives you access to the HTC Call log, Windows World clock, Windows Alarm application, windows calendar application - in case you have pending events for the day, they too get listed here. The context keys give you access to the Phone Pad and the TouchFLO Programs tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the second TouchFLO tab called People, you can set favorite contacts, which would be displayed with their assigned images or, in case you haven't set those, a generic image. You can scroll images with a finger sweep. A tap on the photo will give you the contact's details, while a tap on the number below the image will automatically dial it. You can scroll the favorite contacts by using the thumbnail bar on the right too. The context keys give you access to the regular Windows Mobile contact list or several settings for managing favorite contacts, such as remove or change picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab shows your latest SMS/MMS. A single finger sweep displays the next message. A small shortcut in the top right corner will automatically start a new SMS/MMS with the default Windows message editor. The context keys will give you access to the Windows Mobile SMS/MMS inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email tab shows your emails in an attractive way and, again, you can flip through them one by one. The number of unread emails appears on the right. A dedicated shortcut starts a new email. The context keys give you access to the Windows Mobile Email inbox, as well several commands such as Send/Receive or Email Account management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet tab launches the Opera 9.5 web browser or the slick preinstalled YouTube video client. You can also scroll your bookmarks and launch one directly from there. The first context key displays all of your bookmarks but this time within the browser, while the second one? starts the browser. HTC must have lost their focus setting up this tab. A shortcut to the preinstalled RSS reader and streaming media player would have been much nicer. There's no option either for changing the default Opera browser and there's no way to type a URL directly on the Home screen and open it in the browser. Now those are just some ideas that came up in a minute or so - so next time when you guys over at HTC lose your inspiration, drop us a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos and Video tab quite obviously gives you access to your images and video files. You can scroll them with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here. It's pretty much the easiest way to do it, as there is no dedicated camera key. The context keys give you access to the Album application, which is used for viewing all your images and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab displays albums with their covers and you can flip through them much like you would on the iPhone and its gorgeous Cover Flow. The context keys let you access the music player options and the music player library where you can sort your music based on other filters beside album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab is again self explanatory but it easily amazes with its graphics. You can check the weather in several locations and you can alternate them with a finger sweep. You can also get a 5-day forecast for these locations via the first context key. The second context key allows you to manage the locations, for which the weather will be monitored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Settings and it lets you control various system options saving you the effort of using the confusing Windows Mobile Settings page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, you can set the ringing profile, volume level and ringtone all from one central place. Now, that's really handy. Even pressing the volume rocker brings up a fancy custom-made fullscreen slider instead the usual WinMo mini sliders. The original Windows Mobile sound settings are accessible from here too and are listed under Advanced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have access to the HTC custom Communications manager, which handles all on-board transceivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have even created the so-called System status screen, which gets invoked when you touch the icons on the top of the Home screen. Those status icons are usually too tiny to press accurately with a finger and normally you would need the stylus to check the battery status (by touching the battery indicator), regulate volume (by touching the speaker icon), or open the communications manager or phone and connectivity settings (by touching the signal indicator or network type icon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the System status screen, once you touch the area of those icons with your big finger, all of them get listed fullscreen so you can easily pick the one you want. It's an extra step but it's nice nonetheless!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the last tab is the customizable Application launcher where you can set shortcuts to the most frequently used features. Using the context keys you can also open a finger scrollable list of all programs currently installed on your device. The list is dynamic, so as soon as you add new apps, it gets updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that pretty much gets all of them covered. We guess, it's been a long reading and that alone should hint you that the number of tabs is a bit too much. Some of them are totally redundant, such as the Internet tab, while others could have been merged in one - such as SMS and email. There are people that don't use email on their mobile, so basically our biggest grudge against the TouchFLO 3D interface is that you can't select which tabs will be shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that thanks to a third-party software solution, you can re-order and, if necessary, hide some of the Home screen tabs. But there'll be more on it in the dedicated Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Making your way around Windows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get past the Home screen and all the finger sweeps and animations though, all you are left with is muddy waters of the not-so-thumbable Microsoft OS. We are not against Windows Mobile by any means, however having to poke about your device with a little stick called stylus is so 1990s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC however have made some efforts to tweak up the core Windows usability too. Some of the most used system settings, contacts management, and the messaging department have all benefited, and so have image and web browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contact management is even easier<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have unlimited contacts list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. However, the small font and tiny fields make the stylus a must when you are searching a contact or editing its details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC offer the default WinMo contacts list, however they have added thumb scrolling courtesy of TouchFLO (a slower sweep scrolls them gradually, while a fast single sweep scrolls the whole list from top to bottom). Secondly, you can pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right. Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact you have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance, those are not enough, you can always rename some of the existing ones and use them instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the long list of available fields, when viewing a contact's details, only those that are actually filled show up. A really nice feature is the Last call details that appear alongside every contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is usually a priority for every cell phone - that still holds true for smart devices such as the HTC Diamond. Some users report sound quality issues during calls with the HTC Diamond. We however didn't experience any, it was flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list in order to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you put the Diamond to your ear, the display automatically switches off to avoid accidental presses. To do so, it doesn't rely on a proximity sensor like the iPhone, but uses the embedded light sensor instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside to that is you need to press the On/Off key to turn the display back on during the call. But once you do, it stays on until you've finished your conversation. If however you don't like that solution, you are welcome to check out the Tweaks &amp; Modding section of this review for a quick remedy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC Touch Diamond an extra cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself. At least, it's unlikely to get your calls muted accidentally in your pocket - the feature is so set up that it's more likely to not engage at all, rather than engage for no reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that if the Diamond is already face down when a call comes in, the feature won't be available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond boast two more user-friendly features that make call management even better. First of all, pulling out the active stylus during a call will automatically turn the display on and launch the Notes application. It even puts down the call details (the other party name and the time of call) on the note for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And secondly, the HTC Diamond comes with a feature that's available on many feature phones - reject call with SMS. When you reject a call, the handset automatically sends the rejected caller a preset text message. We've never found that particularly useful, since you may have a dozen of different reasons to reject a call and there's hardly a universal message text that can cater to them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with the HTC Touch Diamond, the SMS is not sent automatically. Instead you are prompted to review and possibly edit the template before dispatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. HTC have pimped the looks of the regular WinMo calls log and have added thumb scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To conclude the phone part review of the Diamond, we measured the loudspeaker performance as part of our reviewing routine. You surely won't miss any calls with it, as it's loud enough to score the Good mark. Here's how the HTC Touch Diamond ranks along several other smart devices. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor. Thanks to TouchFLO you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and longer messages. Dynamic font resizing (zooming in/out with the scroll wheel) is also at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of Windows 6.1, users enjoy threaded SMS, so you can be sure you get that feature on the Touch Diamond. Also, contrary to what some users report, the HTC Touch Diamond DOES offer Message delivery reports in its Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly debated feature of the Touch Diamond concerns receiving SMS in standby mode. When a message comes in, the handset only produces a tone with no vibration. The SMS alert doesn't wake up the device either - it stays in standby mode. We find that a perfectly usable solution and we don't object at all. Furthermore, the scroll wheel backlight blinks at regular intervals to alert you of an unread message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox holds no surprises to experienced WinMo users. A nice upgrade is the dynamic zooming with the scroll wheel, which is available when you are reading an email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the Touch Diamond. HTC have equipped the device with a set of home-grown thumbable virtual keyboards. It's a commendable feature since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are fit for stylus use only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first keyboard is full QWERTY, the second one is a Blackberryesque QW-ER-TY one and, finally, the third one is a regular 9-key multi-tap keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the applications where screen auto rotation is enabled, you also get larger landscape versions of those keyboards. Unfortunately, the web browser is the only place where screen rotation is available and there's any use of typing. Sorry folks, no landscape typing on the Diamond. It's strange that HTC haven't taken care of that, given it was one of the harshest criticisms of the Apple iPhone. Plus, they had access to almost a year's worth of iPhone user feedback freely available online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, thanks again to third-party app developers, users now have more control over the screen rotation feature and that has made landscape typing possible. You can read more about it in the dedicated Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia management and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond offers generous amount of storage - the 4GB available may probably make up for the lack of a memory card slot for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the lack of a card slot might be an issue for those who have purchased software that ships on a memory card and that can be run only from that memory card - most GPS navigation applications are a good example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the read/write performance of the Touch Diamond both against software benchmarks and in real life tasks. Both tests gave similar results so we are publishing only the real-life one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We concluded our real-life test on a Windows XP-based PC paired with the Diamond in USB Mass Storage mode. Overall, it showed really nice results in the Read operation (copying from handset to PC). However the Write operation was three times slower. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that those figures will be lower on a Vista-based PC for some Microsoft-only-knows-why reason. That's another story entirely and we'd rather stay out of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>That's an excellent image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond offers a nice thumbnail browser straight from the Photos and Videos tab on the Home screen. There's another thumbnail browser in the Album app available from the context menu on the Home screen or the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the image is opened, you can make use of the auto screen rotation feature to view it in landscape mode or you can zoom in with a circular gesture on the display (it's TouchFLO, baby) or on the scroll wheel. Once you zoom in on the image you can start panning by holding your thumb down for a second, or you can use the D-pad. The Albums application also offers a customizable slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling to the next image is a matter of a single finger sweep and it's almost instantaneous. The image viewer actually has the same functionality as in the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, switching to landscape mode is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got to be said that the Touch Diamond has a certain advantage over competing devices when it comes to image browsing since this is one of the applications where VGA does count big time. The images look great on the high resolution screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And there's an iPod-style music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond has a good music player, which makes heavy use of album art. The music player is accessible straight from the TouchFLO home screen with cool Apple-like cover flow animation for you to pick an album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other criteria beside album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and stunningly reminiscent of iPhone's very own music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no 3.5mm audio jack on the Diamond or on its headphones, so unless you get hold of a third-party adapter, you're stuck with the supplied headset, which - simply put - sucks. The headset does look good, but listening to music is not among its strengths - it's best left for making phone calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile devices have never been known for even decent audio output. Their business mindset has so far served as a good excuse for the poor audio. However, since the Diamond is now considered a multimedia device as well, it is about time this changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, in reality it's arguably up to the task in terms of audio quality. The HTC has some nice IMD and THD levels but somewhat fails in terms of frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems as though HTC have put some sort of high-pass filter in the Touch Diamond, hence the frequency response graph you can see posted below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you can see for yourselves that the Diamond is nevertheless a real step up in audio quality from previous Windows mobile devices we have tested. Anyway, they are still behind the best music phone standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond and Apple iPod frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's an FM radio, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Diamond built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in. As we already told you however, you would be better off using a third-party headset with some sort of 3.5mm audio adapter, as the original set is not well suited for listening to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the Touch Diamond FM radio has an excellent interface much like the rest of the multimedia players on board and offers memory for some 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Portable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond has a nice video player but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to Windows. To enjoy a more versatile video support on the Diamond (DiVX or XViD for example), you will probably need to purchase a dedicated video player, which has support for more file types than the stock variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We resorted to the well-known Core player, since the free TCPMP player didn't run on the handset, probably due to some compatibility issues with Windows Mobile 6.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Diamond is pretty good at near VGA-res XviD video playback - we played an XviD encoded DVD rip for PC playback and, luckily, there were no skipped frames. Credit probably goes to the dedicated graphics chip. We are glad that HTC have finally sorted the video performance issues that plagued the Touch Cruise and the TyTN II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond VGA display did count here: the video looked excellent, well ahead of other devices. We guess the Diamond is a sealed deal for movie aficionados if display size doesn't bother them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: not worth the fuss<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It lacks a dedicated camera key so, in order to pre-focus before you snap a picture with the Diamond, you simply touch the touch-sensitive D-pad. Once focus is locked, you can take the picture by pressing the confirm button of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond camera also lacks a LED flash, but our team is hardly fond of LED flashes, so we don't count this as a serious flaw.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interface and features </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond viewfinder is free of any overlaying controls by default but you can display those by touching the display once, while in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC Touch Diamond is regularly equipped and offers the standard self-timer, white balance presets, as well as color effects, and a viewfinder gridline. You can shoot images with the front-facing video-call camera too and there's some nice custom resolution setting for contacts' images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest letdown, when it comes to features, is that the camera lacks geotagging. Why that's left out is beyond us. Nevertheless, we have found a free third-party fix for that, but we'll discuss it in the Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review (tip: it's getting closer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Touch Diamond you can shoot macro images easily without changing modes or anything. However focusing in close-ups is rather hard and is more of a hit-or-miss - sometimes the Touch Diamond focuses correctly, while other times it's way off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a panorama mode that offers on-screen framing guidance. After all the individual shots for the panorama are taken, the Diamond stitches the images automatically. The downside here is that in Panorama mode each individual image is shot at roughly 480 x 480 pixels. Plus, images are badly stitched. Obviously the Panorama mode is only ok if you intend to show your images on the handset display exclusively (which is exactly 480 pixels wide) with no further zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one great construction fault of the HTC Touch Diamond camera, which renders all produced images mediocre. It may sound surprising but it's the little plastic lens cover that comes as a part of the gem-shaped back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It stands right in front of the camera lens and even when perfectly cleaned, it reduces both the contrast and the resolved detail of all photos and especially those of backlit subjects. It's the same fault the iPhone suffers but, luckily, here we can remove the back cover and do some comparative shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the back cover on, the Diamond camera produces images, which are well bellow the average level for a 3 megapixel camera on a mobile phone. The only good thing we can say about it is that it at least lacks the strange maze artifacts, exhibited by earlier versions of the Touch Cruise and TyTN II cameras, that appeared all over uniformly colored areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the back cover removed, the Touch Diamond photos take another shape. Contrast and the resolved detail increase noticeably and images turn out quite obviously better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shot with the cover on:     Shot with the cover off:   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out some other photo samples from the Diamond, all taken the regular way - with the back cover on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond video capturing capabilities are not impressive by any means. All you get is CIF recording (352 x 288 pixel) at 30fps. It's not that bad: after all the VideoCD standard uses that resolution, but it's nowhere near what you would expect in a high-end smart device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles the one of the still camera. You can only adjust the white balance, the resolution and brightness and finally add some color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video produced by the Touch Diamond. It's an MPEG4 recording in CIF resolution at 30fps - the maximum that the device offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity and web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond offers excellent connectivity options - HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi and stereo Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR are all on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond has only tri-band GSM and dual-band HSDPA support, however it will have two localized versions to cover markets world-wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 support is also present of course and every time you plug in the USB cable the Diamond prompts selecting between ActiveSync and USB Mass Storage connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Touch Diamond lacks a memory card slot, which proves quite an inconvenience for many users especially those that have or are about to purchase applications that ship on a memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is really good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond is equipped with the latest version of the Opera browser, which makes the Internet Explorer Mobile redundant. The Opera 9.5 browser is extensively touch-optimized and seems heavily inspired by the iPhone Safari browser. However it's such a new piece of software, that there isn't even a public beta available to other PocketPC users. That alone should tell you that the web browser is in for some early development bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond VGA resolution display snatches a point again in the web browsing department. When the browser loads the full website preview, the minute text still remains recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it fails to deliver the same level of usability as the Safari browser, the Opera 9.5 makes up for it by throwing in a few features that totally lack on the iPhone, such as text copy/paste, Flash Lite 3 support and a download manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, when you zoom in the browser wraps the text, so the content fits the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Touch Diamond offers automatic screen rotation inside the web browser, the Opera 9.5 is pretty much the only place where a landscape QWERTY keyboard is available for text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a few words about the Opera 9.5 interface. By default web pages are opened fullscreen free of any overlaying controls. A tap on the bottom right corner however brings up the available controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher, the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one drawback we've noticed on the Diamond implementation and the reason probably lies in the early development stage of the Opera 9.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here it goes - at times trying to pan a web page makes the web browser just zoom in or out without any logical reason. That behavior can be a real bugger and we hope they fix it in some of the next software updates.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with MS Outlook. As of Windows Mobile 6.0, the Calendar allows browsing the events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. You can also hide weekends from the Calendar if you use it for business strictly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder and Calculator go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the little customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your mobile office is here too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of the Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the VGA display of the Diamond proves superior in fitting as much of the documents contents as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the Diamond in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search software, capable of searching throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The whole nine yards of software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond comes loaded with additional third-party software to meet various Windows Mobile user needs. It's got regular stuff such as the RSS Reader and Streaming Media manager, but it has some really original applications to go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's nice of HTC to have preinstalled a Task Manager on the Diamond. Unfortunately, it's only available via the TouchFLO homescreen interface upon a tap in the top right corner. We would have liked it better if the Task Manager was available across the Windows Mobile interface too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSSHub app is an RSS reader for staying abreast of the latest news and content at your favorite web places. The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Diamond also ships with the MP3 Trimmer app. It allows you to crop MP3 tracks to make your own ringtones. Another goodie is the Remote Desktop Mobile client. It allows you to connect remotely to any Windows-based computer. It's a really handy feature that - if you ask us - should come preinstalled on all PocketPCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the Diamond impresses with the amusing Teeter game, which puts the built-in accelerometer to good use. Navigating a ball around a maze of holes became a favorite pastime of our team members. Teeter easily impresses with its polished graphics and the handset even produces well-balanced vibrations each time your ball hits the walls of the maze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, kudos to HTC for the excellent YouTube client, which offers a fluid and excellent looking interface - even better than the one on iPhone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Diamond features a built-in GPS receiver - it's the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, which comes along with the Qualcomm 7200A platform. It's the same chipset used in earlier HTC models such as the HTC TyTN II and the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Diamond doesn't have a GPS navigation application pre-installed, so you have to purchase one separately. With a dedicated GPS app installed, it performed admirably as an in-car navigation unit. When it comes to displaying maps on screen, the Touch Diamond's VGA display is a clear advantage. It offers much more detail than the iPhone for example at a relatively the same level of magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick head-to-head comparison using the free Google Maps for Mobile app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are pretty happy with the GPS sensitivity of the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, the same doesn't go to its energy efficiency. The competing SiRF Star III chipset is much better at that. And coupled with the small capacity battery and the high-res display, the Diamond can't simply offer much power autonomy with the GPS switched on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a dedicated GPS battery test to see how far you can get with the Touch Diamond in GPS mode. It ran out of juice after 2 hours and 20 minutes of full satellite lock in still position. You should bear in mind that in a moving vehicle those numbers will be lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just for the sake of comparison, the HTC Touch Cruise and the HTC TyTN II lasted about 3.5 - 4 hours in this same test. The Asus P750 with its SiRF Star III chipset however managed to outshine them all by a good margin - it kept going for 6 hours straight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And we've finally reached the real fun part of this review - at least for us, that is. PocketPCs have long been the target of custom modding, patching and tweaking. HTC for one have an especially wide and busy fan base that seems to be constantly poking and prodding for a new twist to their gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Touch Diamond review will not be complete without mentioning some of the achievements on the user customization and modding scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's the screen auto rotation limitations that HTC have imposed on the Diamond. By default, screen auto rotation only works in the web browser, image gallery and video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gsen app for the Touch Diamond makes automatic screen rotation available almost all across the interface - except for the Home screen. An added bonus is that turning the handset down on a flat surface automatically switches it to standby. Screen auto rotation is incredibly responsive, so we are mighty pleased. You can find more about Gsen here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Diamond TF3D Config app that allows you to tweak the Home screen tabs - you can hide the unneeded ones or freely re-order the current setup. It works nice and deals with our biggest grudge against the TouchFLO 3D Home screen - lack of customizability. You can find more about the Diamond TF3D Config here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Improved Comm Manager for Diamond enhances the current functionality of the Diamond's very own without compromising looks. You can find more about the Improved Comm Manager for Diamond here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the SMS Tweaker you can fine tune the default messaging font size, you can toggle the threaded SMS mode on and off, or you can apply custom backgrounds to SMS boxes. Though the SMS Tweaker is not an application exclusive to Diamond but developed for WinMo 6.1, it runs flawlessly on the Touch Diamond. You can find more about the SMS Tweaker here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Diamond Profile Switcher you can toggle the ringer profiles on the Diamond with the help of the built-in accelerometer. A simple shake switches between "volume on" or "silent with vibration on" profiles. If nothing else, it's a rather fun way to handle this routine task. You can find more about the Diamond Profile Switcher here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a whole list of other customizable options that require you to edit the Windows Mobile system registry. For example, you can set the Diamond to wake up on an incoming SMS, enable geotagging, or unlock hidden camera modes, such as Burst or Sport. You can also control stuff like TouchFLO scroll speed or the turn-over-to-mute feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list is long and it keeps growing, as more users give in to the Diamond allure and keenly mess around with its system settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But instead of copying everything over, here's a useful source of information that has most of the available registry tweaks summarized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the uber-tweak of them all - the customizable Advanced Configuration Tool (or simply the Advanced Config) has received the Diamond treatment to allow easier tweaking without registry edits whatsoever. The possibilities are endless and they are growing by the day, so be sure to check those apps. The original Advanced Config can be found here, while the custom Diamond config app is available to download here. Both should be installed to run.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, even the best diamond specimens have imperfections, whether they are visible to the naked eye or less so. Yet, last time we checked they were still quite worth it. The situation is a bit similar with HTC's own precious stone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Diamond has revolutionary size and design, topped with unsurpassed touch functionality among Windows Mobile devices. The VGA display, the rich communications package and the excellent software bundle make the Touch Diamond a real gem. The unique magnetic stylus and the generous 4GB of built-in storage do add to the allure of this compact fella.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we already warned you the Diamond we're dealing with is not perfect. We expected better sunlight legibility of the VGA display. The edges of the impractical back panel started to wear off in two weeks or so. And finally, the lack of a memory card simply takes the allure away. We would have gladly traded the 4 gigs worth of storage for a simple hot-swappable microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5 mm audio jack would have also been welcome, as the supplied stereo headset simply doesn't cut it for music on-the-go. The camera also suffers from the back panel design, which ruins sharpness, contrast and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, in diamond terms this handset is a delicate balance of high carat and imperfections. The Touch Diamond is a crossover product that will most probably convert new believers to Windows Mobile, but would probably fail to raise itself in the demanding eyes of hard-core PocketPC devotees. Most of them will probably go for the HTC Touch Pro, for its hardware five-row QWERTY keyboard, TV-out port, beefier battery and, of course, a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up, HTC Touch Diamond is far from the uber device but it managed to win our hearts with its slick exterior and sufficient skill. There must be enough people out there to believe diamonds are forever and the HTC Touch Diamond delivers pretty much all there is to deliver.</paragraph>
