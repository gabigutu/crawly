			<paragraph>Samsung i7110 puts the latest Symbian in proper attire courtesy of the Soul. Last time we checked, metal still scored high in the fashion stakes, while 5MP camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and the latest Symbian OS promise a lot of action. The large display, the FM transmitter and optical trackpad sure round off a great spec sheet. It seems that we have quite an interesting package in our hands so let's get going - we bet there's plenty to see.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i7110 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i7110 is taking the plunge in the swarming pool of all-in-one Symbian monsters. There are virtually no gaps in the spec sheet but the mere count of similar handsets puts the i7110 up against a daunting task. Picking up where the i550 left off and staking on multimedia, the new Samsung Symbian totes up FP 2, 5 megapixel camera, better video recording and much, much better looks. Those seem to give it a good enough chance but the performance has to be there or all effort will be in vain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since this is only a preview we are making here, there's no in-depth look at the market rivals of Samsung i7110. We are only going to mention a few Symbian relations that seem to put the i7110 in the right kind of context.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar-shaped alternatives are Nokia N82 and the upcoming Nokia N79. The sliders that come to mind are Nokia N95, Nokia N95 8GB and the no-mercy-on-the-wallet Nokia N96 and Samsung INNOV8. Those who aren't looking to spend a fortune on their next handset may cheer Samsung i550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N79 ? Nokia N95 8GB ? Samsung i8510 INNOV8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One last thing to tell you, before we get to the actual review. Our Samsung i7110 is a pre-release unit, so some changes and bug-fixes are to be expected in the final retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only have a short while to spend with Samsung i7110 so let's waste no more time and get to business. Hardware, looks and handling are coming up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i7110 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i7110 has rather friendly size for its class but this still isn't all too compact. It's a tall handset but the slim girth is welcome. Just as a reference, Nokia N82 is a good 5 mm thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 125 g is about right for a phone of such build and features. It could have been lighter, had plastic been used instead of steel here and there, but we are glad Samsung didn't go for that. The metal elements on the exterior give the phone much better looking and more durable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From where we stand, Samsung i7110 looks like an extended version of the U800 Soul b. Regardless of some apparent differences, the Soul influence is beyond doubt. We did like the little U800 and even though its chubbier brother isn't as sleek, we are still fond of its looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the bar-shaped i7110 is dominated by the 2.6" 262K-color display of QVGA resolution. It has remarkable picture quality and relatively good legibility under direct sunlight. Contrast is superb, colors are vivid and brightness levels are more than adequate. As a whole, this is one of the best Samsung displays we've ever seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video-call camera and the earpiece are above the display. There is hardly anything to note here, so we move on to the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, a solid and ample D-pad is flanked by six functional keys. The central confirming part of the D-pad is in fact an 8-way optical trackpad (yes, you can swipe diagonally). That nifty feature isn't much of a big deal, but it nicely improves navigation in the web browser, which has a mouse pointer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six functional keys around the D-pad are a real disaster on our pre-release unit. Two flat pads on both side of the D-pad accommodate the main controls, which are not separate knobs but mere indications of where on the pad to press to perform a certain action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, the Menu and Clear keys are the only controls that fare decently. As for the rest, a soft key is placed above a Call or End key, implying a rocker-like action of the control pads. That's where things are real bad. All those have such a flimsy press you can hardly navigate menus or make or end calls (not without pressing the C key or Menu key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad also brings quite a lot of trouble. The Up and Down press is adequate but side-scrolling is a pain for the rigid frame and low stroke. Plus, it is almost impossible to avoid pressing the confirm button when scrolling sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get even worse when the optical trackpad is enabled at the center of the D-pad. Touching the sides almost instantly makes the trackpad react and jump the selected icon sending you to the wrong menu again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, we were about to give up reviewing the i7110 over the dreaded navigation. We do know better though than jump to conclusions from a pre-release unit. It won't be the first time when we see Samsung change designs before the market release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad takes about a third of the front panel. It surely isn't the best we have seen in terms of usability but it is OK. The large keys and the borders between the different rows are some of the positive things to note. On the other hand, the press feedback levels are quite insufficient and the flatbed keys are somewhat hard to press. We do believe, though, that the keypad is one of the things you can get used to (as opposed to the controls below the display).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left of Samsung i7110 we find the volume keys and the proprietary USB port. The two buttons are large enough but quite rigid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where the microSD slot, the camera key and the FM transmitter key are. Obviously the FM transmitter seemed important enough to Samsung engineers to deserve a dedicated key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both keys on the right side are comfortable to use and large enough to feel locate without looking at them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of Samsung i7110 is completely plain with no functional elements whatsoever. The lanyard eyelet is the only thing to find topside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens is at the back of Samsung i7110. The dual-LED flash is placed right below it. The other thing of interest here is the loudspeaker grill in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The steel battery cover just pops up once you release the latch at its bottom. Under it is a 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery, same as the one found on Samsung i8510 INNOV8. This great capacity, combined with the excellent power consumption of the S60 3rd edition FP2 phones adds up to quite good performance. The Samsung i7110 can make it through 2 full days of real hard use and this is some achievement by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7110 has remarkable build quality, at least as far as our first impressions show. The nice blend of rubbery plastic and brushed metal gives the phone a solid and exclusive feel. Handling the hefty handset is a pleasure, but the disastrous controls are a great setback. We really hope they fix those by release date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is really strong and even causing no problems with usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, Samsung i7110 hardly managed to impress us with ergonomics. Let's now check if the software part will manage to change our mind. Join us after the break as we get to know the user interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S60 User interface ver3.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian S60 3rd edition user interface is quite well known but Feature Pack 2 brings a number of novelties in both performance and visuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most important benefits of the new version of the UI is the new Active standby layout, which now allows quick access to a lot more features. The standby screen is organized in vertical tabs scrollable with the D-pad. Other than that, its functionality basically remains the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Samsung i8510 INNOV8, the i7110 auto screen rotation feature doesn't work in the menus. But that's pretty much the only place it's not active. Other than that you can rotate every screen in any application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the screen rotation in Samsung i7110 is rather attractive. Much like on the Samsung Omnia, the screen of the i7110 first zooms out nicely then rotates to landscape and zooms back in. Some eye-candy won't hurt, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole menu system of Samsung i7110 is quite fast with almost instant response. Even at these early stages our unit looks pretty stable, suggesting that lags and holdups aren't quite likely in the retail version either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery of Samsung i7110 holds little surprises. Besides the auto screen rotation, there is nothing really extraordinary about it. It is far behind Nokia N-series standards in terms of looks but its functionality is good enough. We have to admit that we did experience some lags when opening photos but we do hope that this has something to do with the pre-release status of our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no traces of the cool picture gallery we saw on the i8510 INNOV8 flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i7110 has the regular Symbian music player, there are no news in that department either. You can sort tracks by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available. Album art also gets displayed and a nice mirror effect is added too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with numerous equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an FM radio with RDS support. The i7110 can record radio broadcasts too. However, no equalizers are available for the FM radio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM transmitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time for one of the most interesting features of Samsung i7110 - the built-in FM transmitter. It allows you to broadcast your favorite tracks over a radio frequency of your choice. Those can then be picked up by any device with an FM radio receiver in the vicinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The signal strength of the i7110 is relatively good but trouble-free streaming is usually guaranteed over short distances only (car usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM transmitter application has a really nice and simple user interface and might do the job of a CD changer in your car. However it fails to transmit the artist and track info over RDS like the Sony Ericsson W980, which also had that feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is among the highlight features of the Samsung i7110. It's said to support quite a wide range of video formats, even including DivX and XviD. We managed to confirm that the i7110 plays superbly VGA videos@30fps in all the supported formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in both portrait and landscape mode with the first one quite naturally being the default one. You can also fast-forward and rewind videos as you please.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser at cruising speed with optical trackpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet on a Samsung i7110 is on par with the Samsung i8510 INNOV8 experience (read: awesome). Thanks to the great page rendering, content fits perfectly on screen and text is no problem to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is full flash support integrated in the browser. This means that you can watch videos from the desktop versions of YouTube (and the likes) straight on your mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i7110 optical trackpad in combination with the web browser virtual mouse cursor (not visible on the screenshots) really takes browsing a great step up. The trackpad lets you control the mouse pointer as freely as you like - just as on a desktop computer. And pushing the pointer to any of the borders of the visible window makes the webpage pan in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the web browser doesn't have a true fullscreen view mode, but offers an interesting overlaying toolbar (not visible on the screenshots) with several shortcuts that can be operated with the mouse pointer, much like the Samsung i8510 INNOV8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is promising<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7110 has a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS Data application gives you raw satellite data (coordinates, time, latitude, etc). It also allows you to setup basic navigation routes - either to an already stored Landmark or to a set of GPS coordinates. It doesn't offer a map or voice guidance but, as we said, it's pretty basic. It also integrates a Trip Meter, which has some pretty self explanatory functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well familiar Landmarks application allows you to setup various points of interest (obviously called Landmarks) by either storing your current GPS coordinates with a name, description and category or by picking a random spot on the map (provided by the Route66 Samsung Navigator app). You can also preview a previously stored Landmark on the Route66 map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the Route66 Samsung Navigator, which is actually a co-branded version of the popular Route66 Mobile8 application. It offers voice guided navigation and a huge number of extras but the goodies come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that Samsung are promising free pedestrian navigation to ten of the major Western Europe cities. That sounds nice, but we guess you'd have to pay for maps of any further territories. So Nokia Maps scores an advantage here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 5 megapixel camera is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While not on par with the Samsung i8510 INNOV8, the i7110 has quite a capable camera on board. The i550 is easily outperformed by 2 extra megapixels and the comfortable camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has digital image stabilization, and the proprietary Samsung Wide Dynamic range, which is used to lighten up shadows in high-contrast scenes. The extra features include geotagging, automatic panorama shooting, face detection, and even blink detection to help you avoid blink shots (which tend to be quite a lot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, our pre-release unit had some kind of problem which caused it to shoot at 4MP instead of the full 5MP resolution. Photos still ended up pretty good and on most occasions even better than the ones on Samsung i900 Omnia and Nokia N96 when compared side by side. This is a good indication for some serious shooting power in the retail version of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an impromptu shootout to show you what the camera is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if all that is not enough for you, the Samsung i7110 offers excellent video recording capabilities, too. It can capture MPEG4 video at 30fps in VGA resolution plus there's two slow-mo video capture modes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We did recommend Samsung i550 for great bang-for-buck. Now we see two of its most obvious problems addressed in the i7110 - the lack of a dedicated camera key and the simple modest looks. There is however a new problem - the poor soft key ergonomics might turn out quite a deal-breaker if things don't improve in the retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving that aside though, the handset performs admirably in almost every aspect of its lengthy spec sheet. It cannot match the INNOV8 power but it was never meant to. Samsung i7110 will be luring potential buyers with the sweet blend between Soul elegance and smartphone-grade multimedia skill. As far as our first impressions go - it is quite up to the task.</paragraph>
