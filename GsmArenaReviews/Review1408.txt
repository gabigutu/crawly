			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a large high-res screen, a Snapdragon CPU and ample amount of RAM the XPERIA X10 is nothing short of the top-end Android smartphones currently on the market. However its outdated Android version was holding it back and it found it hard to compete in the top tier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 1.6 Donut wasn?t terribly bad for its time but it?s no match for either the functionality or the performance of Eclair and Froyo. That?s why we felt that the recent Eclair update it received was significant enough to justify a new article, rather than just update the old review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course we aren?t going to repeat everything and we are going to focus on the new stuff only. If you feel like reading about the hardware we suggest you check out our original review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s start with the XPERIA X10 update changelog so you know what to expect here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now these are only the big ones ? the ones you notice straight after powering the phone on. There are also a few dozens of minor tweaks including new system fonts, a thicker notification bar, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a couple of notable absentees from the list. Multi-touch and 16M color support are still a no-go on the XPERIA X10, even after the Eclair update, which got Sony Ericsson quite a lot of critics already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now those two aren?t deal-breakers in isolation, but they certainly matter and give the X10 somewhat of an uneven start. They have basically reduced the XPERIA X10 error margin to a minimum so let?s hope all the rest of it works as promised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The testing starts right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Seven months later Sony Ericsson finally arrived at the 2.1 Eclair stop. Unfortunately, Android is all about Froyo these days and their X10 flagship is still not providing users with the latest available Google platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet the upgrade from 2.1 to 2.2 is mostly a performance upgrade, while Eclair also brought a lot of new features so we won?t be deducting so many points this time. Plus Sony Ericsson offers its own Timescape and Mediascape UI as a compensation so it?s not too bad really ? it?s just prioritizing different things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes brought by the X10 update from Donut to Eclair start with the lockscreen. The arc slider we appreciated so much is now gone to be replaced with an iPhone-style horizontal slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot of the users were complaining about that lockscreen, saying that they were unable to complete the pattern required for unlocking the devices easily, which explains why Sony Ericsson got rid of it. We however are rather sorry about that as we found the arc pattern the most natural and comfortable unlocking move. Still it?s nothing that a lockscreen customization app won?t fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we come to the homescreen that now has been extended to five panes, rather than three. There?s also support for live wallpapers, which we really find very attractive ? no matter how power-hungry and unpractical they may be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the notification area remained untouched and our hopes for Sony Ericsson to add some radio controls there remained unanswered. Well at least there?s still the power widget but you will have to go to the homescreen each time you want to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most notable improvement of the general user interface of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is its performance. Indeed as the benchmarks below show the X10 is much snappier now (though you probably won?t feel it as three times snappier), making better use of the Snapdragon CPU that?s inside it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Backup and restore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson added a cool new app, called Backup and restore, to the XPERIA X10 with the update. It doesn?t take a genius to figure out what it does but it takes a personal try to see how quickly it works. Indeed it?s certainly the quickest way to backup your applications, contacts, messages, settings, bookmarks etc. on the X10 and is probably among the more functional too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only does it allow you to select what kind of content should go into the backup (you can create as many files as you want, each with different stuff inside), but it also allows scheduling automatic backups that will start at a pre-set time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way you can make your phone backup your information each night when you aren?t using the phone so it doesn?t take you some of the quality time you spend with the handset during the day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It wouldn?t be too long of a shot to suggest that it was Timescape and Mediascape that were responsible for the delayed X10 update. Sony Ericsson has made it clear on numerous occasions that those apps are rather important for the smartphone experience so they had to make their Eclair port that works flawlessly before they release the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They finally did and social network fans will certainly appreciate the effort. There isn?t much new functionality added but the current one is probably more than sufficient anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape giving you an aggregated view of all your social network updates along with your recent correspondence (SMS, MMS, email and call log) you can stay in touch as easy as it has ever been.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get eight tabs, which you can alternate by horizontal sweeps, by scrolling the icons on the bottom or by simply pressing any of those icons. In addition to you Facebook and Twitter updates and recent messages and calls Timescape also shows your freshly captured photos and tracks you have listened to as of late. It?s almost like an automatic diary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And you can update your status straight from here, or go to the email/message client with a single click to reply to something you have received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time the option to make Timescape your homescreen is nowhere in sight so you have to rely on the widget to enter the app. We actually prefer it this way as we also like keeping other widgets around so it?s not too great of a loss.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mediascape brings all your media together<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mediascape is to your multimedia files, what Timescape is to your social activities. You get three different categories ? Music, Video and Photo, each showing your recently added, recently viewed/played files and your favorites in small rows of thumbnail images at the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the three tabs feature a More button, which will lead you to the full-featured galleries. Choosing more in the Music tab will lead you to the typical music player sorting ? recently added, recently played, favorites, albums, tracks, genres, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool feature of the photos tab allows you to link your X10 to a Facebook or Picasa account you will be able to access your web images straight from you handset. Most other Eclair devices do that for Picasa only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video player have pretty much identical interfaces with neat styling and straightforward controls. Equalizers though are still a no-go on the X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timescape gallery is originally meant to work in portrait mode only. The gallery contents can be filtered by Recently Viewed, Favorites, Albums and Friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images in each category are then displayed on a separate screen. Even if you choose to view all the pictures stored on the handset unfiltered, you will still be looking at a single vertically scrollable screen of thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only when you select a single image, the accelerometer comes into play allowing you to auto-rotate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video tab has no online access here but you get all your videos in a plain and easy to use thumbnail view. Like most of its Android siblings, the XPERIA X10 lacks support for DivX and XviD videos and those files (if there are any stored in your memory card) don't even get listed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new update gets rid of the lag when browsing images. Zooming is also rather fast so the performance is great generally. However, there's no multi-touch, so you will count on double tapping or the dedicated on-screen controls for zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Items in the galleries (albums and tracks in the music library, images in the gallery) all have an added Infinite button, which has been often praised in Sony Ericsson marketing materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touching the button, will list all the related content ? both local and online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, you can view all the other tracks in the same music album, all the images taken on the same day, related content in the PlayNow media store or even related videos on YouTube. You can even start a relevant Google search.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 sports an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash capable of taking photos at a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. We never expected the Eclair update to have some too great effect on the still shots and we were right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera was pretty decent to start with and we didn?t see any reason for messing around with it in the first place. The Cybershot-inspired interface is reasonably comfortable offering five icons on the left - capturing mode, resolution, scenes, focus mode and camcorder switch. On the opposite you can set the exposure compensation and go to the camera album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface puts the most frequently used options on the viewfinder so they?re a touch away (they can be hidden of course), but to get to the rest you need the extended settings menu. It includes options like geotagging, image stabilization, self-timer, even ?smile level? to tweak the sensitivity of the smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the only thing that was wrong with the UI before the update is still present here - the LED flash needs to be turned on manually each time you need it and that setting is buried into the extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things we are not particularly fond of is the noticeable lag when rotating the camera interface. The moment you tilt the phone the camera UI flips to another orientation, and unfortunately, it takes at least two seconds each time. So much for catching the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality has remained pretty good with good detail and colors. The noise-suppression is probably a little too aggressive for our liking and the contrast could be increased but none of those are too bad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording goes HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now here?s the big upgrade ? the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 got cool HD video recording @24fps with continuous autofocus after the update. This has more than twice the resolution of the FWVGA videos that were available before that so it?s certainly worth some attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is also only the second (after the Sony Ericsson Vivaz) HD-capable cameraphone to pack continuous autofocus in video mode. It?s efficiency is a whole other question of course as picking the correct object to focus on at all times is a task hard enough even for dedicated camcorders, let alone mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still we like it better this way than no autofocus and kudos to Sony Ericsson for incorporating it. Here's a video to show you how fast it adjusts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may take the X10 a few seconds to refocus after you reframe, but unless it?s very rapid action you are trying to capture (and cameraphones aren?t particularly good at that anyway) this won?t bother you too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The promised framerate is 24 fps and the handset delivers it nicely. There is an interesting trick Sony Ericsson use to achieve this ? when there?s more action in your viewfinder putting a strain on the processing capabilities, the camera simply lowers the quality, instead of reducing the framerate. The result is a smoother video that has less detail, instead of a more detailed but jerkier one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MP4 format with AAC audio. Check out a couple of HD samples that we captured with our test unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more - a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>An here's an untouched sample, straight from the handset for you to download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 was also included in our Video Compare Tool database. Check it out ? the tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So where does the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 stand after the update? It didn?t quite manage to take over at the top of the smartphone food chain, but to be honest we never actually expected it to. One year is a really long time in this business and understandably competitors haven?t been standing still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However not coming straight from the R&amp;D labs brings a huge pricing advantage to the X10. Indeed it can be found for nearly half the Desire HD price, which makes it a pretty decent bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Eclair virtually all the functionality is already there and compatibility with Android Market apps has been expanded greatly. The performance also takes a great leap forward and while it?s still not at Froyo levels, it?s good enough not to be bothering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as a result you get a device that won?t give you bragging rights but will give you all that it promises and throw in a few nice surprises on top (particularly for video enthusiasts and social network lovers). Sounds like a package that?s good enough for us.</paragraph>
