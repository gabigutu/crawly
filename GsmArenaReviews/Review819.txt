			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since the 2011 unveiling of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 we've been waiting for the next generation of Super AMOLED tablets. Three years later they have arrived - the Samsung Galaxy Tab S duo comes in 10.5" and 8.4" sizes and like the Tab 7.7 before them, they are stunningly thin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Separate from the Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note lines, the Galaxy Tab S tablets still share a lot with them. The powerful hardware platform, combined with proprietary TouchWiz features like Multi Window, instantly put the two at the forefront of functionality. Just look at that specs sheet.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The key difference between the Galaxy Tab S and other Galaxy tablets is clearly the screen. Samsung's return to Super AMOLED for its tablets means the slates offer stunning contrast, rich colors and on a more practical note great sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leather-like finish of the plastic back has been updated to the perforated look ala Galaxy S5, while the home buttons now host fingerprint sensors dubbed S fingerprint. At just 6.6mm thick these two pose a serious challenge to the Sony Xperia Z2 (6.4mm). Unfortunately, these two didn't inherit the Galaxy S5 water resistance along with its looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung leads the way among Android manufacturers with Multi Window - allowing split screen view with several open apps. Multitasking is growing in importance - Microsoft touts it as a key Surface feature and even Apple might be taking the split-screen plunge soon. Samsung's customizations to Android, of course, extend much further than that, but Multi Windows will seem to be a key selling feature for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After three years of waiting there's a lot of anticipation for these tablets so without further ado, flip over to the next page for our first glimpse at these gorgeous Super AMOLED screens.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is the larger of the two newly announced slates and it comes with the largest SuperAMOLED panel we've seen on a mobile device. The extra punchiness of the technology is looking as impressive as we've ever seen it on a screen this big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is still providing several screen color modes to match the particular needs of different user groups. No matter which mode you choose, it's really hard to describe how impressive the 10.5" WQHD panel actually is before you see it in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast is as great as we've come to expect from the AMOLED technology, viewing angles are so wide that everything appears as if it's printed on the front glass. There was no sun at the event venue, but the low reflectivity of the panel also bodes well for its legibility when taken outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being the first tablet in the Samsung lineup to sport a perforated faux-leather back, the design of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.5 is instantly recognizable and to a large extent familiar. This is of course due to its strong resemblance to the Galaxy S5 flagship smartphone that already passed the 10 million sales mark. We do find the material very suitable here as it greatly improves grip and it actually looks even better on the larger slate than it did on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra slim waistline adds even more to the looks as it really benefits the high-end vibe that is so crucial for tablets looking to position themselves as premium. As you might know AMOLED panels are generally slimmer than their LCD rivals, meaning that Samsung could afford to reach a 6.6mm profile, while still fitting a 7,900mAh battery inside the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. The only mainstream tablet to go slimmer than that is the Xperia Z2 Tablet (6.4mm), but that one has a notably smaller 6,000 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the performance is concerned, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 hardly brings any news. It's just as great performer as the recently announced Galaxy Tab Pro and Galaxy Note slates, and its interface is largely unchanged compared to its siblings, too. There's a twist here, though - the fingerprint sensor embedded in the home button enables some cool functionality such as protecting images in the gallery from unauthorized eyes and making quick and secure PayPal payments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also released a bunch of cool accessories for its new Galaxy Tab S 10.5 slate. The two that got our attention are the magnetic attachable covers, which use the built-in magnets to grip the slate tightly and protect it from damage, and the keyboard dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock itself is pretty slim and features a finish similar to the slate itself. Its keyboard is reasonably comfortable to type on and featuring a shortcut for the multi-window mode can turn the tablet in a proper productivity monster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll now have a look at the other member of the new hot duo - the Galaxy Tab 8.4. We'll be right back with the 10.5" slate on page 4 however, where you would find its hand-on video, complete with a short UI walkthrough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, as the name suggests, is the smaller of the two newly announced slates. It is super thin and light - an achievement made possible perhaps thanks to the Super AMOLED screen. Speaking of which, this one has WQXGA resolution (that's the same as on the Galaxy Tab Pro lineup - 2560x1600px). It borrows the Galaxy S5 flagship design to the tiniest of details - the faux-leather plastic back, the control deck at the front, the fingerprint scanner on the Home key, the earpiece grille - the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 definitely looks like a supersized Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung will be offering the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 in two colors - dazzling white and titanium bronze. The latter has a dark gray front glass, with bronze framing and bronze dotted back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 has the usual stuff at the front - there is the control deck with capacitive Back and Task Switcher keys flanking the hardware Home button. Just like on the Galaxy S5, the Home key of the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 doubles as a fingerprint scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the back of the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is pretty much the same as what we saw on the Galaxy S5. The camera is 8MP with a single LED flash and there is no heart-rate monitor. You'll notice two strange circles - these are the dedicated magnets for the flip covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 features stereo speakers - they are at the top and bottom of the slate. Samsung placed those such as no matter whether you are using your Tab S 8.4 in portrait or landscape mode, you won't muffle them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is pretty crowded - here you'll find the power/lock key, the volume rocker, the IR blaster and the microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you opt for the LTE-enabled Galaxy Tab S 8.4, you'll get an additional earpiece above the display. The slate supports voice telephony and while we guess it may look somewhat awkward and inconvenient to put the Tab S 8.4 to your ear, you can go for it if that's your thing. Just for the record, the original Galaxy Tab 7.7, Samsung's first tablet with Super AMOLED display, had the same earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a peek at the back of the LTE-enabled white Galaxy Tab S 8.4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM slot is right next to the microSD on the right side of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like for most of its Galaxy smartphones and phablets, Samsung will be offering flip covers for the Galaxy Tab S series. The original cover for the Tab S 8.4, once attached, leaves almost the entire back exposed but would protect the entire front. It doubles as a stand too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will be able to buy the flip covers in other colors as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is surely a very thin and light device. It is 6mm shorter, 2mm narrower, almost a millimeter thinner and 40g lighter than its Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 sibling. Yet it manages to pack even better hardware and slightly bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an overview of the newly announced slates. They are definitely a thing of beauty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 runs Android 4.4 KitKat skinned with the latest TouchWiz UI and Magazine UX. You've probably noticed the interface on all of our photos. It is pretty much identical to the software package on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, but we have to admit everything looks livelier on the punchy AMOLED effect.</paragraph>
