			<paragraph>Every time Nokia Nseries numbering goes up a notch geeks are holding their breath. Well, geeks - including us - are no ordinary human beings, but in the case of Nokia N96 they'd been holding their breath since February. The time this multimedia monster picked to actually hit the shelves must have made quite a few people fear it being already outdated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a successor of the Nokia N95 8GB, Nokia N96 has some king-size spec sheet to top and it can't be accused of not trying. There's FP2, double the built-in storage and DVB-H. The bloodline is strong but the crown is heavy and ancestral sins will be held against the heir twofold. The modest battery capacity and the downgraded CPU do raise some questions that need their answers. Join us for an out-and-out review of Nokia's latest top-of-the-shelf offer. Let's see if it has got the performance to walk in them shoes size N95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 comes to top the Nokia multimedia portfolio, packing almost every single feature you can think of. It extends the functionality of its predecessor - Nokia N95 8GB with 16GB of internal memory, DVB-H TV receiver, and the latest version of the Symbian OS. There are also some more minor upgrades including music keys on the front panel, a kickstand (we love that one) for more comfortable video watching and dual-LED flash. On the negative side, the CPU has been tripped up but we are yet to see how this affects the performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most obvious alternative to Nokia N96 is Samsung i8510 INNOV8. It trades the DVB-H receiver for an 8 megapixel camera with lens cover, DivX support, DNSe audio technology, and a juicier battery. It also sports an optical joystick, which rocks for browsing. The Innov8 however is slightly more expensive than N96 and it lacks the complimentary stuff (Nokia Maps, 3 months of voice navigation, a free N-gage game and the Transformers movie).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8510 INNOV8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For people on a tighter budget the Nokia N95 8GB might seem an option. It comes with all the features of N96, save for the DVB-H tuner and the FP2 but packs in a larger battery and faster CPU. The dual-LED flash isn't exactly the major upgrade to go on about. In addition, the looks of Nokia N95 8GB are way more our type. You know, we do believe something has went terribly wrong with the N81 design - and even worse, it's now reproducing itself ready to take on the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N95 8GB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you aren't a die-hard Symbian fan you might be lured away to Windows Mobile. Samsung i900 Omnia and HTC Touch Diamond are true all-in-one devices and the HTC Touch HD is just around the corner. Those who swear by QWERTY might also have a look at the HTC Touch Pro and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1. We doubt it there will be many to convert to WinMo but all those all-rounders are still worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The Windows Mobile lot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if DVB-H is your main reason to go for Nokia N96, there are a few phones that support it without costing an arm and a leg. LG HB620T and KB770 are now really close to being released and neither is likely to be priced anywhere near the N96. In addition, the KB770 features a larger 3-inch screen, which - even if not exactly widescreen telly - still counts. Nokia N77 has also been around for quite a while, but hardly got really noticed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG HB620T ? LG KB770 ? Nokia N77</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As much as we enjoy this roll-call of all-but-the-kitchen-sink gadgets, there's quite a lot to do, so let's get going. Take the jump for unboxing and checkup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ships with a car charger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 comes in a huge box that can even compare to the one of the recently reviewed Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. Contents are also quite on par with the high price tag of the new Nseries flagship and there's even a pleasant surprise in stock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N96 is in fact the first Nokia handset that ships with a car charger and it's a neat accessory we appreciate. The prebundled handsfree is a two-piece combo, which means you can easily swap the provided headset without sacrificing the remote control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two connectivity cables provided too - a microUSB one for data transfers and the CA-75U TV-out wire. The last items in this big retail package are the DC charger, a bunch of manuals and a CD with PC sync software. Somewhere among those is the activation code for the Tetris game on the N-gage platform - honestly, we didn't even bother looking for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N96 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 stands at 103 x 55 x 18 mm, totaling a volume of 92 cc. This is slightly longer and a tad slimmer than Nokia N95 8GB. Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has similar size but is the heaviest of the three. It takes quite a big pocket to stash Nokia N96 and the weight of 125g won't let you forget it's there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, size never seemed a turn-off with Nokia N95 8GB and we don't think it will be the deal-breaker for N96. Sadly, there are better reasons to be put off by this handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we begin, we should make one thing clear. Right from the very start we knew that designwise Nokia N96 is just a bigger version of the N81. We also know there are many of you out there who really like this design concept. We will just say this - our spite against this latest N-series styling is probably the only thing that our editorial team is unanimous about. We've seen better from Nokia and we'd be the first to cheer their decision to ditch it in the backyard. But until then, we'll have to continue the hardware part of this review, with gritting teeth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N96 packs a large 2.8-inch display, which takes up almost the whole front panel. Above it are the earpiece and video-call camera, there's no ambient light sensor this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tightly-squeezed controls on the front panel are an ergonomic challenge and the fact that it's all a flimsy flat membrane doesn't make it any easier. On top of that, the plastic used looks appallingly cheap. We can't help but note that by no means does the front of Nokia N96 suggest a $700 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the layout of controls is concerned, Nokia N96 kind of reminds of its predecessor - the N95 8GB. The front panel keeps the well known arrangement of a huge screen cramming a narrow navigation deck all the way down. But this time there are as many as 11 keys crowding the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of keys on this kind of space should speak for itself - those are all rather small and not really easy to use. Music fans will probably appreciate the dedicated keys but we kind of miss the point of the dual slide design. If the two gaming keys are its sole purpose then the N81 solution seems much more convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call and End keys are part of the flat membrane but are well defined and amply sized, which is better than the N81 and N78. We have to admit the flat controls provide sufficient press feedback (the dedicated music keys less so, but still passable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian and C key placement is not the most convenient though. Placed at the very bottom of the navigation deck those are perfectly usable with the slider up, but reaching to them in closed position runs the risk of toppling the heavy handset off your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is the size of that in N95 8GB but this time you have a huge confirm button and quite a thin navigating frame. The design was obviously dictated by the Navi wheel functionality. However that functionality was dropped just before the N96 hit the shelves leaving only the inconvenient D-pad behid. The N95 8GB D-pad styling is way more user friendly for normal navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Nokia N96 hosts the microSD card slot and the lanyard eyelet. The phone handles an 8GB memory card problem-free. Furthermore, various sources confirm that it works with the newly released 16GB microSD cards (not that we expected any different). That adds up to potential memory capacity of up to 32GB, which sounds well impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Nokia N96 features the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. Those controls are a blatant attempt to defy user-friendliness. While the rigidity of the volume key is almost forgivable, the camera key is beyond belief. It's so uncomfortable that it renders taking any kind of decent photos with the N96 almost impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera knob scrapes against the sides of its cleft and the distinct clack is our least concern. With this shutter key there's almost no distinct half press. It is quite a challenge to lock focus and then take a photo without shaking or even dropping the phone. We can't even imagine what went wrong with this particular button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two elements on the right side are the two speakerphone grills, placed symmetrically at the very top and bottom corners of the casing. That seems very proper given the kickstand that props the phone up for desktop use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of Nokia N96 we see the keypad lock slider, the 3.5mm standard audio jack and the power key. The only concern here is the On/Off knob: it is too small and flush with the surrounding surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of Nokia N96 features the microUSB port, mouthpiece and the charger plug. No cap over the USB slot means it can fill up with dirt - we've been there already with both N95 and N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens at the back is complemented by dual-LED flash and the kickstand we already mentioned. The latter has nothing to do with photography but allows the phone to be placed on a desk at the best angle for TV/video watching. It is quite a nice solution indeed though the fragile piece of plastic should probably be handled with care.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear, much like the front, is all plastic but definitely looks better. Subdued gloss and neat wave-like patterns do give the handset some of the conservative style its price tag deserves. It is still quite easy for the surface to get greased and messy. There's no protection for the camera lens, either. It is not even sunk a millimeter as on Nokia N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover is done by pressing the latch at the top and gently lifting - this time Nokia have done well. Under the hood lies the 950 mAh Li-Ion BL-5F battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life was one of the most troublesome aspects of the original Nokia N95 and, after the 1200 mAh BL-6F upgrade in the 8GB version, we almost cannot believe Nokia went back to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The current 950 mAh battery can hardly provide a day of extensive usage, even with the downgraded CPU. In fact, our guess is that the main reason for planting the slower CPU is its reduced power consumption. All you get as a result is at least the extra time to go home and plug the charger. We are yet to see how that CPU affects UI response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By this point you should probably guess our opinion of the Nokia N96 build quality. It is all the way inconsistent with the price of the device. One thing should be given though - it seems more durable and not so easy to wear as the Nokia N95 8GB's rubberized back for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, our experience with Nokia N81 shows this type of plastic is really easy to get scratched. We still can't make up our mind about which is worse to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 is quite a hefty piece of gear but size is the least imposing obstacle to handling. There are a lot of design modifications from N95 8GB and we can't say they are a boost to user-friendliness. The flatbed controls are perfectly usable but hardly stand comparison to N95 8GB for both looks and tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nicely shaped tactile D-pad of N95 8GB is more user-friendly and could be quite valuable to some. The added music keys may be an enhancement but they question the dual slide design and complicate the navigation pad. Finally, while either approach may have its backers and opponents, the despicable shutter key on N96 is a blatant insult.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display - a winner<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2.8" treat of a screen is probably the best way for Nokia N96 to salvage some pride. Excellent picture is a perfect complement to its generous size. In all fairness, brightness has been slightly reduced compared to Nokia N95 8GB but still keeps a very high level. The contrast is also commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility has always been the Nokia element. Nokia N96 makes no exception remaining perfectly legible even on the brightest of days. Colors do get a bit washed away in the strong sun but this doesn't greatly affect usability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remember that "frightfully ugly fellow, but he does have his uses!" line? Well, we cannot possibly think of any better way of describing the alphanumeric keypad of Nokia N96 (could've said the same about the navigation pad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cheap plastic looks (6220 classic, anyone?) aside, the keypad of Nokia N96 is OK to type on. Size is adequate even though the rows are a little narrow. There are no distinct borders between keys and the key stroke isn't the best we've seen but that's nothing you can't live with. With some time getting used, you may as well get to enjoy typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys reveled on top of the phone are quite nice to use with their size making them very comfortable even for people with larger hands. They have two modes - "music keys" where all four are usable and "gaming", where only the middle two are actually active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of Nokia N96 is strong enough but somewhat uneven. It also has a distinct yellow tint, which we don't really like. The white backlighting of Nokia N95 8GB looked a whole lot better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Latest Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd Edition user interface. Feature Pack 2 comes preinstalled, bringing both visual and performance improvements that we first saw in Nokia N78. In all fairness, the performance updates are also available to some FP1 devices through firmware updates, but there are still some goodies exclusive to FP2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most important benefits of the new UI is the new Active standby layout, which now allows quick access to a lot more features. The standby screen is organized in vertical tabs with the D-pad used for scrolling them. Other than that, its functionality basically remains the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by screen is a nice and convenient way of bringing shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby or not, you can always change the shortcuts assigned to the two soft keys to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navi wheel functionality is also extended as compared to N81 and it reveals its full potential. Among some of the other FP2 upgrades are a new picture gallery and picture geotagging. They will get their the due attention later on in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager is a well known Symbian application, which has improved in terms of looks with the new FP. It is also now appearing on top of every pop-up menu. The shortcut used in previous versions of the OS by pressing and holding the menu key still works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some nice menu transition effects. The Symbian OS has been all too well known for offering little eye-candy but now it seems to be trying to catch up. It is still far from, say Apple iPhone standards, but those are too different devices for such a comparison to be fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU and the built-in RAM are probably the two most important factors concerning smartphone performance. The 128MB of RAM are a feat in Symbian terms and is almost impossible to deplete. The things with the CPU are however somewhat different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual ARM9 264 MHz CPU used in Nokia N96 is still faster than most other devices out there but is a downgrade from the dual ARM 11 332 MHz that we saw on both Nokia N95 versions. Truth to be told, only heavy apps (N-gage for example) can make the difference as far as we can tell. We still can't help but wonder why downgrade one of most important parts of what's supposed to be the new Nseries flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N96 user-available memory extends to a little less than 15GB (it's an old trick rounding off every 1000 bytes to a kilobyte, plus there's system-reserved capacity). It still is an impressive space to fill up but even if you do there's a microSD card slot to help you. Accessing content on the card or the phone memory is done at about the same speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia menu is among the Nseries highlights and the Nokia N96 is hardly an exception here. It is launched by pressing the dedicated key and provides quick access to the multimedia features of the handset. It is identical to the ones found on Nokia N81 and Nokia N82 with icons sorted thematically. They appear as drop-down lists when the respective tab is selected. Those can also be freely reordered if the layout isn't to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It's doing a very good job actually, being fully speaker-independent and recognizing a high percentage of the spoken commands. You don't need to prerecord the commands nor the contact names from your phonebook, which is really convenient.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N96 main menu offers four different view modes. Two of them are the well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list. In addition, you can choose whether you prefer your icons animated or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe layouts. They have a charm of they own but, if we were to be asked, they aren't as user-friendly and do take their time getting used to. The font sizes throughout the menus are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can change the currently active theme. There are only three preinstalled themes on Nokia N96, but you are by no means limited to them only. Downloading additional ones from the internet and installing them on your N96 is quick and easy and the choices offered are endless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has no issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the in-call performance of Nokia N96 is concerned, the chubby fellow is doing pretty well. It doesn't have any problems with neither low signal, nor interferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no preinstalled smart-dialing feature on the Nokia N96, unlike e71 or some competing brands. However the aforementioned voice recognition system is just as convenient - you only have to hold the right soft key in standby and speak after the tone. If you have more than one number assigned to the name you should set one as default or otherwise the first entered number will be dialed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results from our loudspeaker test. Nokia N96 did manage to impress us here producing an excellent score. It seems that there is a quite powerful voice hidden in the large body. Here is the table comparing the N96 to some of the other handsets we've put to the same test. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian style phonebook of Nokia N96 has practically unlimited capabilities. The storage space can possibly stretch out to fill the whole phone memory, which is impossible to deplete even if you tried intentionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 also sports the Call log application to keep track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included). The period can be shortened to save some space but you are quite unlikely to do that, as even with a huge number of calls the log only takes a few miserly kilobytes of memory space. And Nokia N96 is surely not the phone to have you fussed over storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 is surely going to be appreciated by the people who text a lot. The keypad does reasonably well and the software support is completely up to the Symbian high standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not really surprising, Nokia N96 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The first two share the all too familiar intuitive editor. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching from SMS to MMS is as simple as inserting some multimedia content. A nice feature allows automatic resizing of pictures that are too large for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 also features the dedicated audio message editor. You can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports pop up on the standby screen and are subsequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to match almost any emailing needs of the user. The best part is that Nokia N96 sports the ultra easy email setup we came to know in recent Nokia phones. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email-on-the-go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mailbox (be it POP or IMAP) is set to run on the N96.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. There is also support for attachments, signatures and you can hardly think of something important that the Nokia N96 is missing.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player flying high<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is another noteworthy Nokia N96 application. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't play. Album art is also supported but unluckily there are no alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available. You can also create your own playlists in no time. The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You can avoid that if you upload the music via Nokia's proprietary PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and if they seem insufficient you can create new ones in a matter of seconds. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated music keys do help the sonic experience but, like we said, having two sets of them is too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the A2DP Bluetooth profile means that you can enjoy your favorite tracks on a stereo wireless headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has improved, still not too impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Nokia N96 has improved over its predecessors. The phone now has commendable noise and dynamic range levels, comparable to the best examples on the market. The frequency response has also been improved although it is still not perfect. However it is much better than it was on the Nokia N95 so the steps seem to be in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problems about the audio quality of Nokia N96 are the comparatively high distortion levels and the relatively bad stereo crosstalk (this is not really disturbing). And here go the results so you can see for yourselves if Nokia N96 is good enough for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N96 frequency response graph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 features Real player for playing your video clips. The video player can be displayed in both portrait and landscape mode and can be switched to fullscreen. When in full screen, the soft key labels are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing experience and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, watching a video clip on a screen with this kind of picture quality is really enjoyable. The generous size is also a welcome benefit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the kickstand comes in really useful. You can easily prop your Nokia N96 on a desk and watch without having to hold it. The stereo speakers come on top, which also improves the video watching experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again the dedicated keys are rather convenient for managing your video files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>DVB-H<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 also comes complete with a DVB-H tuner, which enables it to receive digital TV broadcasts. Through the Live TV application you can access mobile television and radio services and watch and listen to digital programmes. The interface of the application is quite simple and easy to work with but have in mind that this feature isn't available without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently DVB-H is only available is a handful of cities around the world, which makes the Nokia N96 even more of a niche product. Here is  the list of lucky places, where you can enjoy digital TV on handheld devices. As far as the rest of the world is concerned - the key selling feature of Nokia N96 doesn't look that tempting now, does it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N96 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and Visual radio. The latter requires internet connection and WLAN won't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With RDS and automatic scanning however you're less likely to resort to network data transfers with Visual Radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition Nokia N96 offers a direct shortcut to the online radio directory where hundreds of stations are available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery got even better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia N96 is simply great with the 3D rotating view. The Navi wheel is in its prime here, making image browsing quite fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Feature Pack 2 also brings some really cool improvements to the gallery application. The browsing system is now letting you speed up photo browsing if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of cleaning up your memory every now and then. Besides, the gallery has a much more conveniently placed shortcut for accessing picture details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, no changes are to be seen here in terms of features - pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and zoomed in up to 8x (not that anyone would actually need that much). The zooming is now in much smaller steps, which makes it quite a lot slower than it used to be on Nokia N95 8GB. Still the general performance is on the better side of phones we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also offers a nice slide show with customizable effects and delay between slides. You can also choose the direction of the slideshow - forward or backward from the currently selected photo and the track to go with. The music can also be switched off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a nice picture tagging system. In addition to the geotagging which is automatically handled by the camera, you can add as many tags as you like to each photo and then use them as filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management functionality (which even includes sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that Nokia N96 can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an application manager to take care of the installed applications on Nokia N96. Not much to talk about here, as it is identical to the one in any other Symbian device. Its functionality boils down to providing details about installed applications, removing them and keeping a log of movements in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new version of the useful "Search" application is also aboard Nokia N96. It has a reserved line in the active standby menu, which is hardly a surprise given how useful it is. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Read my lens<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. It sports autofocus and a dual-LED flash but unluckily no lens protection whatsoever. This means the glass protecting the lens is quite vulnerable to scratches and finger smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just a quick glance at the text on Nokia N96 lens is enough to tell us that its sensor has been downgraded. It shows a focal length of 5.2, while Nokia N95 8GB has a focal length of 5.6. Having in mind that both handsets have the same angle of view this clearly indicates that a smaller sensor has been used in Nokia N96. The photos also come to confirm this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus is surely the best thing about the Nokia N96 camera. The software bit of it, that is. The atrocious shutter key is doing its best to ruin things big time. Anyway, autofocus is almost instant in broad daylight and quite quick in low light too. The dedicated AF assist light also helps here. N96 sure is the first cameraphone we see to achieve focus lock as quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice camera feature is geotagging, which by the way, works with videos too. GPS locks are quite fast, so you won't have to wait too much for your first geotagged shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it's not all bed of roses for the camera in N96. The camera key deserves every ounce of our indignation and we just won't leave it be. The button is almost impossible to use and makes taking a decently focused photo a real challenge even with the great AF system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI of Nokia N96 is the same as in N95 8GB. Using our favorite tab layout, it offers extensive settings - starting from manual white balance and ISO sensitivity and including exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast settings. Various effects are also at hand, labeled color tones. However, we are disappointed to find the option of customizing icons on the toolbar we saw on the low-key Nokia 6220 classic missing in N96.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Nokia N96 is decent but, much to our surprise, not as good as any of the Nokia N95 versions. It is quite obvious that a smaller sensor have been used in Nokia N96 resulting in a reduced dynamic range. The handset also has a strong tendency to overexpose photos which brings in quite prominent highlight clipping. The clipping of a single color channel, resulting in loss of detail is also quite common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the colors are rather precise and the noise is kept to a decent level. In favorable weather there is more than enough detail and even foliage seems to come out pretty well. Sharpness levels are also very good with no traces of excessive sharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the sample photos made with the camera of Nokia N96.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also an impromptu little shootout we made between Nokia N96 and Nokia N95 8GB. At this point, it seems the N96 will be struggling to motivate cameraphone admirers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the N96 camera shoots in VGA resolution at the sweet 30fps. Sounds like really good quality and it very well is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MPEG-4 format and can have automatic or manual white balance. The other available settings are night mode and color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video (5.8MB) for you to enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting people<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Nseries are all about connectivity and it is hardly a surprise that the flagship supports all popular means of data transferring. USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 are a nice start of the lengthy list. All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - from ageing GPRS, through EDGE to 3G with HSDPA - Nokia N96 has it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the wireless communication tally, Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. A nice improvement coming with the FP 2 now allows for quick locating of hidden wireless networks with the sharpish WLAN scanner right on the stand-by screen. This was also possible with the previous Nokia handsets but took a lot more time, as the WLAN wizard had to be used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the memory card slot is here and makes good value if you have a card reader at hand. The missing thing with Nokia N96 is the Infrared port but we are not going to pretend that we are even slightly missing it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet with Nokia N96 is at typical smartphone heights. Even the most complex and elaborate of web pages are rendered problem-free and fit the screen perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level and font size are also adjustable at the expense of only a few key presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large display is one of the best things about browsing the web on Nokia N96. Even the smallest font is readable on the 2.8" unit and that allows you to fit more content and save some scrolling effort. The large amount of RAM makes sure you will never get memory full warnings even if you load several quite heavy web pages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Splendid organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing skills of Nokia N96 are really top-notch. The handset comes with a huge number of time-managing applications and they all have nice functionality and user-friendly interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has the typical three different view modes - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel, PDF and PowerPoint files seamlessly. Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included version of the Quickoffice. If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application from the Nokia Download center for a rather hefty fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final file managing application is the ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>N-gaging the games section<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 comes in with quite a number of N-gage games preloaded. The new Nokia gaming platform is really great and with the dedicated gaming key you are up for an exciting time with this phone. Or so it seems at first sight, as only one of the games is actually a full version and the rest need to be purchased separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also kinda strange that the title picked to include in our package was no other than Tetris. With all due respect to this timeless classic, something with more action and impressive graphics would have suited the N96 much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you can download some free games from Nokia download center but those aren't as good as the N-gage titles. There are also plenty of third-party games out there, so Nokia N96 users can easily download both native and java titles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation: improvement all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N96 has a built-in GPS chip that can be considered a serious upgrade to the one found in either Nokia N95 version. With a far more sensitive receiver, Nokia N96 is coming close to some of the best examples in the business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took the phone a little more than a minute to get satellite lock upon cold start and that sounds rather good. There are hardly many cases where this type of speed will let you down. Furthermore, A-GPS is bound to reduce this time even further. Have in mind though that data transfer charges apply in this case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in GPS receiver works with the Nokia Maps application, which is one of the software navigation applications to offer the most detailed maps. Furthermore, it is free and relatively easy to use, as far as the most basic functionality is concerned. What's even better, with Nokia N96 it comes complete with 3 months worth of free voice-guided navigation. This basically means Nokia N96 is good to serve as an in-car navigation unit straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Maps application itself is doing pretty well in terms of features too. It has very decent looks and easily customizable route planning algorithm. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. The route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional features like traffic information and city guides can also be activated but they come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in case you are still unhappy with Nokia Maps you can go for a third-party application and there are quite a lot of those available. User reports suggest the internal GPS has no problem working with any of the more popular 3rd party navigation apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the Nokia N96 GPS functionality is very positive, comparative to our favorite among Nokia GPS phones - Nokia N78. The latter trades the larger screen for an even more sensitive GPS receiver. Any of those phones is highly unlikely to leave even the most demanding users disappointed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words: Too little, too late<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Maybe Nokia N96 wasn't really intended to take the market by storm and turn the world around. Maybe it was meant to quietly update the top multimedia gadget of the house and continue to cash in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It just seems Nokia won't put all eggs in the same basket. And that makes us wondering. More high-end stuff will be available in affordable handsets, Arte will continue to define exquisite splendor, Eseries will go on blending exceptional skill with refined elegance and Touch UI will slowly be conquering the company portfolio. If all those assumptions are true, shall we fear the Nseries packed with features beyond belief but only getting uglier?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tempted though we are to say that failure is looming over Nokia N96, we know better than that. There will be quite a lot of diehard Symbian fans (and even a few individuals that do actually need DVB-H support) that will go against their aesthetic sense and get the N96. And no, we don't think they will be disappointed or eager to agree with most of the things we said in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the rest of the potential buyers - Nokia N96 is a great software package that comes in an utterly user-unfriendly shell. The ergonomics of the device are so poor (except for video watching) that operating it is a chore, rather than fun. Not to mention looks that are?.oh well, controversial will have to do. It's just that when you dish out a healthy sum it's only fair to expect style and finesse. For all we know, style and finesse may have different meaning in the geek world and that's where the name of Nokia N96 sure rings a special bell.</paragraph>
