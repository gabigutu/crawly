			<paragraph>Inspired by the Sony T-series point-and-shoot digcams with an elegant lens cover, the Sony Ericsson C903 is a compact and attractive cameraphone. The C903 is packed with features you'd expect of a high-end phone and it behaves like one as well. A GPS-enabled 5 MP slider with a nice large display, nifty feature-phone interface and friendly size is a welcome addition to the company portfolio. And yes, we think the Glamour Red version will be a favorite with the ladies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C903 official announcement served the humble purpose of warming the crowd up for the Sony Ericsson deployment at this year's MWC. Obviously no match for the Idou and Hikaru, the C903 simply completes the Cyber-shot lineup of the house featuring some welcome upgrades over the C902 like screen size and GPS. There's a distinctive design highlight too and the Sony T-series digicam back styling may as well be a strong selling point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 has its candybar counterpart in the face of the C901. Presented in a joint launch last month, the two handsets are trying to meet a diverse mix of cameraphone demand in the higher-midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Form factor aside, the major differences boil down to GPS and the camera flash solution. We can't help but note that xenon could've been more at home in the T-series-inspired C903. But no sir, Sony Ericsson C903 is GPS-enabled instead while the more conservative C901 bar flaunts the better camera flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lengthy spec sheet of the C903 only omits Wi-Fi support, while everything else is on board: GPS with Wayfinder 7 software, 5 megapixel AF camera with dedicated setup keys, a large 2.4" display and accelerometer sensor for UI auto-rotate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now then, we're all set for a closer look at the C903, so buckle up and hit the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C903 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 measures 97 x 49 x 16 mm and weighs 96 grams. It's a compact phone and the T-series digicam styling is its most notable design highlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 is made entirely of glossy plastic which looks and feels good. The only downside of this kind of surface is its ability to attract fingerprints. While we're at it, the brushed metallic finish of the Sony Cyber-shot T-series is well above the plastic gloss we have here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is entirely made of the glossy black plastic in question spiced up with silvery accents on the D-pad and a thin line that divides the display and the control deck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have no concerns over the comfort and usability of the navigation keys and D-pad, as well as the numpad itself. The camera lens cover looks and works just fine too, the slider action only is just a bit rough at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2.4" QVGA display dominates the front panel. Above it, an ambient light sensor and a earpiece share the topmost section of the front. The front facing camera is a controversial issue: our test unit has no such thing while on alternative pictures by Sony Ericsson themselves a video-call camera is clearly seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video calls were certainly an option on our device, however it only used the main 5 megapixel camera for the purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel design features a D-pad and navigation keys that are very comfortable to use and have nice tactility. The D-pad is flanked on either side by the typical bulging knobs of the Call and End key. The thing to note here is the unusual styling of the soft keys, which do have a distinct Nokia feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flatbed buttons at the bottom are Activity Menu on the left and the Clear key on the right. The controls are generally quite comfortable to handle, our only concern is the somewhat flimsy press of the direction keys on the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is big enough though and it looks quite like the one on the C905. That actually makes us hopeful the C903 D-pad will be better in the retail units, just like the case was with the Sony Ericsson C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The confirm key is quite responsive and tactile. In camera mode the D-pad gets some extra functionality and imaging-related controls are backlit in blue. The direction keys on the D-pad are assigned to focus mode, shoot mode, flash control and self-timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone up reveals the flatbed alphanumeric keyboard, which is an almost exact replica of the C905 numpad. We definitely won't frown at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thin metallic ridges between rows enhance touch orientation and tactility is further improved by the fact that the flatbed keypad is tangibly ribbed to the touch. Key presses involve a distinct click and typing is quick and easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft white keypad backlighting is strong and remarkably even. The D-pad backlighting has a bluish tint - an almost inevitable spillover from the alternative blue illumination in camera mode.The controls on the sides of the D-pad are lit in a soft, even white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad locks automatically upon sliding the phone closed, and that's non-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson C903 features nothing but the regular Fast Port - unfortunately, but quite expectedly, it doesn't have any protective cover to conceal the connectors and keep away dirt and grime away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M2 memory card symbol simply indicates the whereabouts of the actual slot, which is hidden under the battery cover. It is hot-swappable though, you just have to remove the back cover to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill lies almost unnoticeable on the left near the memory card slot section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the slightly elevated volume rocker - which doubles as a zoom lever when taking or browsing pictures - and all the camera controls. The two-step shutter key is also there and is positioned very comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we don't like about it is press feedback. While the half press is quite distinct, the full press has no clear stop whatsoever. This may as well be a pre-release fault though and we regularly see design faults disappear on many other handsets before they hit the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Halfway up the right side there are another couple of camera keys which are connected in the same manner as the volume rocker key. They are the dedicated camera mode switch and the Gallery button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the phone is totally bare and features no controls or keys whatsoever</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side features only the lanyard eyelet and a small sliding switch with a padlock pictogram. It is used for releasing/locking the battery cover. Do not look for the mic pinhole down there since it's located on the keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most distinctive part of this phone is the back side. Just like on certain series of digicams, the camera lens and LED flash are revealed by sliding down a cover that occupies almost the whole back of the phone. This cover has a decorative silver stripe running across the middle of the phone when closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This active sliding mechanism is very smooth and it immediately starts the camera. There is a slight resistance when starting to slide down the cover, but after the mid-point it goes down all the way almost automatically. Thumbs up for both looks and handling here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh. The same unit is widely used across a range of Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer claims the battery should provide up to 400 hours of standby and up to 10 hours of talk time in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over two to five days on a single charge, depending mainly on GPS and multimedia usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 is a compact and distinctly styled slider. Ergonomics are just fine and we hope the minor handling issues are easily fixed before the phone starts shipping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: Good, above average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 employs a 2.4" 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution and it is said to have a scratch resistant surface. Though the same size and resolution as the C905 display, the two screens are quite different in terms of color and reflections. The superior mineral coated display of the C905 is extremely low on reflections and has superb clarity and contrast while the display of the C903 is more reflective resulting in less vivid colors. Regardless, it's still one of the better displays on a Sony Ericsson phone. Sunlight legibility is excellent, even under direct sunlight. We have no problems with either reading or typing using both dark and light themes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: no news is sometimes good news<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C903 interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that is used in most of their top handsets. To say it straight, the C903 offers nothing than a few cosmetic tweaks over the year-old C902 - except for the new threaded messaging of course. It's also true though that it doesn't fall short of the Cyber-shot top dog C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar featuring tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth but you can't do that when sending a file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a hardly noticeable lag involved but we guess that's to be preferred over an over-sensitive accelerometer that can often play up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has five themes preinstalled: Amber, Amethyst, Azure, Borderline, and Clarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson handsets also come with a handy option for their wallpaper - you can use an application as a background instead of an actual image. Of course you can't just use any application - the choice is currently limited to one of out of only three apps. These are WalkMate, Slideshow Wall and Rock Bobblehead. The step counting WalkMate is probably the only practical app among them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs the tabbed interface used throughout the phone. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson C903. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or Smart Search as Sony Ericsson are calling it is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were unable to perform our standard loudspeaker performance test, as the pre-release unit we had performed inconsistently. We will update this review as soon as we get our hands on a final unit. This also concerns the audio quality test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with conversations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging is probably the only place where the interface has seen changes. The new thingy is the alternative conversation-style layout, which displays message threads - the SMS communication with a certain contact is organized as blobs in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the conversation-style layout and the regular Inbox is only a matter of toggling a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact is that if you get a reply while you're still in the thread, it will be automatically added to the conversation, instead of appearing as an alert on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson C903 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Categories also allows quick and comfortable sorting of messages with separate folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. When composing a message, a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit, to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped to get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Thumbs up for the Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 runs the flash-based Media Center. Its menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, YouTube, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Player to be found in C903 is version 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of Walkman player 3.0. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Other extras include fullscreen mode and screenshot capability, and you also have the option to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken and prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the highlighted photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section again opens as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a richly-featured tool for managing your photo collection and it offers very good customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The Up key on the D-pad offers quick access to sending options like Send as Picture Msg, as Email, to Blog or via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow feature are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the C903 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images thanks to its built-in GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but somewhat pushed aside with the timeline view missing. We actually doubt if this timeline feature will be available in future phones, as the trend is integrating Walkman and Cyber-shot features across the Sony Ericsson portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, VideoDJ and MusicDJ are signature features for all Sony Ericsson phones, and are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond, yet extreme zooming won't really do any good. Browsing full-res images didn't involve any lag at all, while zooming does take a little time. The magnified section of the image loads in low quality and only appears in full res after a couple of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson C903 has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. The service interface comes with the same expanded features that we first saw on C902 - "Find similar music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now there is one more update to the TrackID - the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5 megapixel camera can use a push<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you should already know by now, the Sony Ericsson C903 has a 5 megapixel camera capable of producing images with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped with a LED flash to assist shooting in poor light conditions. The flash itself is quite weak even for a LED unit - noticeable weaker than the Sony Ericsson W995 flash for example. Of course, take our words with a pinch of salt - the flash performance may change before the phone gets into production.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera offers a wide range of niceties such as smile shutter, face detection, image and video stabilizer, BestPic, auto-rotate, macro mode, spot metering, camera images geo-tagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has the familiar user interface. Its pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings are here to facilitate the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. Sadly, an ISO setting is not available in the C903.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image stabilizer is supposed to keep images from blurring in dark environments but, as in all phone cameras so far, it's purely a software tweak of questionable efficiency. Plus, no stabilization can help you if your subjects are moving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shoot mode menu has five modes, two of which deserve special attention - the well known BestPic and a feature introduced to the market for the first time by Sony Ericsson in C905 via a firmware update - the Smile Shutter mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Smile Shutter is easy - first you fully press the camera key all the way down to activate it. A small blinking yellow icon in the right upper corner indicates that the mode is working and from here on the phone automatically snaps the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 9 full-size 5 megapixel images in about 1.6sec, each of them of approximately 1MB of size. The slow mode takes 9 images again but at a larger interval of about 2.8sec. The good thing about the BestPic mode is that the LED flash can be used in both slow and fast modes and illuminates constantly while the camera takes the 9 photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a built-in GPS receiver, the Sony Ericsson C903 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add GPS location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated. A satellite icon in the top left corner shows that the phone is attempting to get a GPS lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the proper geo-tagging of images requires some time for the GPS to lock position. The successful lock is depicted by a set of green stripes in the upper right corner of the camera viewfinder (right next to the satellite icon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course speed up the process by enabling the Assisted-GPS function, but this would generate some extra data traffic on your account. So please bear that in mind if you want to use A-GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the C903 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm (focus lock is reported in the viewfinder even at closer distances but the image is actually a bit blurred).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The silent shooting mode completes the notable features of the C903 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one shortcoming that concerns the one-way camera menu layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar as it's the last item there. Browsing items on the toolbar from the opposite should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C903 camera is a capable shooter. The images are crisp with good contrast though with a clear tendency to over-sharpen edges, especially in high-contrast areas. Noise level seems relatively high, especially with insufficient light, but the autofocus camera does very well at close-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is relatively good, though all colors are a bit cold. We think they need about 10% more saturation to look natural. And finally, there is a lot of purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trademark red-to-pink conversion that all recent Sony Ericsson cameraphones manifest is kept under control and we see well balanced reds and pinks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, at this stage the Sony Ericsson C903 outputs an identical image quality to Sony Ericsson C902. We expected at least a little improvement but it looks like the lens, the processing logic and the image sensor used are the same as in the C902. We have seen what Sony Ericsson are capable of with the superb image quality of the C905 camera, and we hoped to see at least a bit of its glory here in the C903 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, photos at 100% should not be indicative, as even mid-range digicam quality suffers at full size. Just to give you an idea of what the C903 photos can turn out with just a wee bit of photoediting, here are the samples downsized to 1024x768 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the C903 is also capable of capturing video, even if it's limited to QVGA resolution at 30fps. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing the usual way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended home screen, also available in the recently reviewed C905, T700 and G705. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes to various bright colors each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode in portrait mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is nice to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page but the first match is not immediately listed and you need to press the find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb OperaMini as a suitable replacement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity runs full steam ahead<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C903 is not an internet-centric device despite its big 2.4" display, but it scores highly on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. HSDPA and HSUPA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson C903 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot, which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C903 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator, and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu and there are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other well known application Alarm with tabbed view doesn't need any introduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson C903 comes with Photo Mate, PullFace 2, Rock Bobblehead, Slideshow Wall and Walk Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Mate offers help and practical tips for getting the most out of your camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PullFace 2 is a funny photo application that allows you to alter your images with photorealistic results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rock Bobblehead is again an application meant just for fun and it allows you to play bobblehead with an Elvis Presley doll using the built-in accelerometer. This application is mostly intended to be used as a homescreen wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Slideshow Wall is a simple application that displays the available images with a few animations. The main purpose of this application is that it can be used as a wallpaper, otherwise it would've been quite useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application which works in background mode getting its data from the built-in accelerometer. Again, it can be used as wallpaper.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled on the C903. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all the features of Location services, internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance based on the available information in the database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view and the user interface is clean and intuitive. Traffic information is another important feature here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60-minute period. GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Log application in the Location services tracks and saves each position request, which is accessible at any time afterwards. Each entry in the log is saved in descending order by date and displays the date and time, as well as the exact GPS position.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wayfinder Navigator 7 navigation software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wayfinder Navigator 7 is n GPS navigation system for your mobile phone. As in previous Sony Ericsson models, turn-by-turn navigation is only offered on trial for a limited time and then after that you must pay a monthly subscription.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also experience the benefits of the application in advance at the MyWayfinder.com site. Essentially, it is a navigation planner on the web, where you are able to plan trips in advance, manage favorites, send routes and destinations by e-mail, and find online information. You can get the full potential of it after free registration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Route planning is extensive, there's a choice between vehicle and pedestrian modes on top of the "plan route" menu. Avoiding toll roads is also one-click away. Routes can be optimized for time, distance or traffic info. You are allowed to choose among three modes of voice prompts: complete, fewer or none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Navigation mode you can opt for automatic, Guide, 3D map and 2D map views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traffic information can also be displayed if available in your region. It has to be activated from the settings menu to work.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tracker application for the sports-minded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone also features the Tracker sports application, which allows you to keep track of your speed, distance, route, and calories during training. Using the Tracker doesn't require connection to the Internet, and there are no costs for using it. When the Tracker application is started and "Start training" is selected the application looks for available satellites. Users can choose between time, distance, route based or no limit trainings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu of the Tracker application consists of Start training, Routes, Results, Summary, and settings submenus. Under Routes the routes covered so far are stored. The distance covered is shown in either meters or kilometers. Each route can be viewed in a graphic map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results sort all the activities in a calendar month view. Sessions saved for the particular month are indicated by a small icon. The same holds true when day view is selected. Each result can be analyzed on a graph or replayed. The graph shows the average speed and the total activity time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the settings menu there are plenty of customization options for the Tracker - units, energy consumption, personal profile, auto save routes, etc. In the personal profile you are prompted to enter such details as gender, height, weight, and year of birth. Having defined a speed zone when starting a training session, you will be prompted with phone vibration and on-screen text to speed up or slow down to keep within the preset speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the Tracker application - it proved a handy piece of software. Bear in mind that it requires access to satellites and cannot be used in covered areas such as indoor gyms or the like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 has four games preinstalled: Bubble Town, Crosspix, Real Football 2 and Treasure Towers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bubble Town is a tetris-like game where you have to match similar faces to free up the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Crosspix is a puzzle-based game. You have to decorate the galleries you enter with pictures based on the puzzles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real Football 2 is as you can guess an action sports simulator with rich options and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Treasure Towers is also an action based game where you play as Dr. Tatou climbing up each tower, collecting treasures and avoiding obstacles. It is quite an amusing game - actually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C903 is a cameraphone but it also likes to come off as a genuine all-rounder. Our traditional competition comparing has moved to the conclusion, bit it's still as relevant as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C903 competition consists of several phones all of them sharing the the major specifications with the C903 - a slider form factor, quad-band GSM and HSDPA support, GPS and A-GPS support, 5 megapixel camera, and a 2.4" or bigger display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our latest Sony Ericsson reviews we've had a hard time finding direct competitors for the corresponding Sony Ericsson phone, but here we seem to have a perfect match in the form of the Nokia 6260 slide. In many ways though, the 6260 actually outperforms the C903.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With almost the same phone dimensions, the Nokia 6260 slide has a bigger resolution of 320 x 480 pixels on its 16M TFT 2.4" display, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g, a 5 MP camera with Carl Zeiss optics and VGA video recording, 200 MB internal memory and faster data speeds (HSDPA 10.2 Mbps). A final conclusion would be impossible with the prices of both phones still unknown, but the spec sheet is a good starting point for comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6260 slide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another attractive offering is the Samsung S7350 Ultra s, also known as the S7350 UltraSlide. This phone was also officially presented for the first time at the MWC in Barcelona. At only 12.6mm it's a very thin slider but this is well at the expense of width and height. The S7350 Ultra s has the advantage over the C903 with its bigger 2.6" 16M TFT display with 240 x 400 pixels resolution, faster HSDPA (7.2 Mbps), WVGA video recording at 30fps, DviX/ XviD codec support and document viewer. The C903 has more camera extras, including dedicated controls, camera shortcuts, and accelerometer sensor for UI auto-rotate, better multimedia application (Media center) as well as TrackID. The same goes for the comparison with the Nokia 6260 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S7350 Ultra s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another MWC newcomer is the LG KT770. This Symbian-based slider has a bigger 2.8" TFT display of WQVGA resolution and again outperforms the C903 in terms of Wi-Fi. Its 5MP camera also packs lots of goodies: geo-tagging, face, smile and blink detection but on top of this records VGA video at 30fps. Faster HSDPA (7.2 Mbps) and a document viewer round off the KT770's advantages over the Sony Ericsson C903.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KT770</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that being said, we come to rounding up our impressions. As we type our final words on the Sony Ericsson C903 review, we are left with nothing but good feelings about this phone. Its story has some ups and downs, but - on the whole - this sweet phone is definitely a positive and pleasing step forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One could grumble about the lack of Wi-Fi, but you cannot expect Sony Ericsson or any other company to incorporate it into every hi-end feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only wish would be to see the superb imaging quality from the camera of the C905 on this baby. It has the same camera quality as on the C902, and that's definitely in need of some improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the materials, phone design, usability and new UI features leave us very satisfied with the Sony Ericsson C903. We cannot comment on the retail price of the phone, but we think it will be almost the same as the Sony Ericsson C902.</paragraph>
