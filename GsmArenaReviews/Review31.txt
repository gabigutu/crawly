			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo wants to redefine smart in smartphone. This affordable little thing was among the first droids to go mass-market. But run-of-the-mill specs don?t mean a boring personality. The HTC Tattoo wears its heart on the sleeve and a shirt for every day of the week means no shortage of sleeves. What do you know, HTC are busy running a tattoo shop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market is a huge part of the deal with every droid phone. The HTC Tattoo has two: a beauty shop and a food store to go to. Back at launch, the QVGA screen resolution wouldn?t let the Tattoo make the best of the Android Market. Things should be different a few months later with more QVGA droids around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo is the unlikeliest of phones to be bored with, but there?s more to this than the custom-designed covers: the Tattoo will be getting the Android 2.1 Éclair update. Nice one, we say: some happy users and a review that?s at least remotely on time. Here go the full specs to get us started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the custom-designed covers that make the HTC Tattoo a unique package, a phone for users who want to express themselves. The unique customization is the right thing perhaps to make an otherwise average smartphone stand out ? and inspire mass users to endorse a new platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top-notch connectivity aside, the HTC Tattoo is a standard smartphone package. This is a first-gen Android with all the inherent weaknesses. On top of that, you get a smallish low-resolution screen. Well, that?s one part of the deal you sign for. But it?s still all fair and square we think when you throw in the reasonable price tag and the chance to express your artistic self.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, is the Tattoo really your kind of phone? You know, even if it?s not, that?s easier to fix than any other phone out there. The HTC Tattoo has been around long enough but it?s keen to offer a new experience every time. Let?s see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OK retail package, could've been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The moderately-sized retail box is not exactly full of stuff but it has the essentials: a charger, a software CD and a miniUSB cable to use with the charger or to transfer data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the box you'll also find a one-piece headset which isn't your only option though since the Tattoo is kind enough to offer a 3.5 mm jack. There are no extra covers obviously. The only bonus item is a 2GB memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Tattoo 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The friendly size is a key asset of the HTC Tattoo. It?s a neat and friendly, and feels surprisingly solid for an all-plastic phone. Standing at 106 x 55.2 x 14 mm this smartphone is no hassle to handle and carry around. At 113 g of weight it?s a stout little handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?re most likely reviewing a phone that has nothing to do with your own HTC Tattoo. But before we look closely at the custom covers, let?s run over the basics. It?s a first generation Android phone and has the typically crowded navigation deck ? including hardware call buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8? touchscreen is on the small side really and the Tattoo is among the few droids using a resistive unit. Maybe it made sense to the designers given the limited screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo is compact and solid and the rounded edges make for a friendlier look and feel. It?s obviously a phone for the young but the graphite paintjob of the handset we?re reviewing certainly gives it a more mature businesslike appearance. It is nicely finished with blending shades of dark and light grey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom covers are the real deal though. And the best thing you don?t only get to change one part of the body. It?s a three-piece suite really, for a complete disguise front and rear. HTC are keen to make money off their neat little tattoo shop here. You can order pre-designed covers or create your own with their customizing tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of options if you decide to indulge your artistic side ? from background color and patterns to various shapes, symbols, images and text. The ready-made covers cost 11.99 euro and the ones you design are 14.99. Either way it?s a bargain for a brand new authentic phone cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our HTC Tattoo though, the front panel does look like it could've accommodated a larger screen but the hardware buttons didn't leave much room for growth. Again, a 2.8" QVGA resistive touchscreen is nothing to write home about really, but it might have been the only choice in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo doesn?t have a stylus (nor is Android designed to be used with a stylus) so the only upside is that you can operate the resistive screen with your gloves on. Resistive units don?t have the sensitivity of capacitive displays and require a stronger push to register the tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is on the small side (the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini had a smaller screen but also a custom UI designed for that screen size). Even though the Sense UI hasn?t been redesigned it?s still easily thumbable (the portrait QWERTY less so though). The other thing is, there won?t be multi touch even when the HTC Tattoo gets the 2.1 Éclair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is decent and, even if QVGA may be feared to make color banding more prominent, it?s not as easily noticeable on a screen this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is poor really. The Tattoo isn?t the best device to work with in the bright sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we only find the earpiece along with a status LED hidden under the grill. The phone has no ambient light sensor or a dedicated camera for video calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Six hardware keys and a circular D-pad with a huge confirm button make for a crowded navigation panel below the screen. The top buttons are rocker styled; accommodating Home and Menu left, and Back and Search right. There are dedicated call keys below and the big round D-pad-like center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are slim and small but are well defined and solid to press. The D-pad can scroll both vertically and sideways but you?re not likely to use it much on a full touch phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, even though they look metallic, they are plastic and we've heard some user reports of some keys metallic finish peeling off. Let's hope it's not a widespread issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Tattoo is the lonely volume rocker, while the right side is completely bare. It would've been nice to find a camera key there. Not essential perhaps given the fixed-focus camera, but wouldn't have hurt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the HTC Tattoo you can find the standard 3.5mm audio jack and - right next to it - the lanyard eyelet. There is no protective cover on the audio jack, but no biggie. Just remember to clean it from time to time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the miniUSB port for connecting the data cable and the charger. Right next to it is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo rear features the 3-megapixel fixed focus camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. No flash whatsoever on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 1100 mAh Li-ion battery that powers the HTC Tattoo. The talk time of the Tattoo is quoted at 7.5 hours, with 520h of standby. Here, you'll also find the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location of the card slot might not be good news to those of you that like using the card for transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bright side though: the phone has microSDHC support and handled our reasonably full 16GB microSD card trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is impressive given the exchangeable covers. We feared creaks and wobbles, but there is no weak spot on the HTC Tattoo. The covers hold firmly in place. Yes, they?re hard to replace but the good news is the handset feels rock solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tattoo is quite comfortable to use too ? compact and pocket-friendly. The custom-designed panels earn it a lot of street cred of course. The Tattoo is the perfect phone for the young ? and a smartphone too. We guess most of its target audience will be more than willing to forgive the screen size and resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Sense UI earns an extra point but QVGA squanders it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Tattoo runs on version 1.6 of the Android OS but the preinstalled Sense UI makes a pretty big difference in terms of user experience. It is basically the same thing you get with the high-flying HTC Hero but for one important difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QVGA resolution doesn?t do the Tattoo user interface justice. We don?t know if it?s the Android downsampling algorithm at fault or simply the overly large pixels but things don?t quite look the usual Android treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QVGA stretched over 2.8 inches seemed fine about a couple of years ago when we hardly knew any better. Then VGA and WVGA screens became the standard and the likes of HTC Tattoo simply don?t rate ? at least not at the top end of the market. But since the HTC Tattoo is not setting its sights on the high end let?s stop this rant and move on to the actual user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow button at the bottom of the screen that pulls up the main menu in stock Android handsets, is now replaced with three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu (this time around, you simply tap - you can't drag the Main Menu out, though you can drag it back in). The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Add to Home" menu. And there's plenty to add to the homescreen but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen is on - it can't be used for actual scrolling. HTC have extended the homescreen to seven panes instead of the usual three. Even if it sounds too much, with all those widgets (which are quite useful too) it may not even be enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most important novelties is the addition of scenes ? a set of custom desktop setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't modify the scenes but if you rearrange the current homescreen you are prompted to save changes as a new scene. The Clean slate scene in turn lets you start from scratch - it's just the default Android setup with a Clock and a few shortcuts underneath. Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal mode that other phones offer seem like quite a limited solution compared to scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changes to the UI that Sense brings go deeper than just the homescreen. For example, the main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch to a list view - similar to what you get in TouchFLO 3D (only available for WinMo at the time). With it, you can use kinetic scrolling or an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a widget to the homescreen you are presented with two options - Android widgets (the stock widgets) and HTC widgets. HTC are obviously quite proud of what they've achieved and with good reason. Some of their widgets even have different versions on offer so you can pick the one that suits you best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget, different look (There are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!) and some even offer different functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the Twitter widget for instance - one version shows updates for the people you follow, while the other version only lets you tweet from the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC widgets offer a better level of interaction than the stock widgets - there's a Favorites widget that keeps a list of your favorite contacts you can scroll through, no need to get to the contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way widgets are moved around on the homescreen has changed too. A green rectangle marks the area the widget will occupy while the rest of the background is faded. If the current section of the homescreen is full, a message urges you to move the widget to another section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is generally fast enough but not as good as on the X10 mini. There are lags every now and then but it?s not as bad as to ruin the whole deal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good looking phonebook does a great job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, HTC have their own vision of what a good phonebook should look like and have tweaked the default Android app with some cool graphics and features of their own. The result is quite satisfactory indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a contact's details presents you with the basic info for the contact - name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs at the bottom and you're just viewing the first tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the text messages received from the contact - it'd have been a lot more useful if it held the entire thread, but for that you have to go to the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact. The next two tabs are quite interesting and can turn the Tattoo into a social networking power tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first holds Facebook contact updates, while the second one called "Albums" pulls the picture albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts and favorite contacts tabs, as well as a call log, groups and "Updates and events". The latter holds updates for all your Facebook contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen has been nicely skinned. There's no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy - just press the search button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony does well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality when making calls with the HTC Tattoo is good and the call volume is decent so you don?t have to keep it at max at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features a keypad and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad) and also boasts Smart dialing. It?s pretty rare for an Android handset to have smart dialing so we believe extra praise is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional loudspeaker test on the HTC Tattoo. It got a Good mark, ranking just above the middle of our table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email with ease. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Androids, if you have only one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and once you hit the icon you?re taken to the Messaging Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS interface is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads. Each thread is labeled by the names of the recipients and shows the number of messages in the thread and part of the last message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as the text box only takes a single line of the screen even if you hide the keyboard, which really only gives you little space to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The automatic suggestions will appear and you can easily select one by tapping it. The Tattoo shows the name and number/email of each of the suggestions so you won?t end up using the wrong number for some of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets. There are a few HTC add-ons, but nothing major. Batch operations, which debuted on the HTC Magic, allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slightly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or the generic mail client, and set one of the two options as default. The reason behind most Android handsets coming with two email clients is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages. At the bottom there are three virtual buttons that change the inbox view to display conversations or only the emails with attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversations tab mimics the Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand. Attachments are not automatically downloaded by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard in the Tattoo works in both portrait and landscape modes. The buttons are on the small side but given the available screen estate you couldn?t actually hope for more now, could you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a SureType kind of QWERTY keyboard where each button is shared by two letters and a regular multitap keypad. We don?t see why someone would actually prefer those for their text input needs but it certainly doesn?t hurt having them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery looks nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo gallery has a new main menu list-with-thumbnail structure to replace the old grid view. The Albums app (that?s its given name) automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder - quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery undertakes reindexing of the content each time you open it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. It?s a bugger really as when your card fills up with content, it takes quite some time to finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a number indicating the count of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. No sign of the camera shortcut that we found so comfortable in the HTC Magic's main gallery. It is only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons - one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and finally - Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images and share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking an image is possible even while browsing Facebook photos, direct uploading is even easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need to download a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Tattoo supports a couple of zooming methods ? you can use the onscreen virtual controls or you can zoom straight to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. Unfortunately zooming and panning isn?t particularly fast and we are slightly disappointed with that. Even when dealing with 3 megapixel images from its own camera the Tattoo will make you wait for a few seconds now and then.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback capabilities are still pretty limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums' subfolder as there is no separate icon for the video player in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared on Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application of HTC Tattoo is identical to the one found on the HTC Hero. That essentially is some pretty basic stuff that doesn?t really do a modern smartphone justice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite as expected, the player is capable of playing only 3GP and MP4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the HTC Tattoo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is also pretty choppy with most videos with resolution above QVGA showing the occasional stutter. In general, the Tattoo seems unfit as a portable video player with a lot to be desired in both software and hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player needs an update too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with the rest of the multimedia department, the music player is also totally redesigned by the Sense UI, but this time there are no extra features added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find that the contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff in YouTube and Google is removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other weaknesses of the Android platform music player that still need addressing are no equalizer presets, and no alternative player skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo surprised us with its audio output which is slightly better than that of the Hero. The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk remain strong points of its performance and this time the frequency response is excellent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortion levels have also been improved and while still not the best in class are still pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty poor camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera with no flash of any kind. That should be enough to keep your expectations reasonably low, but even then the Tattoo manages to disappoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is pretty simple with little controls and few customization options. There is a camera/camcorder switch and a gallery button. The confirm button serves as a shutter key. Since there is no autofocus the lack of a dedicated shutter key with half-press action is no big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the viewfinder reveals the digital zoom bar on the left. Hitting the "Menu" reveals five buttons on a tab at the bottom of the screen, the latter leading to an advanced settings menu. There you can set the metering mode, sharpness, saturation and contrast of the photos and you can add a viewfinder gridline to assist your framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick settings appearing in the viewfinder handle image resolution, white balance and brightness. You can also activate a self-timer (2 to 10 second lag) from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can guess the available options are quite outdated as there's no sign of stuff such as face, smile or blink detection, automatic panos, full resolution burst shooting modes and other modern stuff that has long been available on cell phone cameras. At least geotagging of photos is available as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make matters even worse the HTC Tattoo image quality is poor. The phone insisted on underexposing, producing dark images with undeveloped shadows. Not to mention the excessive sharpening that adds a huge number of artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of resolved detail isn?t that bad and the colors are close enough but the general result is plain bad. You can check it out in the photos below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC Tattoo. You can check out what that test is all about here. Again it?s hardly the best performer we have seen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo video isn?t much of a treat either. The phone captures CIF video at 15 fps, which is almost as good as no video recording. Bringing the resolution down to QVGA increases the framerate and fixes things up a bit but videos still don?t get as smooth as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera's. It sports a setting for picking between MP4 and 3GP (H.263) encoding, which theoretically should give you the choice between smaller file and a higher-quality video. In practice the low resolution makes sure that the differences aren't really so obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides all the negative comments about the still images are valid for the videos too so in the end you don?t have much usable footage.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo offers excellent connectivity at a bargain price. 7.2Mbps HSDPA, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 are the highlights but the handset also features quad-band GSM and USB 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing the connectivity options can be done via the Main Menu by looking up Wireless controls under Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Sense UI implemented in the Tattoo, there are quick homescreen widgets for turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on or off. If you have already configured wireless networks or previously paired devices, they will be connected automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi support is excellent. It's very easy to get running, with no need to dig in the menus or meddle with various settings. Just click on the desired network, type a password if needed and there you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth support is far from being so good though. It's limited to headset use and does not support file transfers. At least the A2DP support is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing your data couldn't be easier - it's just that you mainly sync with the Google services. For those of you who prefer desktop syncing with Outlook or Outlook Express, the HTC Sync comes in handy. It is a nice tool for quick syncing your contacts and calendar events with PC (Outlook) and works just fine for all HTC Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tattoo can be used as a USB 3G modem under Windows. You need to connect your device to a PC with HTC Sync installed. When done, you should enable the ?Mobile network sharing? setting in the USB to PC menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great browser suffers the resolution penalty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo comes with the traditionally cool Android web browser with snappy and intuitive UI but loses points on the QVGA display. With this kind of pixel count only a small part of most pages can fit the screen and still be legible so you will need to do lots of panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Flash support of any kind, which is another pity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the Tattoo browser is acceptably fast (though we have seen better) and the interface clean. The application is based on the same open source WebKit platform which promises some pretty decent user experience. Pages load decently fast and sweeping gestures work pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The form auto complete functionality and password manager score another point for the Tattoo browser. The web browser also rendered well most of the pages we threw at it and we are very pleased with the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the option to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves nice transition effects.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo came without a document viewer, so we headed to the Android Market to find one. We found only a couple of options and both were trial versions (it could be because the Tattoo runs an older version of Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out OfficeSuite Viewer to find it handled all types of Office documents (including the Office 2007 versions) along with PDF and even ZIP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, so you can view attachments. Unfortunately, you can?t save them to the phone memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo features an alarm clock application which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Footprints app allows you to geo-tag images and save them in diverse categories such as favorites, shopping, dining, etc accompanied by a personal note. Once you take a picture of a place you can look up its address and location using Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, comes the YouTube app which, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo comes with a very capable GPS receiver that quickly got a lock and didn?t loose it even without a clear view of the sky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the HTC Tattoo as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is available only in the US, but even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the most fun part of Google Maps. It gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available (North America, parts of South America, parts of Europe and other locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location. The compass itself is not the most accurate we?ve seen, but does the job well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market offers a lot of alternative SatNav apps for those outside the US, some of them free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Nexus One review, we tried out Wisepilot and AndNav! 2 and those are just a couple of the options available. They both download map data off the Internet (like Google Maps does) but AndNav! 2 has the option to preload the data, which is great for those without a data plan.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QVGA screen is limiting the HTC Tattoo in terms of compatible content on the Android market. The market applies automatic filtering, listing only applications compatible with the QVGA resolution. There is a way around this, of course, but it involves rooting your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the number of compatible applications must have increased since the launch of the Tattoo. And it's only likely to keep going up now that more QVGA droids are emerging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists sub-categories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ?Just in?, the apps and games that were just entered into the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screen shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is that before you install an app, you are warned about what the app can access on your phone ? the internal memory, your location, use the phone (e.g. make a call), connect to the Internet. This is great because it?s easy to spot apps that can be potentially malicious or ones that can incur data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tattoo took the plunge to a lower segment of the smartphone market to give Android some fresh air and open space. It was quite a while ago really but now that more and more droids are keen to think small, let?s see how it works for one of the pace setters. Compact size and reasonable price tag, the HTC Tattoo was among the first to try and sell Android to the masses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tattoo will undoubtedly benefit from a recent surge in QVGA droids: the Android Market is always busy anyway but more native applications available are undoubtedly welcome. Not to mention the one-of-a-kind customization which lets it stay fresh (on the outside at least) for years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course it?s not all rosy in the Tattoo garden. QVGA resolution is the Android way of staying within budget but Symbian will offer you nHD res even cheaper. It?s a matter of touchscreen experience against hardware and price tag, says the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>One should also make sure not to miss the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini if looking for a cheap and compact Android. The baby XPERIA doesn?t exactly fit the bill for cheap but is as compact as they get these days. The X10 mini pulls better imaging and overall performance which is not to be ignored as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If the low-res screen is a deal breaker, take a look at the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica. It matches all the major features of the Tattoo and doubles the pixel count, but at an obviously higher price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Then, there?s the HTC Touch2 for the unconvinced by Android. Coming with the Sense UI, it will make sure user experience feels familiar. A PocketPC in an equally compact package and signed by HTC ? there must be plenty of users who believe they can?t go wrong with that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that said, the HTC Tattoo doesn?t seem to have a direct rival in the classical sense of the word. There isn?t another handset with the exact same price tag and a close enough feature set to make the choice between the two strictly a mater of brand loyalty. And finding a niche is always a good thing, especially in the mid-range segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even that aside, the HTC Tattoo is a pretty attractive package: customizable to the point of being one-of-a-kind, nice and shiny interface (well, QVGA but still), decent performance and a reasonable price tag. Cool and friendly smartphone, unbothered by the high-end hustle and bustle.</paragraph>
