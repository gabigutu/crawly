			<paragraph>The elegant case of the new Nokia 6120 houses a feature rich smartphone, which has all the reasons in the world to become a bestseller</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia 6120 Classic belongs to neither the multimedia N Series, nor the business E series of the Finnish brand. Good at the essentials, it's set of features can't be clearly linked to a particular target of users. The "Classic" attribute refers to the phone's conservative design. On the other hand, Nokia 6120 features functions far more sophisticated than what you'd expect in this price category. The piece we tested had been delivered to us by Vodafone thus its software is modified according to Vodafone's requirements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Chromium enclosing black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 impresses with its conservative, adornment-free design. The unobtrusively elegant and compact handset has two color versions: black and pearl white. The chromium trim is an especially attractive highlight on the black one we tested. The Nokia 6120 puts on no shows; it looks like just another basic phone. Market success is staked on precisely this combination of regular looks and spot-on capability. Despite the all but orthodox use of materials, dominated by standard plastic, the Nokia 6120 stands out with its conservative elegance. Durable and solid, the phone is meant for heavy workloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 is sure to surprise you when you hold it in hand for the first time. It is doubtlessly the smallest and lightest Symbian smartphone on the market. Measuring 105 x 46 x 15 mm and weighing 89 grams, it scores very high in direct comparison to the famous Nokia 6300 (whose dimensions are similar: 106 x 44 x 12 mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most prominent element on Nokia 6120 is the chromium stripe running along the sides of its body. It's wider at the bottom, creating a nice frame for the front to stand out. Round edges dominate the shape and most of the elements of the exterior. The D-pad is chromium-plated too, and so is the framing of the front camera lens and the earpiece. The last silvery bit is the area around the main camera lens on the back. The rest, which is to say most of the surface, is glossy black. Fingerprints are hence an inevitable consequence. They are most likely to appear around the display and on the entire back panel. A good deal of wiping up will be needed every time the phone gets used. Possibly, fingerprints will be less of a problem for the pearl white version of the 6120.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single key is to be found on the top of the handset. The power key has the usual range of powers: it turns the device on and off, switches between profiles (incl. Offline mode), activates phone lock and keypad lock (the standard combination of left soft key + asterisk will do too). The bottom features all connectors - the miniUSB port, 2.5 mm jack, and the charger port. On the left you will find the monospeaker grill and the microSD memory card slot. On the right are the volume rocker and the camera key. The back of the phone nests the main camera lens alongside a pleasingly powerful LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rearside edges are slightly beveled, making for a pleasantly comfortable grip. The plate holds firmly and gives out no strange sounds even when pressed strongly. Under the rear plate is the Li-Ion BL-5B battery with 890 mAh capacity. The battery life of Nokia 6120 is impressive. To give you an example, a daily average of 5 minutes of calls and 20 SMS requires charging every four to five days. More demanding jobs, including active internet browsing in UMTS, will surely reduce durability to 2-3 days, but even so the phone does great. Charging takes about 2.5 hours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad for SMS lovers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The market success of most phones often depends on their keypad. The one in Nokia 6120 is fast and easy to use. Its keys are made of hard plastic; they feature good elevation and precise response, making mistypes a rarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users with larger fingers may be let down by the D-pad. The bulging edges of the keys however are a sort of compensation. The Navi scroll key is remarkably pleasing. Unlike other Symbian Nokia models, the Nokia 6120 lacks a "pencil" key. The "smartness" of the phone is only indicated by the Menu key with the Symbian pictogram.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the right side of the handset show remarkable rigidity and are thus less comfortable to use than the rest. Keypad backlighting is white and even. The Navi scroll key is not directly illuminated, but is still usable enough thanks to the sufficient lighting around it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Master of displays, as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Some readers may disagree, but I dare say that all phone manufacturers should learn from Nokia how to make displays. Nokia uses reflexive surfaces, which enormously improve display legibility under all possible conditions and, above all, in direct sunlight. Having long been used in PDA, reflexive and trans-reflexive folios are no news. In fact, Motorola used to have them in its earlier models. The question is why manufacturers stopped using those folios, or more precisely, why is it only Nokia that uses them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic has an active TFT display with QVGA resolution of 320x240 pixels, totaling 16.7 million colors on a 2" diagonal. Legibility is brilliant. Backlighting is even, animation is fine, and pixels are almost invisible. Color saturation and contrast are great too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screensaver mode is where we came across an unpleasant surprise. The typical bar with time and date, and notifications would just turn off after a few moments. The user is thus unaware about, say, incoming messages. We find that hard to believe given the high level of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Classic Symbian and Series 60<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic is a Series 60 3rd Edition phone running on the latest Symbian 9.2 OS. The same OS is present in other Nokia models like N95, N76, or 6110 Navigator. If you're not new to the Series 60 smartphones, you'll feel comfortable with 6120 classic. The consistently intuitive control is a strong advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by a 369 MHz ARM processor. Applications are assigned approximately 20 MB of RAM. The system is fast and amazingly responsive. The 6120 Classic feels lightning fast compared to other Nokia models. The 6680 or the newer and widely popular N73 would sometimes make you wait before they run an application (the Message Editor, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Status details appearing on the display are the usual stuff: battery status and signal strength, including connection availability (GPRS, EDGE or 3G) are on both ends at the top. In-between are the operator logo, and a digital or analog clock. Date displays in Normal profile, else you get the name of the currently active other profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also available is the active stand-by - a popular feature of smartphones, which is now to be found even in the lowlier Series 40 phones. The active stand-by in Nokia 6120 consists of 6 user-defined shortcuts allowing instant access to frequently used applications. The space beneath the active-standby icons is reserved for displaying calendar events and tasks, message or call notifications, the name of the track or radio station currently playing. The active stand-by mode can be turned off. Alternatively, you can assign a shortcut to each of the four ways of the navigation key. The last thing to note about the display is the context keys, which can also serve as shortcuts. You can choose between 90 functions and locations within the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be displayed as a grid of 4 x 3 icons (to us, the best option) and as a list. Horseshow and V-shape views are also available, though their usability is doubtful. The distribution of icons is user-configurable, as well as their location in different menu levels. Intuitive access is enabled, as always, with alphanumeric keys serving as shortcuts, each corresponding to an icon within the grid. Minimized but still active applications have their icons signposted by a blue mark. Active applications are recalled by pressing and holding the Menu key, and are closed by pressing the Clear key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were testing a Vodafone-locked handset, which had 5 color schemes. Additional themes can be downloaded from the Internet or obtained via Bluetooth or data cable. Voice control is one of the most helpful options in new Symbian smartphones and Nokia 6120, being no exception, features it too. Voice control works in a simple way: choose from the provided list the application you want to access by a voice command and forget about the rest. The phone configures the voice settings on its own; all you need to do is press and hold the right context key and say the name of the desired application. You'll encounter very little problems with command recognition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls wherever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 will not display simultaneously the contacts from the phonebook and the SIM. The number of phonebook entries is practically unlimited, only depending on free memory. There's an unusually wide range of assignable fields for each contact, including PushToTalk and internet telephone. The phonebook is searchable by gradual typing. Contacts can be organized in groups, assigned a ringtone and speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120's doesn't support 3-D tones, as opposed to some of the other Finnish smartphones. The phone still offers an extensive array of profile setup options. Standard calls can be set apart from video calls by ringtone. Audio quality during calling is very good. The voice in the earpiece is clear and balanced. The opposite party expressed no concerns about microphone quality, either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to older Symbian devices, the Messages menu brings no novelties. All messages are managed by one and the same editor. Additional options vary according to the type of message you're composing. There are three font size options to choose from; predictive input goes without saying. Nokia 6120 classic will read out your messages provided they are typed in English. The character counter displays the number remaining for the chunk of text to be sent as a stand-alone message. The number in brackets refers to the count of chunks in a multipart message. The hash key has some of the capabilities of a pencil, which in Nokia 6120 Classic is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an email client, which works with SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 protocols. It manages several accounts simultaneously and supports attachments. Naturally, it can be configured to download either headers only, or entire messages, as well as to automatically check mail. The built-in Setup Guide will help you configure the email client. PushToTalk and message delivery notifications are here, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Storage space for messages is only limited by the available memory, be it phone or card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Shipshape and on-the-dot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several applications in the Organizer, calendar the key one, of course. It hasn't changed, which is to say, it's the good old performer. It offers a month, week, and a day view. Four event types are available: meeting, memo, anniversary, and to-do. Meetings can repeat daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or annually. Tasks can be displayed separately and, once accomplished, can be marked as done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the calendar, here you will also find simple text notes, a unit converter and a calculator, which is too basic for a smartphone. There's also a clock application with several repeated alarm-clocks, and a world time function. The voice recorder has been notably enhanced since the last Nokia smartphone: recordings can now be as long as 60 minutes, which should satisfy 99% of all users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features the Quickoffice application for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents; browsing is fast. Text can be zoomed-in and out, as well as searched. However, the basic version of Quickoffice does not include an editing option. A 15-Euro special upgrade will give you editing capability. Nokia 6120 offers an Adobe PDF viewer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fun &amp; music: classics are always appreciated<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Music performance is excellent. The music player in Nokia 6120 classic departs a bit from the players integrated in the N Series. It plays an enormous amount of formats (AAC, AAC+. eAAC+, MP3, MP4, M4A, WMA, RealAudio 7, 8, 10, True tones, WAV). Album covers can be visualized too. The name of the current track appears beneath the album's image. Songs can be organized in playlists by various criteria. Audio performance can be modified, adjusted to user's preferences thanks to a 4-band equalizer. Bass settings, extended stereo and echo effect are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many will hail the presence of an FM radio receiver. It lacks RDS, but features Visual Radio on the other hand. The radio offers a total of 50 slots for saving stations. Both the music player and the radio player can be minimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic offers three games: the well-known Marble, the Tetris-look-alike City Bloxx and the HighRoller Casino, which is basically a combination of five very popular card games. All three games are sufficiently entertaining and we highly recommend them. In our case Vodafone had added other 5 game demo versions: Sims 2, Tetris, Asphalt III 3D, Midnight Pool 3D, and Midnight Bowling 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>In line with the Online<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the slowest type of connections. CSD is not worth mentioning, but HSCSD is available, because there might still be users who use it. The multi-slot Class 32 EDGE/GPRS deserves attention. UMTS/HSDPA support makes things even sweeter with data transfer rate soaring to potentially 3.6 Mb/s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi is the only connection Nokia 6120 classic misses. Pity indeed. Bluetooth 2.0 supports A2DP and AVRCP for using third party wireless stereo headsets. When the phone is connected via a miniUSB cable, Mass storage is available and the content stored on the memory card appears as a separate storage device. The menu also offers a special mode for working with the Nokia PC Suite and Windows Media Player over an MTP protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic sports one of the most sophisticated Internet browsers to ever come in a phone. It changes font size and displays pages in landscape mode. In addition, it browses the pages saved in the History folder by displaying previews only. Images and flash animation can be deactivated to bring down the transferred data count. The Internet browser has an RSS-feed reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera not up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No, it's not. Its 2-megapixel resolution fails to impress. While 2 megapixel could still pass, the lack of auto focus and lens cover is a shame. In the same time, the LED flash is worth a compliment. It only gets activated when shooting and cannot be used as a flashlight at night. It does work great in shooting close-ups, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is held horizontally when taking pictures. The user interface is quite straightforward. Editing options and effects are not available in the camera application. They can be used in the Gallery, once the picture has been taken. Among them is a panorama mode, combining two shots (the only interesting option, in fact). Twilight and sequence modes are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 records video in QVGA resolution of 320 x 240 pixels at 15 fps. Zooming (only digital though) can be applied during filming too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliantly conceived<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic is an accomplished phone. Offering great performance at rather moderate price, it will stand up to any competitor. Its conservative but very elegant looks will not appeal to teenage users, but will surely enjoy great demand in other market segments. Taking aside the few disappointments like the camera, Nokia 6120 offers a near complete range of up to date features: a superb display, nearly all existing mobile communication capabilities, and super fast interface. Looking for a new phone and not into putting on shows? Then Nokia 6120 Classic should be on your shortlist. At around 250 euros it's definitely worth it.</paragraph>
