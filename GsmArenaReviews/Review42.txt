			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson is an alliance of two tech giants and with phones like the Vivaz it shows. It?s a gadget all the way, one that will galvanize geeks and charm the regular user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A whole bunch of point-and-shoot cameras today boast 720p video recording, but are they not an endangered species feeling enormous pressure on both sides? For one, there are compact video recording DSLRs pushing down with competitive price tags, and then cameraphones are eating into compact camera territory with comparable still image resolution and video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eight megapixel still images and 720p video with continuous auto focus make the Sony Ericsson Vivaz a predator of point-and-shoot cameras. The Vivaz is not just a cameraphone though, it?s a smartphone as well ? a tricked out Symbian running on a 720MHz CPU with a 3.2? nHD display to show it all off. That?s all in a package more compact than any combination of a stand-alone camera and a phone you can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High-end smartphones have a long history of trading compact size for cramming in one feature more than the competition. The Sony Ericsson Vivaz strikes a perfect balance between being compact and feature-full ? great news for anyone who doesn?t appreciate the recent craze of smartphones the size of a table? umm? tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature list leaves very little to complain about, so is it time retire your old compact camera and make the jump the Vivaz? That?s what we?ll try to find out. As for its performance as a smartphone the list of key features suggests smooth sailing most of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hold on to your hats folks, we?re jumping into the hardware part of this review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Vivaz 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 107 x 51.7x 12.5 mm the Sony Ericsson Vivaz is smaller than it appears in the photos ? it will slip right into any pocket. It tips the scales at the neat 97 grams and that?s quite an advantage over the majority of competitors. For its impressive list of features, it?s a very compact phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent trend in Sony Ericsson design ? the curved back ? makes another appearance on the Vivaz. It helps the phone fit snugly in your palm, and the device feels even more compact and friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz follows in the footsteps of the Symbian S60 5th edition phones that came before it. A touchscreen with nHD resolution (360 x 640 pixels) and three buttons bellow ? the menu key in the middle, call keys on the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz shares a lot of DNA with the Satio and it looks it, but the top and bottom are curved, which breaks away from the rectangular front of the Satio. By the way, we were amazed by the uncanny resemblance with LG Viewty Smart. That?s looks though, the Vivaz feel is indeed superior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz comes in four color versions: Silver Moon, Cosmic Black, Galaxy Blue, Venus Ruby. We?re having the pleasure of the Silver Moon variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the Vivaz is almost entirely made of plastic but this phone is among the rare few that don?t make us miss metal so badly. Metal would have brought up the weight too ? at 97 grams it?s one of the lightest phones with a display of 3? or more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front of the Vivaz is taken up by the 3.2" touchscreen with a resolution of 640 x 360 pixels. The resistive unit supports up to 16M colors and is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the device. It has nice picture quality with excellent contrast for a TFT unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resistive displays generally need more pressure to get a click registered. As we found out though, the Vivaz screen response is excellent. The resistive technology is certainly not a drawback here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the sunlight legibility is poor ? the Vivaz does slightly better than the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, which has a screen with the same size, resolution and touch technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is at the top, along with an ambient light sensor. There?s no proximity sensor or an auto-locking feature, so the display is always susceptible to incidental presses during a call. Perhaps they?ll fix that in a future software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware keys below the display are a bit too thin but still usable. At least they blend quite nicely with the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz features the 3.5mm audio jack at the very top, a microUSB port just bellow it and the loudspeaker a bit further down. The microUSB port is covered by a plastic flap. The Vivaz, along with the XPERIAs, seems to have broken the FastPort curse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side hosts an array of controls. In the top half, there?s the volume rocker, which also doubles as a digital zoom control. The bottom half offers not one but two shutter keys ? one for the still camera and one for the camcorder. Between the volume rocker and the shutters, there?s an otherwise hidden LED that flashes when you turn the camera on in either mode. Above the volume rocker is another light that shines red while the phone is charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz is placed at the top. As on any other Symbian handset, you can also use the power key for locking the phone (in this case double clicking the power key is enough), switching profiles or handling the memory card. All there is at the bottom is the lanyard eyelet and a mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz reveals its standout feature ? the camera. The 8MP lens is unusually placed almost in the middle of the phone and is left completely unprotected. There is a LED flash, the main purpose of which is to serve as a video light. A small red light next to the camera blinks during recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The placement of the camera is uncommon but there?s a very good reason for putting it where it is. You can hold the Sony Ericsson Vivaz very comfortably with two hands without risk of smudging the lens with your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover on the Vivaz reveals the 1200 mAh Li-Po EP500 battery (the bulkier Satio had a 1000 mAh one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to test its performance properly, and we'll update this part of the review soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is below the battery cover, though not under the battery itself. The Vivaz comes with an 8GB microSD card in the package and supports up to 16GB cards. The SIM card slot is here too ? the two card compartments flank the battery. The SIM slot solution is simple ? you can just slide the card in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black plastic around the display and the display itself will quickly become a fingerprint mess. The plastic on the back is glossy too but on the Silver Moon prints are as good as invisible. The other color versions don?t fare as well however, especially the Cosmic Black, as we were able to confirm ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic on the sides of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz appears black, but it?s actually dark blue (it?s blue in all but the Venus Ruby version) and reflects the light in an interesting way as you tilt the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz is very compact ? it?s smaller than the Samsung S8000 Jet but packs a slightly bigger display as the bezel around the screen is quite thin. All the controls are easily reachable and despite being quite thin, they should be easy enough to use even if you have big fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved back of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz lets it sit more naturally in the hand but it?s not too pronounced so it still fits well into pockets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is solid enough, but there?s a noticeable gap between the display glass and the sides of the phone that quickly accumulates dust. All in all, it?s a well-built handset using quality plastics. Compact and lightweight, the Vivaz is a very friendly device, and beautifully styled too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Neat and stylish UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz runs the Symbian OS 5th edition but you'd never tell by just looking at the homescreen. It's quite different from how other manufacturers see the touch-operated Symbian. In a nutshell, if you are familiar with the Satio, Vivaz won't be a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starers, we've prepared a short video demo of the Vivaz user interface. It should give you a better idea of most of the changes introduced by Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen uses a tabbed interface but not like the "Vertical icon bar" often seen (though rarely used) in Nokia handsets. There are five tabs, which are in effect five alternative homescreen panes. You can assign a different function to every tab - favorite contacts, flow animation, camera album, shortcuts, static picture, Flash animation or the Twitter app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five shortcuts on top of the display, one for each tab. Alternatively, horizontal finger sweeps can be used to navigate the tabs. The transition itself is visually pleasing with its smooth animations - even if you switch from the first to the last tab, things will roll across the screen with no lag at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no home tab this time, you can show or hide the status window with a hit on the End key. At the bottom of the screen you get the operator name, time and date (though time is also visible in the status row on top) and music controls. The music controls act as a shortcut to the music player and if there's a song playing it will display track info (with album art) and basic player controls. There are four additional shortcuts at the bottom - Dialer, Media, Messaging and Web search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a closer look at those tabs. They are very similar to the XPERIA panels, but we might say they offer more functionality and style. The five tabs are actually slots that you can assign your choice of content. Well, almost - you are limited to one of the eight options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is the Favorite contacts option, which makes the homescreen tab show a selection of contacts. They are displayed in a list with contact photos if available, so nothing fancy. Tapping a contact, brings up a popup with three options - Call, Message, View in contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album option shows a vertical list of all your photos and videos, sorted by date. It comes with kinetic scrolling and is the fastest way to view the latest photos. By the way, for some strange reason kinetic scrolling is not available anywhere else throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Shortcuts option , which puts a list of eight shortcuts on your tab - be they shortcuts to applications or bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have the option of setting a tab to show a single picture or a Flash animation, while the third option displays running water as an interactive (accelerometer-based) animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final one is the Twitter option, which speaks for itself. It's a homescreen Twitter tab allowing you to read or post tweets on your profile. We wish there was a Facebook option as well, but who know, perhaps developers will be able to answer to that and add many more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz main menu is more standard - there's a choice between grid and list arrangement, and by default the shortcuts are arranged so that they resemble the typical Sony Ericsson menu. The icons will feel very familiar to experienced Sony Ericsson or Symbian users, depending on the theme you are currently using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest however is S60 5th edition - the D-pad and soft-key based navigation translated into touchscreen. Lists still require a double tap to select and confirm, while icons take just a single tap. There's a shortcut to the task switcher or you can long-press the menu key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony still needs smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Sony Ericsson Vivaz. Reception levels are good on both ends of a call, the earpiece is loud enough and there was no interference whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two things the phone lacks are Smart dialing and voice dialing. These two are included in other versions of Symbian and should have been available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Form the options menu you can find more settings like hold call, mute, lock screen and keys, switch to video call, new call, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can silence an incoming call on the phone by simply flipping it over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, your screen doesn't switch off during a call, because the lack of a proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on Vivaz. The handset didn't perform too well scored a Below average mark meaning we have seen (and heard) much better. You might want to keep a closer look on it when it's noisy around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is typical Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz uses the standard Symbian S60 5th edition phonebook. It has virtually unlimited capacity and functionality is among the best we've seen. You can set whether the contacts on the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can order contacts by first or last name and you can naturally search any contact by gradual typing. To speed things along, the search keyboard is special - letters are in alphabetical order and not the entire alphabet is available. For instance, if there are no contacts whose name starts with a C, the letter C won't appear on the custom keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one that's missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign personal sound ringtones and videos to the individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the standby screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Call Log from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging menu is yet another part of the Symbian S60 UI that hasn't been modified at all since the Nokia 5800, apart from some minor reskinning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar. When composing an SMS, a counter is displayed of characters left up to a limit of 160. An indicator in brackets shows the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you insert some multimedia content or an email address as recipient, the character counter is replaced by a data counter showing the size of your email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz also features a dedicated audio message recorder. Much like with Symbian S60 v3.2, you can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can activate delivery reports - they come up on the screen as simple pop ups and are automatically saved in a dedicated messaging folder after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. It prompts you to choose whether you prefer POP or IMAP access to mail providers that support both. However, it failed to fetch the email settings automatically for our Gmail account so we had to do it by hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can check for new mail automatically at a preset interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available when you compose emails offline. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Vivaz. You can also subscribe to multiple folders, so you can check email in folders other than the Inbox, e.g. the Starred folder in Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing emails is a bit weird - sweeping your finger selects text and prompts you to copy it. This means you have to use the scrollbar. Easily copying text is great but we would have liked some way to toggle between scrolling and selecting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments and signatures - the Vivaz meets virtually all your email needs, and with a screen resolution like this, reading emails on the device is a real pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The text input options cover everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz offers a complete selection of input methods. The handset has a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad in both portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It definitely cannot be a match for any hardware keyboard but the Vivaz full QWERTY fares pretty well. Typing is enhanced by accurate haptic feedback and the keys are large enough for typos to be reduced to a healthy minimum. Unfortunately, there is no predictive typing like on the Apple iPhone or the Nokia E71, but we do not consider this much of a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a mini version of the QWERTY keyboard which is only good for stylus use, typing with fingers is possible but it's a real test of your patience. Its main advantage is that it takes little space on the screen and can be moved around so it doesn't block your view of things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Ericsson Vivaz offers handwriting recognition and actually does a rather decent job of it, recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve performance by taking the handwriting training - this is where you actually show the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian file management system has been top notch for quite a while now, and it's difficult to imagine what needs to change. The application can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a specific file or directory is also available on the phone. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card) Vivaz will find it for you in no time. There's also a dedicated Search app, which searches through more than just files - it will sift through your notes, contacts, pretty much anything on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media center: Sony Ericsson know their drill<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz Media center is a replica of what you usually find on the company's feature phones (and Sony Playstations, mind you) - an attractive and convenient way of accessing the media content on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson used the tight Media layout just like in the Satio, and there are only the three essential shortcuts to make up the main media center menu - Photo, Music and Video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may've already guessed, the first one will lead you to the main gallery with all its various options available. The second give access to the Walkman player and all playlists. Finally, the third one will take you to all the video clips stored on the Vivaz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo gallery is the same as in the Satio and definitely among the best we've seen: with great customization capabilities and features aplenty. Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, timeline view for your images and tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tags are a very helpful feature offering better ways to make albums - a photo can have multiple tags, which you can't do with folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos is a joy with the Vivaz, especially when browsing images fullscreen. When you want to go to the next in line, it doesn't simply pop up but instead slides in from left or right. The selected photo expands smoothly to fill the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can reveal all the available options by tapping on the screen - delete, edit, use as, assign to contact, slideshow, print tag, rotate, information, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Pictures section, which stores all the preloaded images that were not taken with the phone's inbuilt camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walkman on Symbian really works</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz comes with the Walkman music player with all the implied features but not all the usual eye-candy. Much like the rest of the media menu, the accelerometer is used here for automatic rotation of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to listen to. The "Now playing" screen is simple but offers all the needed controls and information. The tracks are controlled by comfortably large and thumbable on-screen keys at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the Vivaz offered neither equalizers nor alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player plays HD, but doesn't have DivX/XviD support</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Sony Ericsson Vivaz has pretty limited functionality compared to the one found on the company's features phones. It has neither slow-mo playback nor screenshot capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our real grudge with the video player however is that there's no DivX and XviD support - what can we say, LG and Samsung handsets have definitely spoiled us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the missing support for the extremely popular codecs, either you'll have to buy a new application for video playback or you'll have to convert all your videos by using MediaGo (with all the imposed limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the watching experience itself, the Vivaz is nothing short of flawless. High resolution, excellent image quality and 16:9 aspect ratio make for a really nice video combo indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz has memory for 20 stations and dones not support RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz isn't the loudest of them handset as far as headphones volume is concerned. However when subjected to our traditional audio quality test it showed a decent overall performance with even a few excellent marks here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk are particularly impressive, while the distortion levels are both pretty decent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off extreme bass frequencies are the only slight shortfall of the Vivaz frequency response. However it is excellent for the rest of the audible range so no biggie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vivaz can snap some nice shots<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz packs an 8-megapixel camera and is capable of taking photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels. It also sports a LED flash, but its serves video better than the still images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz camera interface is reasonably comfortable with the viewfinder occupying only the central part of the screen when you select regular 4:3 aspect ratio. When shooting in 16:9 aspect ratio, however, the whole display is put to use from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the viewfinder there are five shortcuts. Those cover Scenes, Shoot mode, Focus settings, Exposure compensation and Auto mode. When you select Auto mode the handset takes care of applying the most appropriate scene settings for your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu gives you another set of customizable options. Those include self-timer, white balance, flash on/off, effects, image stabilizer and picture size. You can also choose whether you'll see a preview of every taken snapshot and if the image orientation should be recorded in the EXIF info. The camcorder part of the camera supports a very similar set of customizable settings except the image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A high-end cameraphone, the Sony Ericsson Vivaz naturally comes with image geo-tagging too. There is also face and smile-detection, as well as panorama mode and Touch capture. In fact, its options resemble the Satio features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name suggests, Touch capture allows you to focus on any particular subject in the frame by simply tapping on it in the viewfinder. The Vivaz will automatically focus on it and take the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the idea of two separate shutter keys too - for taking photos and capturing videos. The only disadvantage is the slight risk of hitting the wrong one and missing an interesting moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz produces splendid photos. The colors are vibrant and rich (too bad we don't have the weather to prove it), the amount of resolved detail is very good and the noise levels are low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no over sharpening or purple fringing. Had the amount of resolved detail and contrast been just a tad more, we surely would've called it the ultimate camera on a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Sony Ericsson Vivaz samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vivaz edges out Omnia HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz captures 720p videos at 24 fps, venturing to kick the Samsung Omnia HD out of its complacency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the best new feature of the Vivaz is the continuous auto focus during video recording. That's definitely a first for any cameraphone and it allows it to act just like a dedicated video camera. We've compiled a demo video to show you the benefits of the technology. Hello, macro videos!</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really positive thing is that the video framerate is steady, never dropping below 24 frames per second. If you remember, in most of the videos the Omnia HD was obviously struggling to reach the desired 24 frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many users are concerned about the difference between the 24fps and 30fps. The truth is both are equally fine and if you see the same footage shot at both framerates, chances are you're going to like the 24fps one better. All cinema movies (including the blockbuster Avatar) are shot at 24fps so watching those looks more natural. Bear in mind though that currently YouTube converts all uploaded videos to 29.97 fps, so uploading to YouTube won't yield the best possible result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know what you are about to ask, so here it is in plain language: yes, we think that once the contrast is fixed, the Vivaz videos will outdo those by Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz has an edge over Omnia HD in audio recording too. Currently, the Vivaz videos use AAC audio with 48kHz sampling rate, while those by the Omnia HD have a sampling rate of 16kHz. And you can definitely tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a direct comparison of the videos recorded by Sony Ericsson Vivaz and the Samsung Omnia HD to give you a better idea. Plus it's the only full-res video sample of the Vivaz that we'll publish due to the large file size.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vivaz HD video has its own flaws though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The quality of the Sony Ericsson Vivaz videos is nice with reasonably well-resolved detail and faithful colors. Still there are a few things to nitpick about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Vivaz is still not a completely ready product, so improvements to video recording may as well be under way. But here's our two cents the way we see it now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, the videos definitely need some increase in contrast. Slightly higher resolved detail is another thing, but it's optional since we guess increasing the micro contrast and adding some sharpening may add for a subjective feel of added resolution. Finally, we would definitely appreciate a bit pimped up colors - currently they look washed out at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last bugger that we'll mention is the nasty rolling shutter effect and unfortunately, a fix for that is highly unlikely. At times the jello-like line skewing effect makes videos look like shot by a really cheap camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz is well versed in connectivity - all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics, there's quad-band GSM and EDGE support, as well as 3G network compatibility. The Vivaz has dual-band 900/2100 MHz support for worldwide coverage, as well as an American version at 850/1900/2100 MHz. Data speeds reach up to 10.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity offers the obligatory Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. Vivaz also comes with Wi-Fi, which includes DLNA support. The wired connectivity relies on the microUSB port, a real advantage over the Satio's FastPort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are keen to jump ship recently with microSD cards, not Memory Sticks. The card slot on the Vivaz is hot-swappable, but it's hidden under the battery cover. It supports cards with a capacity of up to 16GB (it comes with an 8GB card in the box), which is more free space than we've ever needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser needs more work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Vivaz uses the S60 5th edition browser and starts up with the typical Sony Ericsson homepage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has quite a few shortcomings in usability though. The kinetic scrolling for one - it doesn't have enough momentum and stops way too abruptly. The tap-to-zoom feature switches between three levels of zoom: 30%, 100% and 200%. Strangely, it was a little hard to trigger, so you are better off using the zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a page full screen or bringing up the minimap requires two taps, which is exactly a click more than it should have been. And while the browser has support for multiple pages opened at the same time, this only works for popups - you can't open a new tab manually and punch in a new web address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the page rendering is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed on a desktop PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high resolution is also welcome here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen. There is also a login auto-fill interface that really makes logging online that much easier on a device without a physical keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the web browser has support for both Flash and Java, which means that you can enjoy flash videos straight in your browser without having to use the mobile versions of sites like YouTube. Just bear in mind that it's not Flash 9.4 like on Nokia N900, but Flash Lite instead so exceptions are to be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of speed the browser performs very well but when viewing a YouTube video it would often show a "memory low" warning. The videos still played smoothly though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the second S60 touch-browser is nicely equipped but fails to address some basic usability shortcomings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 organizer didn't get tweaked that much for the new OS beyond basic touch optimization, but this time you will be glad to have Copy/Paste in the menu options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and to-do, which allows you to check up all your pending tasks regardless of their date. There are the same four types of events available for setting up as on S60 3rd edition - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also highly functional with preinstalled viewers for Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. The PDF viewer was preinstalled on our unit but it's only a 15-day trial version again (duh!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, editing documents is not supported on the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to buy the additional license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit though that the calculator is much more comfortable to operate with fingers than with a D-pad, almost as if it was designed for such use from the very beginning. Now let's just hope new non-touchscreen devices get something better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Few applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled applications on the Sony Ericsson Vivaz include RoadSync, SMS Preview and Facebook. There's also dedicated voice-guided navigation software, which we'll cover later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DataViz RoadSync is among the most useful preinstalled applications if you plan to use your Vivaz in a corporate environment. In essence, it's an ActiveSync client, which provides secure, wireless and direct push synchronization of corporate e-mail, calendar, contacts, tasks and attachments. You don't need to be a white-collar worker to use that. You may just as well sync your phone to the Google could service - contacts, email and calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS Preview is a handy tool, which previews incoming SMS messages on the homescreen so you won't even have to unlock the phone to read the message. You can set up how long the preview lasts. To start using SMS Preview though, you have to activate the app, which requires sending a single international SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two apps don't come preinstalled in your phone, but their installation packages are found on your memory card. Both are Symbian native apps. The Water Level is a pretty accurate leveling tool with various options. World Mate is a travel advisor for weather, flights, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Facebook app too, which speaks for itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wisepilot to guide your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is nothing spectacular - it managed to get a lock from a cold start in a couple of minutes but we had to go out into an open area. It wouldn't get a lock on the balcony of our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz is equipped with the Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect in a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead get downloaded interactively over the air. A flat data fee is definitely recommended if you're out and about but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well. It really would have helped avoid roaming data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass, like on most of its competitors, to facilitate navigation. Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two games on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only two games preinstalled and despite the catchy names and looks, they really aren't so cool. The first one is called SSX 3 and is an accelerometer-controlled snow-board racer. There are four virtual buttons too for jumping, strafing, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other game is Rally Masters, with the accelerometer again in charge of steering and just one virtual key for braking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have been limping on profits lately but their ambitions seem to not have suffered one bit. There is the Satio, now the Vivaz and with the XPERIA X10 on its way, the company is gaining a firm foothold in the high-end segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some people scoff at the sight of Symbian but Sony Ericsson's work on the homescreen and their signature media menu, you can spend quite some time using the phone before you actually come down to the slightly off-putting S60 5th UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the display might seem inadequate next to the awe-inspiring HTC HD2. The Vivaz though was built to be compact and screen size was dictated by pocketability, not the other way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface and screen size are pretty much the things for anyone to complain about. The display is sensitive, the CPU is speedy and the camera is excellent - and hard to beat really. So, the phone is great, but this doesn't mean much until you have a good look at the competition as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparisons between the Sony Ericsson Vivaz and the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD are inevitable. Symbian and 720p video make the two the bitterest of rivals. Samsung have had plenty of time to chisel out some of the problems the Omnia HD had at launch - audio quality and framerate issues in videos. The audio they fixed early on by switching to AAC, but video is still struggling to make it to 24 frames per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz has its issues as well, but at least it's capable of delivering all 24 fps - and the HD video recording is quite promising. Sony Ericsson's take on Symbian feels more refined too - the homescreens are simple to use but offer all the basic functionality you need and we always liked the custom media menu - especially in its touch-enabled form. Plus the Vivaz feels zippier than the Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8910 Omnia HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you haven't bought an HDTV yet, then we'll suggest you look at the Sony Ericsson Satio. It won't capture 720p video (just VGA@30fps) but it does 12MP still shots. It offers most of the same functionality as the Vivaz, but on a 3.5" screen. It still lives in a FastPort world though, so finding a good pair of headphones might be a problem.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Vodafone 360 H1 by Samsung will perhaps intrigue the more adventurous among our readers with its OS. It's one of the few phones around with a LiMo OS (an open source mobile phone based on Linux, and no, it's not Android). The hardware of the 360 H1 lists an AMOLED 3.5" capacitive touchscreen with 480x800 pixels resolution, a Cortex A8 600MHz CPU, a 5MP camera, 16GB of internal storage, Wi-Fi and GPS. We haven't had a chance of testing that in person so we can't pass any judgments yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Vodafone 360 H1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For compact touchscreen goodness, the Samsung S8000 Jet is a must-see. The screen is slightly smaller at 3.1" but 480 x 800 pixels make some difference, especially that it's an AMOLED screen. You won't find pixel density like that elsewhere. It's no contest when it comes to the camera though - the Jet has only 5 megapixels and D1@30fps to offer. And while the Jet has SatNav software and a document viewer it doesn't have the flexibility of a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8000 Jet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a stroll around our rumor mill reveals two more potential contenders - the Samsung M8920 with its 3x optical zoom and the HTC Bravo. The quickest way to describe the Samsung M8920 is that it is a 720p-capable 12MP point-and-shoot camera with phone functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Bravo is more orthodox - it's an un-Googled Nexus One with a little bit more perks. It runs Android, has a 3.7" AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, a 1GHz Snapdragon CPU and its 5MP camera is rumored to capture 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung M8920 ? HTC Bravo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's safe to say there is no phone just like the Sony Ericsson Vivaz - the competition is a thing or two short or has a thing or two in its favor. For a bigger screen, you'd have to give up either the smooth video recording or go with an OS that barely ranks in terms of market share. The other option is to wait for phones that haven't even been officially confirmed yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Vivaz design team knew what they wanted right from the start and they have achieved their goal. When the Vivaz hits the stores, there will be a line a mile long of Sony Ericsson fans queing for it but, more importantly, there will probably be quite a few new converts as well.</paragraph>
