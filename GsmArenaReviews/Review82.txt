			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It looks like LG have been playing their own version of will it blend. There's no need to tell you they're not playing for fun - they're rather trying to squeeze some more cash off a couple of hot-selling handsets. So, here's the deal. Get your blender, throw in an LG Arena and a Cookie and set the speed to "budget". And there you have it - an LG GD510 Pop - ready to be served to the happy masses. The "pop" LG are going for is definitely "popular", as opposed to the "popstar stuff" some of you may have hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go ahead and call it the new Cookie, or the low-cost Arena, but the LG Pop is quite obviously keen to have its own purpose and personality. The optional battery cover fitting a solar panel and the all-round eco-friendliness are one way for it to stand on its own two feet as a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from that, the Pop is just another midrange touchscreen. And this is by no means a guilty verdict. The LG Cookie used to be just another touchscreen too. Certainly not now - over 5 million units sold later. The Pop is perhaps setting its hopes high as well. Let's see if the classic unisex design, the feature mix and the affordable price tag can do it for it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's something about the styling of the Pop that might misguide users to expect Arena-like functionality. In fact, the only Arena stuff inside is the S-Class-styled main menu - the rest of the interface is like on the LG Cookie. The important features for the mass user are there but the expected price bracket doesn't really imply high-end specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many people might miss the camera autofocus and 3G support. And yes, some would have been delighted to get Wi-Fi support on the spec sheet. To us, the most important omission - given the potential target audience - is DivX/XviD support. Anyway, the reason for all that is more than clear: specs are sticking to the basics to keep the price tag comfortably low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess, there's no reason to construe the GD510 Pop as an upgrade to the LG KP500 Cookie. The Pop is simply the next LG handset to try and tap on the demand for basic affordable touchscreens. An inevitable response to what Samsung are doing with the Star, the Preston and the Corby. To set it apart from the Cookie, the Pop was given some of the LG Arena styling, an optional solar panel and has taken an altogether greener stance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We praised the Cookie for its handling and style, and the Pop has quite a lot to live up to. The first impression is promising enough though. The Arena-like looks and absolutely minimalist exterior may receive a warm enough reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More on the LG GD510 Pop coming up after the jump. We can safely say the LG Pop looks above its class but let's see how it handles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD510 Pop 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG GD510 Pop stands at 97.8 x 49.5 x 11.2mm and that's probably the most significant difference from the larger Cookie (which is 106.5 x 55.4 x 11.9 mm). The Cookie is commendably compact and palm-friendly but the Pop is (rightfully!) pitched as the smallest 3" touchscreen to date. The Pop's compact appearance and feel will surely be appreciated. By the way, the Pop does look more grownup and business-like too - and that may be another point in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of just 87g is quite nice as well. The compact touchscreen feels secure in the palm without being a burden. The handset is all plastic but by no means plasticky. Single-handed use is very comfortable - the single hardware button up front is a rare design decision, which works well enough most of the time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop is notably smaller than the Cookie but the more important design feature is its obviously the more mature styling. We still think the LG KP500 Cookie was fabulously shaped and built but the Pop may be able to appeal to more diverse age groups. The peculiar pet name is kinda set to prove us wrong but we hope you get the point. The Pop rides on minimalist unisex design and clean lines. There isn't too much gloss and glamor but the handset is compelling enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen form factor is limiting to the choices of styling and the GD510 Pop has chosen a rather unusual way to stand out. It has a single hardware button up front, which serves different purposes depending on context. This is very much in line with the clean minimalist styling of the handset. The asymmetrical placement of the button in the bottom right corner gives the phone a distinct face too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Cookie which is available in several different colors, the Pop only has a black and a silver paintjob (however, this is likely to change). On our silver unit, the front and the sides are very light silver while the back is dark, with faux brushed metal finish. Long story short: the Pop has what it takes to catch your eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3" screen has a thin blue frame and mirror-like finish. The mirror finish might be a plus when it comes to the looks but the sunlight legibility definitely suffers. But you'll find more on the display further down after we're done covering the design and construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the screen there is the earpiece which also serves as a loudspeaker. It turned out quite loud but it unpleasantly distorts music at its highest volume setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen there is a single hardware key, which is in effect a multi-functional home key. It can serve as a Call/End button during calls too and the only limitation is it can't be used to reject an incoming call. Your only option for that is the on-screen slider. The home key has varying backlighting (green or red) to denote its current context purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side of the LG Pop we find the volume rocker, which has metal-like finish and great tactile feedback. All the way down on the left is the standard microUSB port covered by a plastic lid. The port serves for plugging in the data cable, charger and headset connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of GD510 Pop hosts the camera key. We'll hardly surprise you when we say it is multi-functional too. A short press will launch the task switcher/application launcher. Effectively, you're faced with a two-tab menu - the first tab contains shortcuts to favorite apps, the second is the actual task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing and holding that same key will activate the camera. A single control accommodating the shutter key and task switcher is nothing new really - we've seen that solution on a number of Samsung handsets (not that we quite like the Samsung implementation). The LG Pop has no camera autofocus, so it doesn't need a two-step shutter key - taking pictures is a matter of a single press all the way down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG GD510 Pop accommodates the lanyard eyelet as well as the power button, which is also used to lock and unlock the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom on the other hand is quite plain and features only a mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of LG GD510 Pop features the 3 megapixel fixed focus camera lens, which has no flash whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the rear cover reveals the 900 mAh Li-Ion battery. To open the cover you just slide it down as the indicated by the arrow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Updated 02 Dec: The LG GD510 Pop emerged as quite a long-distance runner. The handset lasted some good 7 days on a single charge, which included a total of about 90 minutes of talk time and shooting occasional photos, plus a bit of tinkering with the other phone features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it recently became clear, LG will be also offering an optional solar panel for the LG Pop. The solar panel is said to provide over 2 minutes of talk time or 180 minutes of standby time per every 10 minutes of sunlight exposure, which sound quite efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover we also find the hot-swappable microSD card slot. The phone had no problems handling a reasonably full 16GB microSDHC card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 12 Dec: The build-quality of LG GD510 Pop is flawless. We had case of a wobbly battery cover with our pre-production unit. But since then we received a final testing sample and we're happy to report the build quality is now rock solid much like the LG Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the LG Pop is entirely made of plastic but that doesn't seem to compromised durability or looks. In fact, the handset feels quite a bit more sophisticated than it (supposed) price tag suggests. The hand feel is commendable and operating the device is a breeze.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop has a 3" display which is probably the same unit as that on the LG Cookie. Both devices share screens of identical size and resolution (WQVGA), which is perhaps the standard in the lower midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resistive touchscreen on the LG Pop certainly is no capacitive display and needs a push to accept your commands but it's still nice. Its image quality is excellent too, but only indoors. The letdown - quite predictably - is its sunlight legibility. We have to note though that the LG GD510 Pop's display is above the company average in terms of performance under direct light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also quite a number of settings for the touchscreen feedback. You can choose between gentle vibrations (haptic feedback), or a tone when a click is accepted. You can also turn both off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get to pick the haptics vibration type and intensity, as well as the type and volume of the tones. Finally, you can calibrate your screen to optimize touch control. The only thing missing is an ambient light sensor to adjust the screen brightness to the ambient lighting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A pinch of S-Class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop is the first LG mid-range phone to offer a budget version of the LG S-Class touch interface that's usually reserved for high tier devices. Besides the S-class eye-candy, it also comes with the proprietary Livesquare homescreen plus a handful of social networking apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the core though is still the regular LG Cookie or LG Renoir interface. There's a somewhat livelier camera UI - a bit downgraded variety of the camera UI of LG Viewty Smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in terms of UI, the LG GD510 Pop offers an interesting mix of modern features and looks, while keeping a low profile so as not to interfere with the sales of its elders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface response is generally fast, fluid and responsive enough, and it should satisfy most users. The resistive display is decently sensitive and only needs a slight push.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface features a lot of nice animations and transition effects. For example, when you get to the bottom of a scrolling list, the items don't just stop rolling, but bounce and throb to your sweeps with almost physical elasticity as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first nice novelty that the LG GD510 Pop brings is the three alternating homescreen panes. The first is the Widget-enabled screen that allows you to arrange several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widget tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or stash the ones you don't need back in the tray. The padlock pictogram at the bottom left lets you know when you can use the "shake to auto align" option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets available on the LG Pop are an analog clock, a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a weather widget, notes app, image slideshow, a world clock, a calendar, web search, cellular info, pocket apps and social networking widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two are new to LG homescreens. The Pocket Apps is very nice and useful widget that gets you access to several installed apps - Banner, Weight Tracker, Running Mate, Mellow candle, Mind Selector and Sound Tuner. We'll get to those in detail in the mobile applications chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second new widget is the Social Networking one. It has been upgraded since the LG GW520 and now supports all Facebook, MySpace and Twitter. It is a browser independent app covering all the basics of the trio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, new widgets cannot be added. That is the main disadvantage compared to the competing Samsung TouchWiz interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to align the widgets onscreen by shaking the handset thanks to the built-in accelerometer. For this to work however you need to have the widgets tray opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the second homescreen you sweep your finger sideways across the screen. The screen turns over like you roll a cube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second homescreen doesn't work with widgets, but lets you arrange favorite contact icons instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next is the Livesquare homescreen, which is one of the few notable improvements over the Cookie and we first saw that in the LG GW520. The Livesquare is in essence a log of all your recent communications. They are displayed on the screen with icons for each person you've made contact with - even ones that are not on your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By having them straight on the screen, you can easily call them back without opening the phonebook or the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the background as a Zoo or a Park, populated by small human or animal figures, which will represent your contacts. Livesquare enhances usability but its graphical implementation is really childish. While that was OK on the tween-happy LG GW520, it seems a bit out of place on the more mature LG Pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one other thing about Livesquare, which tends to get on our nerves. Every time you unlock the phone, swap homescreens or land on Livesquare from no matter where, all contacts' icons take their time to refresh (they all disappear and then pop back on the screen one by one). And you have to wait for the phone do that each time - especially when your screen is full of recent contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the content you fill your homescreens with, down at the bottom you will find a navigation bar with four non-negotiable shortcuts. The first one takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contact list, the third one takes you to Messaging, and the last one brings up the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop main menu is identical to the S-Class one (LG Arena, Viewty Smart and Crystal) and is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. The layout is well familiar - instead of using four icons in a vertical column, LG now have opted for a layout of four rows of menu items that are scrollable horizontally. In this way almost all menu items are accessible simultaneously without jumping from tab to tab wondering "Now where was that placed?"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even better, if you turn the phone sideways, the menu items are all displayed with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange the icons from every row by tapping and holding the desirable icon and dragging it where you want it to appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has also been changed and this time we like it much better. Along with the previous "Press &amp; Hold to Unlock" we have "Slide Up to Unlock" too - similar to what we saw on the LG BL40 New Chocolate. You need to press and slide the lockscreen up to reveal the homescreen. Recent events like missed calls, new messages or emails are also displayed on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since the KF700, LG feature phones come equipped with a task manager. The Pop makes no exception with the handy application allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the Pop is pretty similar to the one found on the Renoir and the Cookie&gt; It's complemented by secondary "launcher" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. Unlike the Renoir, the GD510 only offers nine slots since the favorite apps list isn't scrollable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing the Pop shares with the other recent touch phones by LG is the Status screen - touching on any of the icons on the status row on top (next to the clock) opens up a screen with signal, battery and memory stats, and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, music player and Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG GD510 Pop is up to 1000 contacts, each with its full set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with fourteen fields, but once you enter a number or an email address, an additional empty field of the same type becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date as a reminder to the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an option to choose the contact's Livesquare icon so it can't be mistaken with somebody else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contact list is fluid and friendly. In fact, LG have done a great job with scrolling throughout the user interface so it's almost as enjoyable as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those starting with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar, which seems the quicker option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as all together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop handles phone calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues.There is Smart Dialing, and Speed dialing is supported. When you hit a key, which has been assigned, you get hinted of the contact in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may have noticed there is only one hardware button, which can accept or end calls. The only way to reject an incoming call is by using the on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While receiving a call, the single button below the display flashes in green until you accept it and then turns red to allow you to end the call. There is also an option to reject a call with an excuse text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're not taking a call, the contextual Home button opens the Call history. It's pretty standard - there are four tabs for full call history, dialed, received or missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Smart Dial functionality in the dialer pad but it's quite useless as it only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you typed. This just isn't of much use since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they got their names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging department does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop handles SMS, MMS, and email. Much like most other handsets by LG, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the multi-tap alphanumeric keypad, or you can rotate the Pop and go for the virtual landscape QWERTY keyboard. There is touch feedback either way, which certainly assists typing accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the QWERTY keyboard is not much of a treat as the 3" widescreen display simply isn't large enough to comfortably fit all those buttons. As a result, keys are rather small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pop's QWERTY keyboard though, even though crammed, is accurate enough and altogether more friendly than the Cookie's. It seems LG put some effort in it and a stylus is not as badly needed as with the Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it - the LG Pop also has handwriting recognition if that's how you roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG Pop deals with them hassle-free. Setting up an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the username and password fields - the account settings were retrieved automatically. Furthermore, we were prompted to select between POP and IMAP setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum attachment size for both incoming and outgoing mail is 1MB. Still, such limitations are a nuisance in a modern email client and we suspect they're imposed to save network carriers the traffic hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory if you get them with an email. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and previewed directly in the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for marking multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multimedia performance of the LG Pop is a good match for the LG Cookie and Renoir, sometimes even faster. The internal memory of 50MB is an exception - just as it was on the Cookie. But with support for 16GB memory cards no one will actually care about the miserly 50MB of inbuilt storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when you have a memory card inserted, each time you open the file browser it needs to refresh the image thumbnails. Not much of a problem if you have a small picture gallery, but when photos start piling up, it could get annoying. But that's a common issue for all current LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop file manager includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. However, unlike some previous generation LG handsets (and those include even some pretty expensive ones) it has no problem handling user-created folders and the files in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have vastly improved their image gallery with the latest generation of touchscreen phones and now it offers a really nice touch experience. Flipping through images feels natural and fluid and will please even discerning users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check your photos straight in the file manager or you can start the dedicated gallery where larger thumbnails are available. Still, the viewer for single images is one and the same for both methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse images in portrait or landscape mode depending on which gallery you're using. The actual Gallery application is available only in landscape mode, while the file manager is only portrait-oriented. It's quite an unusual decision given the LG Pop is equipped with an accelerometer. Zooming (up to 6x) is generally fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of the lack of accelerometer control while browsing the galleries, everything works just fine when viewing single images. They are rotated automatically as you turn the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GD510 also features the same image editor as the Renoir and Cookie with its wide range of options. First off, you get a creative part that allows finger drawing on images, text typing, clipart watermarking, face morphing, selective colorization, and selective color boosting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have tools for basic image treatment such as rotate, resize and mirror, as well as more advanced photo editing options such as levels, brightness, contrast, color, hue and saturation, sharpness, blur. Red-eye removal is also available. And finally, you can add color effects such as black &amp; white, sepia, negative, glow, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the rich features of the editor, we think it scores low on usability. The different options are inconsistently spread across various menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player is good enough</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop has a really nice music player and if you wonder what nice really means, we guess better than the Renoir pretty much says it all. The layout is intact and the looks aren't too different but some nice functionality has been added. In fact you will get the same updated music player in the LG Prada 2. Now, LG could've put the S-Class music player, but we are still happy with this one too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nice Album Art visualization and lots of equalizer presets, which LG touch phones (save for the S-Class line) used to not have up until the Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG Pop music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. There's also a track rating system, which should help with track sorting as well. User-created playlists are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background. You can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated mini player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player is a letdown, no surprise</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now this is the one part where the modest Pop is no match for the Renoir. Due to the lack of DivX and XviD support, videos are less of treat compared to the cameraphone flagship of the house. There is also YouTube integration, offering direct video uploads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can run in both portrait and landscape mode. Alternating the two modes is as easy as flipping the phone to its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to take screenshots of a running video and there is also a built-in video editor that can do a number of modifications on the source video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM radio has RDS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when you minimize the FM radio you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>That's a nice camera you have there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop sports a 3 megapixel fixed focus snapper with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It has no flash of any kind, so night photography is not really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the camera lens in the very top corner at the back is somewhat unpractical since your support finger often gets in the way when shooting. But with a handset this slim taking a photo with one hand is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop camera interface is a combination between S-Class and the old LG UI. You can access all camera settings via the left column bar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for zooming, exposure, shooting mode (single/multiple), full screen/full image plus an advanced settings key. This left toolbar auto hides when not used and you need to tap on the screen to bring it back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the LG Pop screen is another bar with a virtual shutter key, that also slides up and down to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside are the exit and gallery buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This toolbar is fixed and is actually not part of the viewfinder - that's the way to get around the difference between the wide aspect ratio of the screen and the standard 4:3 aspect image sensor. If you don't like that you can opt for the full screen view, where a part of the image does get cropped but you see the center bit in more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop image quality is one of the best parts about the camera. Now, since there is no autofocus, we are obviously not talking closeups here but the rest of the photos turn out pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images produced by the LG Pop have more than enough detail and noise levels are easily tolerable. There is no over sharpening either. The colors are vibrant and accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only noticeable problem with the image processing routine is poor representation of the foliage, but it's something we can live with. The camera did exceed our expectations anyway. Check out the camera samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG GD510 Pop. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the handset captures video in up to QVGA resolution at 15 fps. With enough handsets around shooting WVGA@30fps this is hardly a commendable achievement by today's standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it, the video recording is only good for MMS purposes, so we won't be publishing a video sample from this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is hardly up to speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been a surprisingly good overall performance so far but we knew all along the inevitable compromises to keep the Pop's price tag low would eventually shine through. Its connectivity package has none of the high speed wireless data transfer carriers - 3G and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It still packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and the other connectivity options include Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and USB v2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four available USB connection modes on the LG Pop including Mass Storage, which makes both the internal memory and memory card appear as removable drives on your PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also receive calls when connected in this mode but an incoming call interrupts the connection to the internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is relatively ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop has a generally nice web browser, with good touch response and a decent amount of features. Zooming and scrolling is fast enough and you can drag pages around with your finger much like you would on every other touch-enabled device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse web pages with or without the controls visible. A tap on the screen brings back the controls. Zooming in and out is quite intuitive too - a press and hold on a section of a web page will zoom in so it fits on the screen from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the screen landscape is automatic thanks top the built-in accelerometer and it makes browsing even more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also search web pages for specific text strings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the recent LG touch phones, the web browser history is quite conveniently displayed as a line of webpage screenshots - you can flip through them and just pick the one you want to open again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. You can however go for the streaming mobile version of YouTube at m.youtube.com.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is dully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG GD510 Pop has a decent set of time-management applications. It's obviously not pitched at business people and its target audience should be quite happy with the features offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, offering monthly, weekly and daily view modes and decently finger-optimized browsing. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default (options are Monday or Sunday). You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding one of the three category events (appointment, anniversary, birthday) is as simple as it gets. The LG GD510 Pop can store up to 500 calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a separate To-Do application and it also has room for up to 500 tasks. A Memo feature allows storing some notes (up to 100). Another organizing app is the Date Finder, which can instantly tell you what day of the week any given date will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can backup your calendar events and to-do's on the memory card and restore them later on if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 alarm slots available. Each of them can have its own title, trigger time and repeat pattern (snooze time can also be customized), as well as tone and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing applications on the Pop are calculator, unit converter, stopwatch, world clock and voice recorder.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Getting to the applications is easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD510 Pop also offers office document viewing. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS and PDF files. The phone couldn't handle PowerPoint files however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling and zooming in documents is very fast and fluid, except on extremely close zoom levels. This seems to be the case with most LG handsets in fact but we don't think it's that important. No one actually needs to zoom in that close. Text searching is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even view your documents in landscape mode. However the viewer doesn't switch to it automatically when you tilt the handset. Instead you have to press the onscreen virtual key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In most cases reading your documents in this mode is much more comfortable and natural. The LG Pop doesn't have support for editing documents but let's be honest - no one actually expected it to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a drawing app where you can draw and save your art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Banner app offers various layouts to display some text on the screen and can be used as a screensaver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weight Tracker and Running Mate are meant to help you watch your weight and get exercise, calculating some useful numbers as allowed fats, BMI, speed of your runs, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mellow Candle and Mind Selector are nothing but pastime gimmicks. Mellow Candle give you a selection of candels, which you can blow off by physically blowing into the phone's microphone. Mind Selector on the other hand is like the a virtual coin flipping - you can check a random Yes/No answer to your ideas or dilemmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sound Tuner gives you a collection of ambient sounds featuring twenty different sounds - from natural to urban.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bunch of games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite in line with its market positioning, the LG GD510 Pop comes with a bunch of preinstalled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the two accelerometer based titles. While not exactly games they are a nice way to demonstrate the sensitivity and precision of the built-in sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one, Flying Dice, lets you roll a pair of dice by shaking the handset. The Flying Dice also offers a set of really simple mini games, including a drinking game. Maybe this is the right handset to get a party off the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Golf Slope is a golf simulator using the accelerometer. We're not sure it will really enhance your golfing ability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's the Music World game where you have to tap some jumping yellow creatures in the right moment in order to reveal some puzzle picture. Thomsons and Touch is a set of six mini touch-controlled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have the well familiar Brain Challenge 2 and Diamond Twister, but they are just demo versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are free to install other games of your choice without worrying about the unconventional resolution - titles for QVGA screens run just as fine on the Pop, taking only the upper two thirds of the screen. The unused space is occupied by virtual controls that make up for the lack of a D-pad and context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are apps like Opera Mini that don't need the virtual controls as they're enabled for touch operation, while others will depend on the virtual on-screen controls for all navigation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Pop seems a reasonable move given the generous return of investment by the Cookie. We still think the Cookie is very hard to beat but the LG GD510 Pop may have taken the right approach. It's striving to repeat a huge success and uses the same concept but does well to distinguish itself. The Pop is just a bit more conservative - but equally appealing - and that may secure it more diverse demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's true though that the LG Pop hardly outdoes the Cookie in terms of features save for a few little S-Class touches to its interface. Comparisons will be inevitable and the LG Pop may find it hard to motivate as many users. It seems 3G and WLAN are too much to ask in the kind of market the Pop is aiming at, but DivX support could've made a lot of sense for the target audience. LG chose to go green instead but it's not certain that the optional solar panel will make that much difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we have to admit the Pop is facing a much harder task than the Cookie. And we're not talking pure sales. The Cookie was pretty much unchallenged in its day - free to take on the more or less empty niche of basic touchscreens. The Pop in turn has to strike a difficult balance. It could've easily been expected to match the Cookie track record if it offered a couple of upgrades but it would've stood right in the way of higher-ranked devices like the Arena. In the end, it follows the Cookie recipe almost literally, so let's see how that works on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today basic touchscreen phones are all over the place. There are still enough high-end gadgets that cost a fortune but the first icebreakers like the LG Cookie and the Samsung Star really made touch available to the masses. Keeping an eye on Samsung is actually very important for LG and the Pop is their response to the growing Samsung presence in that segment.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A couple of other Samsung alternatives are the still hot S3650 Corby and the old but gold F480 Tocco, which is getting cheaper as it grows older. The Corby has just been released and specifically targets youth with a basic feature set and lively paintjobs. On the opposite site, the F480 Tocco may cost 30 euro more, but it's easily a fashion statement on its own and it's got an excellent camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia offerings in the same class are an important indicator of how much the market has evolved since the Cookie. We're talking serious smartphone competition. The Symbian S60 based 5530 XpressMusic offers a higher-res screen plus Wi-Fi, while the Nokia 5230 swaps Wi-Fi for 3G connectivity and a GPS receiver.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, the Pop is a neat little gadget that's keen to build on the Cookie success. It does follow the Cookie concept closely but tries to write its own story. The good thing is the Pop has a distinct feel and in the same time manages to match the easy-going friendly attitude that did wonders for the Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad? well, the Pop doesn't really offer anything much over the Cookie except some visual upgrades. But the Cookie will eventually start to phase out. So, if the Pop is supposed to come off the bench and keep up the pace, it may as well do a good enough job for LG. And it will sure do a great job for users who want a neat and friendly touchscreen that looks better than its price tag.</paragraph>
