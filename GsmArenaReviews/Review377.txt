			<paragraph>There is no doubt that both the small size and the competitive price of the communicator HP iPaq rw6815 will make you fall in love with it. The device is powered by a powerful 416MHz processor, it runs under Windows Mobile 2005 OS, and has a high-quality touchscreen display and numerous multimedia features. But as usual, a few mishaps here and there are inevitable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After a relatively long break Hewlett Packard is coming back with new communicators based on the Windows Mobile 2005 OS. First HP launched the successful hw6915 model with a hardware keypad. Now it presents the communicator rw6815 Personal Messenger, whose strengths are rather different. Let us mention right at the beginning that we are having the honor to test one of the smallest communicators ever designed in the history of mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do not hide that HP pocket computers are among our most favorite ones since their first PDA - iPaq h3760 was launched. At those times manufactures used to pay increased attention to the quality of the body construction with a strong accent on design exclusivity. With time competition got stronger, as a result of which price ? as a crucial market factor - has overrun both looks and software equipment. Let?s, however, get a closer look into HP iPaq rw6815 step by step.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A whipper-snapper you will love<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It often happens that communicators and devices of the PDA category tend to look far smaller on pictures than they are in reality. The case of iPaq is just the opposite. When we opened the retail package its small size provoked a sigh of astonishment. We ran to compare it to Qtek S100 (MDA Compact). And in fact, iPaq is 6 mm shorter than the S100. On the other hand, however, the S100 is 1.5 mm thinner. Should HP had left iPaq ?on a more serious diet?, today we would have held an unbeatable communicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first element to catch the eye is the smoked plastic cover protecting the display. At the very beginning, working with the first HP PDA models, we used to look upon this type of protection with significant mistrust. It has proved very useful and comfortable with time, though. Thanks to it one doesn?t need to use the protecting case enclosed in the retail package, when having the communicator in their pocket, for example. The display cover opens upwards. Unfortunately, when opened it closes the access to the stylus as well as to the Switch On button making the switch-on process rather difficult. So be sure to keep one and the same strict opening method: pull out the stylus, switch on the communicator, and open up the protecting cover. The cover is easy to remove. Without it iPaq becomes by few millimeters thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP iPaq rw6815 is dressed up in glossy and matt silver. Even if usually a successful combination, in this case it seems somewhat misbalanced. The glossy silver-imitating chromium looks a little bit cheap. A pity indeed as HP has demonstrated a great capacity of elaborating good designs in both its older and recent models. HP iPaq rw6815 is all made of plastic materials. Metal has been out of use for some time already. What is praiseworthy is iPaq?s construction: all its parts stick perfectly; no creaks are heard at all. Holding it in your hand is extremely comfortable due to its rounded edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the most interesting elements on iPaq?s body: a standard four-way control key with a confirming center is located beneath the display; around it there are four other keys ? two soft ones and two receivers ones. Next you will see two expressed silver grills protecting two speakers, whose volume levels is medium rather than superb; yet, it is fully sufficient for voice control or video playback. Above the display there is a long transparent strip covering a speaker and two service LEDs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MiniUSB highly welcome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s now take a closer look at the very details iPaq has to offer. In its bottom you will find a standard miniUSB connector ? great news indeed as it means that HP has abandoned the special connector that used to limit user?s work significantly. The advantages of the miniUSB connector are numerous: you will not need to buy expensive proprietary data cables, for example; what?s more, it is a standard element of every modern PC. A 2.5 mm audio jack connector is located right next to the synchronizing port. Of course, a light handsfree set with a four-contact jack is in the retail package content. A common adapter for plugging in your own earphones can be used too. Rather disappointing is the sound quality of the audio output. We would not complain if it was for the noise at every switch between songs. The problem is that iPaq creates a noise as strong as no other device that we?ve tested. If it is rock, metal, house or pop you listen to, the noise might kind of disperse in it. As far as classical or chill out compositions or any other type of ?clear music? are concerned, you?d forget about them straight away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera and the voice recorder buttons are located on the right side of the communicator. Their functions could be changed from the setup menu; here you will also find one specialty: the menu for modification of key functions offers the possibility to re-program the voice control key, which is missing, however. In fact, it is ?simulated? by a long press on the key for reducing the volume of the earphone. The top right corner is occupied by a stylus divided into two parts of different surface each, just like the entire pocket computer, by the way. The top half is shiny, while the center is matt. The stylus holds firmly in its bed; its extraction requires a bit of effort and even an use of a nail. Just next to the stylus you will see the communicator?s switch-on button. The memory card slot (miniSD type) is asymmetrically located a little bit further on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device does not feature anything but two volume control keys. The rear side is far more interesting: here you will find a 2 megapixel camera plus two highly powerful LEDs, and a tiny glossy area for self-portraits. Encrusted on the back is a scored-out dustbin , which inevitably evokes an ironic smile. Was it really so difficult to hide it on the inside part of the plastic cover?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A display with few defects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The size of the display respects the size of the entire device. Technically it is a standard display with resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, able to display 65K colors. The small size of the display has impact on certain activities, like auto navigation for example. The font size is user configurable; nonetheless, the tiny virtual keypad seems as if on the edge of usability. The intensity levels of the display backlighting are superb. Its highest level is extremely comfortable on sunny days, while its lowest one becomes relevant at night, when backlighting gets as strong as to provide perfect legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display suffers from a minor defect: when touched with the stylus, both its left and right edges get waved on and change their color. It is pretty similar to a touch on a LCD display, but it?s not a tragedy. Perhaps you would have not even noticed it if we had not brought it to your attention.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OS and control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HP iPaq rw6815 features the operational system Windows Mobile 5 with AKU 2.0 update pack. Some of the most significant novelties here are Direct Push (detailed further on) and the new Bluetooth with the A2DP profile, which allows you to listen to music through wireless stereo earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few comments regarding the operational system for beginners. Those acquainted with Windows Mobile can skip this paragraph. We often run into the opinion that the Windows Mobile OS should logically be identical to Windows for PCs, thus new users should effortlessly get used to its interface and control modes. Unfortunately, the only common part in both systems is their Start menu; everything else is rather different. Of course, multitasking is part of Windows Mobile, but you will not find a bar with running applications, for example. If you want to switch between two running applications, you need first to select the one that is to be open in the menu, just as if you are to run it all over again. The icon in the top right corner changes between the ?x? and the OK keys according to the corresponding application. And finally, a click on the ?x? key does not close the respective application, but only minimizes it. To terminate an application you have to use the following options: start-settings-system-memory-running application. Windows Mobile should have been designed in such a way that it remains fast and stable without having to close running applications. Those of you with longer experience with this OS, however, will surely agree with us that it does not always work this way, especially in the case of more complicated applications and in terms of available memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For no beginner will Windows Mobile look user-friendly, at least not at the very beginning. Fortunately, there are plenty of applications facilitating the work with active processes. They enable for fast shifts between applications, their termination, etc. In other words, they provide the assistance the operational system does not, even though it should have been able to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Control is somewhat inconvenient and slow. The high amount of negative remarks in this respect in the past has made the manufacturer implement a few improvements in the last version Windows Mobile 5. Yet, the result could hardly be satisfying if the communicator manufacturer does not participate in the innovation, and it is sad to say, but in the case of rw6815 HP has not participated at all. On one hand, iPaq rw6815 is a communicator managed through a stylus, and we appreciate this. On the other hand, however, it is also a mobile phone, and as such it should have been able to provide users with quick and easy single-hand dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that the most crucial defect of iPaq rw6815 is the absence of control keys beneath the display, and particularly the one opening the Start menu and the OK/Close one. Instead, the Start menu is opened through a longer press on the green receiver (fixed, non user-configurable option), while OK/Close function has been fully forgotten. Also pay attention to the fact that it is not the center of the control button, but the Enter key that fulfills the OK/Close functions. In practice this means that once having selected an option, you will not be able to confirm it, unless you use the stylus or by aiming a miniature point on the display. Besides, the display is surrounded by quite a high frame, in a result of which its edges are difficult to reach by a thumb. Bear in mind that the two software keys beneath the display are NOT user-configurable. After having tested Palm Treo 650 we had the pleasure to also work with Treo 680, whose hardware keys are an example of control brilliancy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, it is mainly Microsoft and its OS Windows Mobile to blame for the user-unfriendly control of iPaq rw6815, but there is no doubt that Hewlett Packard has also played its role and is therefore responsible for the result.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Both mistakes and attractive features in the calling applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPaq rw6815 features a built-in standard GSM communication module, but does not support UMTS (3G). The communicator states no limits to the number of saved contacts. The amount of fields assigned to each contact is enough to meet any user?s needs. Contacts together with details inside them are seamlessly synchronized with MS Outlook ? a simple way to always have updated back-up in your PC. Remote synchronization with an Exchange server is available as long as the latter supports such type of synchronization. In the case of MacOS X we highly recommend you the application Missing Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once we had packed up the communicator with contacts, the next stage of our testing was to start calling. Here we ran into another control obstacle: HP had forgotten to install a "smart dialer" (not a single one), which is a standard part of the equipment of all HTC PocketPCs. It is not only Microsoft to blame, who failed to implement it directly into the OS, but also Hewlett Packard, who could have added this application for easier dialing to the communicator?s features, just like HTC did. Let?s explain the problem: when you switch on the device and press the green receiver, a virtual keypad with numbers and letters appears on the display. The selection of a letter does not lead to a name filtering though ? you need to insert a phone number. What? Oh yes, that?s right! Microsoft seems absolutely convinced in users? ability to memorize 500 phone numbers. But there is a Contacts key, you will oppose. Yes, but if you do not want to pull out the stylus, you get no other remedy but browse the entire phonebook using the down arrow, really slow. A longer press on the arrow activates letter browsing, but even so searching may take you as long as half a minute. Without a doubt, the stylus makes things much easier, but who?s so crazy to feel like pulling it out every time a call is to be made?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called "Smart Dialer" works as expected: you need to tap on the letter keys on the virtual keypad to filter the corresponding contacts. Besides, you can use the fastest and unbeatable search through T9; a single tap on a selected virtual key is enough to run the process - brilliant, fast and simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPaq rw6815?s speaker is loud enough even though some reviewers express the opposite opinion. The testing piece we were provided with performed superbly in 100% noisy environment like a city street or inside a tram. Yet, our total evaluation mark is not the highest as the sound is unnatural, with less dynamics than desired. The speaker performs middle and high tonalities the best. The opposite part did not have any remarks on the sound quality. We also connected iPaq with a wireless Nokia earphone and it worked seamlessly. You will simply have to get accustomed to the time lag after accepting a call typical for all communicators based on the Windows Mobile platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last con that should not remain unmentioned refers to the keys beneath the display, which do not get illuminated when a call is coming. It would have been far more comfortable if they did, even though calls can be accepted by both the soft-key and the receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application serving calls is Voice Command. It dials calls and runs applications without the necessity of prior instruction records. Voice Command pronounces the name of the caller, provided the latter is saved in the communicator memory. If it is stored on the SIM card, the application only pronounces the corresponding number. What a pity that voice commands do not get transferred to the wireless Bluetooth earphone. It would have been the one and only truly practical implementation of this application.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile data transfers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The voice type of communication is among the most important. Devices like HP iPAQ rw6815, however, are generally sought after by users in need of data communication. iPaq features GPRS/EDGE, but lacks HSDPA and even UMTS. Nevertheless, EDGE should be sufficient for any kind of comfortable browsing of graphic web pages. What?s more, EDGE is supported by nearly all existing operators. If you want to make a full use of data transfers, you?d better subscribe for a special data tariff. Should you not, you may want to install a suitable application to count up the amount of transferred data as well as the expected cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile data transfers provide access to a whole range of useful services, of which the most crucial is email communication. Windows Mobile offers the application Inbox supporting POP3 accounts. Inbox manages multiple accounts, provides automatic check in regular time intervals, signatures, and fully supports work with attachments. Besides, the upgrading pack AKU 2.0 comes to offer the so called Direct Push technology, also implemented in the famous Blackberry communicators. Email box is generally checked in regular time intervals. Thanks to Direct Push, however, emails are delivered immediately after having been received by the server. The only but also neccessary condition is that your company?s Exchange server supports Direct Push. Also keep in mind the amount of spam in today?s electronic flows, which will inevitable raise your monthly expenses and will eat up a part of the battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a brief summary of some other uses of data functions: Internet Explorer (standard application) provides access to common Internet pages, but experiences difficulties with certain types of scripts or opening pages in separate windows etc. Should you have problems with browsing common web sites, look for alternative solutions. Many users ask about the compatibility between iPaq rw6815 and the service Web'n'walk from T-Mobile. They can work together, but you should use Opera Mini instead of a common Internet browser. Windows Mobile does not permit direct start of Java applications, but iPaq has a solution for this problem: in its menu you will find an application, which can install and run any type of Java applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter what type of on-line communication you happen to work with - MSN, ICQ, AIM, IRC, Jabber or Yahoo, you will easily find the corresponding application on Internet for free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IrDA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPaq offers the classical combination of wireless technologies Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and IrDA. The Infrared port is located on the right side of the communicator. Even if already an old communicational interface, in iPaq it still comes in handy when data transfers are made. We recommend you to deactivate the Infrared port in the Beam menu. It is also here where you can activate it back, if necessary. This relative discomfort is worth as it saves energy for your communicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, they are not presented in iPaq in their best known versions. For example, Bluetooth 1.2 transfer speed is lower than the one of 2.0. On the other hand, the improvements in 1.2 in comparison to 1.1 are more significant. Besides, Bluetooth 1.2 may result to be fully sufficient, unless you transfer big amount of data. To our surprise, Bluetooth works through a Microsoft interface. It is a pity, indeed; we were used to the brilliant Broadcomm manager offered by HP in previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPaq works seamlessly with both a wireless earphone and a GPS receiver communicating via a virtual serial port. Synchronization with the program Missing Sync in MacOS X worked out at the first try. Surprisingly, synchronization via Bluetooth in Windows XP SP2 and ActiveSync was not as difficult to make as we had expected. What iPaq did not manage was file transferring. To verify that it was not MacOS X to blame we tried out transfers between two communicators (with Qtek S100) as well as with a common PC on Windows and Bluetooth USB ? all in vain. Anyway, the entire problem might simply be a defect in the communicator we have tested, as other reviewers mention that files are transferred seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi connectivity is not one of the best one could have nowadays, either. It runs at the standard 802.11b, that is, at a maximum transferring speed of 11 Mbit/s. The absence of a faster Wi-Fi technology in iPaq hw6815 is not so crucial, though. Neither surfing the Internet, nor VoIP communication via Skype requires higher transfer speeds. Wi-Fi works without problems. In the application Wi-Fi Utility you can set up the output of the wireless card, which consequently has impact onto the signal cover. iPaq hw6815 is not able to achieve the speed or the level of its competitors, but ? as we already mentioned ? this con is not crucial for the overall functionality of the device. If you are at home, iPaq hw6815 will communicate with any device behind up to four walls. Outside the communicator sends signal to up to hundreds of meters. The Wi-Fi reach in devices like iPaq hw6815 is more or less identical to the one in notebooks with integrated card or PCMCIA Wi-Fi card. Bear in mind, however, that Wi-Fi is able to use up the entire battery of the communicator within a couple of hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS typing for experienced only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the previous paragraphs show, the serious drawback of iPaq hw6815 lies in certain insufficiencies of its practical functions ? a problem not so small as iPaq has no hardware keypad like HTC Wizard or its forerunner iPaq hw6815 for example. Its only option is its touchscreen display and the four modes of text insertion mentioned earlier: a virtual QWERTY mini keypad and three different fonts written with the stylus. We do not mean that these four modes are bad (both typing on the virtual keypad and decoding of written characters are fast, should you have the patience to get used to them); they simply feature a common limitation, that is, they require a stylus, two hands, and most of all ? standing still. If you like typing SMS while walking or in the means of public transport, you will not have success with iPaq hw6815 due to the lack of a real keypad (one like in Qtek S100). Some readers may find typing on virtual keys weird, but we assure you that it is both as comfortable and fast as on a standard mobile phone. It simply requires more tries and patience. If you want, you can additionally install a virtual keypad in iPaq hw6815, but - as we already wrote once ? it should have been done by Microsoft and HP respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all other aspects, SMS typing is rather standard. Message length is virtually unlimited as well as the memory available for received and sent messages. Inside the multimedia editor you will find the useful option to create multi-page messages containing more than one melody, image or text. The only limit in this aspect comes from the mobile operator you work with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the flood of 200 MHz processors from Texas Instruments mainly installed in HTC communicators, iPaq hw6815 brings along the classical Intel xScale PXA 270 working at 416 MHz. It is not possible to make this processor slow down or speed up; it runs in a preset mode and adjust the frequency automatically. It is fast enough. For example, it managed the application iGo without any delays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video tests came out as expected. As we saw in previous communicators and pocket computers, the 400-processor from Intel meets no difficulties in running videos in a resolution of 640 x 352 pixels, with a bitrate above 8000kbps, and accompanied by a stereo sound at 128 kbps. In other words, you can play entire full-screen movies without the need of conversion into lower resolution or lower data type ? unaffordable comfort in the case of Texas Instruments OMAP850 200 MHz. To be precise, there were few cutouts in the picture during the playing, which made it clear that an entire film will hardly ever fit into the internal memory the device. On the other hand, it is also possible that the memory card in the testing piece is defective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are uncertain about which communicator to choose ? HP or HTC, the ?speed? element might be decisive. The processor from Texas Instruments is not slow, but it does not reach the performance of Intel. The iPaq hw6815 processor comes with ROM with a capacity officially stated at 128 MB; if you take a closer look at the memory details, you will find out that 116 MB out of the overall 128 MB are for your personal use! The hint lies in the fact that ROM usually stores the respective OS as well. Most devices with 128 MB ROM offer users about 70 MB. Here, there are two options: either the OS in iPaq hw6815 has the mere 10 MB, or the manufacturer has integrated additional memory especially for the operational system. Since Hewlett Packard has failed to praise itself for having implemented this extra user memory, let us do it instead. Although most users get themselves an additional memory card, system applications seem to ?feel more comfortable? in the memory of the communicator. Running applications use RAM of 64 MB (less than 52 MB available in reality, of which only 30 MB remain once the communicator has been restarted).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPaq hw6815 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera; fixed focus. Hewlett Packard has also forgotten to install a LED for dark environment. The weather was not favorable during the tests, which was a great disadvantage for us as it is exactly the weather and the quantity of light image quality fully depends on. The maximum resolution, in which the communicator makes photos, is 1600 x 1200 pixels, but, of course, lower resolutions are available as well. The camera also features a digital zoom, which only creates crops. In a result, a full zooming-in leads to useless images of mere 160 x 120 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface requires shooting in landscape mode. Both the key on the right side and the control center can be used as a release button. All important options appear on the display and can be controlled by a finger or through the ways of the navigation button. The landscape shooting results into modifications of the zoom-in in vertical direction and into brightness corrections in horizontal direction. Should you need other options, enter the menu, where the use of the stylus becomes inevitable. Inside the menu you will find all common options and a few extra ones: white balance, color effects, three-level compression, resolution and color saturation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to assign GPS details to the EXIF info attached to each photo is of a special interest. Since iPaq does not feature an integrated GPS receiver, you need to plug in an external one. The search we did with our GPS receiver worked seamlessly. Geotagged images from all over the world are available on the following web page - www.flicker.com/map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sample images: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>              </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality highly depends on light conditions. Unfortunately, during the tests the sun hid itself behind the clouds so we could not manage to get the best of iPaq hw6815?s camera. Nonetheless, the above images are pretty sharp, except for the very margins. Those taken inside are characterized by intensified sensitivity and higher noise levels respectively. A bit of a help comes from two powerful LEDs, whose drawback, however, is that they only work at a distance of about two meters. There is a certain time lag between the press on the release button and the shot so do not lose time trying to capture moving objects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HP Photosmart Mobile inside the program menu deserves a special attention. It is an application for simple image modification, prints, and audio notes. It is able to show a non-sophisticated histogram, but does not adjust brightness, contrast or image resolution. HP Photosmart Mobile also features a screensaver, which is activated when the communicator is being charged. It also slideshows photos with the help of a simple animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The communicator also features a few extra applications to the operational system: Today panel Lite shows several icons in the Today menu, Auto Configurator helps set up data services, Wi-Fi Utility and the famous Self Test control the entire device. In the retail package together with iPaq hw6815 you will also get a bonus, with which you can choose your preferred software.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accessories and durability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the communicators the retail package contains a protecting case with a hole for the connector for a light handsfree set. The case is made of solid textile material; it is closed with the help of a magnetic clip. The charger design is especially elegant: its adapter comes with several different types of terminals to be used with different types of sockets in various world countries. Also available is a synchronizing cable, which gets connected to the adapter through a standard USB connector. A wire less in the bag...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The communicator works with a Li-Ion battery of the respectable capacity of 1530 mAh. Used in a common way (making a couple of calls, sending a few messages, transferring data occasionally), you may come to charge iPaq hw6815 every second day. If you, however, work with Wi-Fi intensively or play full-length pictures, the battery life will shrink to three to five hours. Charging via USB during synchronization is available as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good job with few cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPaq rw6815 Personal Messenger should not fear any competitor. There will sure be plenty of candidate owners for its small size, good processor, and highly attractive wireless technologies. And they will not regret the purchase. Nevertheless, iPaq could have come out even better. The problem is not at all in the absence of a built-in GPS receiver, a FM radio or a newer Wi-Fi version. It is about the uncomfortable one-hand control of the entire device ? a practical inconvenience, which - as evident in other communicators ? could have been successfully overcome.</paragraph>
