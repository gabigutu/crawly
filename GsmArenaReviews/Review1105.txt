			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Long gone are the glory days of the Desire line - once a cradle of flagships, it now gives in to the rise of the One series. With the Wildfires all but extinguished, the Desires got the lower midrange all to themselves. But instead of clinging to a glorious past, they're now trusted to start winning over the next generation of smartphone users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The market is ripe for dual-SIM droids, and all the major manufacturers are taking note. Dual-SIMs have helped plenty of people optimize costs and make sense too as a stepping stone for anyone willing to move on from dumbphones. No wonder then, HTC are trying to tap into a niche that's just about started growing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether the HTC Desire V is welcome in this niche is a completely different matter - competition has never been tougher. And we don't just mean the swarms of dual-SIM droids by manufacturers nobody has heard of. The big players in Samsung, LG, Motorola and Sony want a piece too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V is based on the Qualcomm MSM7227A chipset and powered by a 1GHz Cortex-A5 processor and Adreno 200 graphic core. That's a pretty standard configuration in the lower midrange. Dual-SIM support is of course the key feature but with a 4" WVGA screen, Sense UI and a 5MP camera, the Desire V is more than just a starter package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely the Desire V is far from the best spec'd smartphone you can get for the price, but it is easily among the more attractive dual-SIM droids on offer. Raw power and the latest in connectivity are typically not the target audience's top priority. But we're sure Android ICS with Sense 4.0 will be widely appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's too early though to make judgments. We'll get to that but not before we've seen the HTC Desire V in action. Our usual hardware check-up is coming up right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Desire V<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V retail package is a pretty standard affair - you get a charger, a USB cable and a basic headset. The Beats Audio label at the back refers to software enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no memory card included, but you could say HTC already covered that with the 4 gigs of internal storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire V 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V has almost the same measurements as the original Desire, it's just a tad thinner. At 118.5 x 62.3 x 9.3 mm, the Desire V will easily slip into pockets and allow comfortable single-handed use. Entirely made of plastic, it weighs 114 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the HTC Desire V looks much like the Desire C we met with a while ago. The styling is simple and to-the-point. The most notable difference is height - the dual-SIM Desire V is taller in order to accommodate the bigger 4" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find a small earpiece. The proximity and ambient light sensors are well hidden in the screen bezel nearby. Unfortunately the Desire V omits a front-facing camera and a status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the usual layout of Back, Home and Task Switcher capacitive keys. Their icons are painted white and light up with a tap on the screen. They offer haptic feedback too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side accommodates the microUSB port for charging and computer connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right we find the long and thin volume rocker. You can take screenshots by holding the Volume down and Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top and a power/lock button. The latter is centrally placed right above the earpiece and the unusual position may be something to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the device features only the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of the Desire V has a rubbery feel to it and is virtually fingerprint-proof. It feels nice to touch and offers excellent grip. The 5MP auto-focus camera lens and the single LED flash share a finely grooved metal plate in the top left corner. It's the only thing that spoils the overall impression, being completely at odds with the surrounding surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the HTC logo is the loudspeaker grille, with the Beats Audio logo at the very bottom. The battery cover is somewhat hard to remove, but the upside is it fits firmly in place and gives the handset its solid feel. The two SIM compartments are unobstructed by the battery and the micro SD slot is hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Desire V through our battery test and found it to be quite good. It can last over 45 hours on a single charge. If you decide to drain the battery with calls only, it will take you 8 hours and 20 minutes (on a 3G network). Doing the same with web browsing takes 5 hours and 44 minutes or you can watch 6 hours and 26 minutes of video. You can learn more about our testing procedure over here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V packs a 4" LCD display of WVGA resolution (480x800), which is more, in terms of both size and resolution, than you get with the Desire C. The image quality is average at best, but quite decent for the class - the viewing angles are OK, but sunlight legibility could've been better. The native contrast of the screen is actually quite good, but the glass is quite reflective, which damages the image quality in anything but complete darkness..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the HTC Desire V through our usual display tests and here's how it scored. You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire V is built to a high standard and, despite the all plastic body, it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There's no premium finish but the excellent grip and comfortable handling make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that feels out of place is the huge camera plate at the back. If you can live with that, you'll find the Desire V a pleasure to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That about wraps it up on the outside, Ice Cream Sandwich and Sense UI are coming up right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android ICS with the latest Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V comes with Android 4.0.3 and Sense 4.0. In spite of not being the latest Android release, it still comes as quite an achievement, considering the majority of its competitors are still stuck with Gingerbread. We've seen this particular combo of ICS and Sense several times already on the HTC One series phones, but it's still interesting to see it perform on a much more affordable device like the Desire V.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the UI in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is trimmed down just like it was on the HTC One V - this time around, it isn't just the small screen but the less processing power too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, what's missing compared to the One X and the One S is Leap View. The Recent Apps interface is the vanilla ICS layout and the lockscreen cannot be customized: you cannot assign custom app shortcuts - you get Phone, Mail, Messages and Camera, and that's nonnegotiable. There are no different lockscreen types to select from either - the only option the Desire V gives you is the ability to show or hide the default four app shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is quite efficient. There are the usual four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You can either drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone, or any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of homescreens is locked at five - like on the One V, you cannot add or remove any. There is no leap view either. You get an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a brand new dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense offers one of the most full-featured customization suites around. The proprietary Scenes interface lets you choose from various custom homescreen setups, which provide new wallpaper and widget sets that can be further customized to suit your needs. This version of Sense only comes with one preloaded, but hitting the 'Get More' button on the upper right will take you to the HTC Hub where you can download additional Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you want to quickly change your phone's functionality, such as going from work to home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements. The Desire V comes with a total of two preloaded skins, although like with Scenes, it's easy to get more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Drawer uses a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in a similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes since Sense went ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main problem here is with how widgets are selected - they are shown four at a time and there's a lot of scrolling involved. Widgets are available in multiple versions - usually differing in size, but also functionality - and they're all dumped into the list, so you're scrolling through a lot of duplicates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old setup of picking a widget and then adjusting its size (if applicable) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two fields appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You can drop the widget on either one to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it is highlighted, Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area no longer has the list of recent apps - it's reserved for notifications only. No more tabs and toggles either, although you get a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the task switcher button on any screen displays a list of all your recently accessed apps, which you can remove with a swipe to the left or right. This is really just a quick way to access apps you've used recently, as swiping away doesn't kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To actually terminate a running app, you have to close it via the traditional task manager we've become familiar with from Gingerbread. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Stop All button too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we've already mentioned, the ICS build which graces the Desire V is one we were first introduced to when we examined HTC's One series phones. This time around, however, we aren't dealing with a powerful Cortex-A9 processor under the hood, but rather a mere 1GHz low-power Cortex-A5, and we're curious to see what HTC has held back from a software standpoint in order to keep performance up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging by how extensively re-written and optimized the code behind the new Android 4.0 build is, we expect the 1GHz processor to perform better in our web browsing benchmarks than its Gingerbread counterparts, but we didn't really expect it to break any records.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 tests the GPU of mobile and while the Desire V's 20 frames per second are enough to top the other single-core devices, they hardly suggest spectacular gaming performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In SunSpider and BrowserMark the Desire V was again able to get some good overall results. The results indicate pretty good web browsing performance, especially considering the specifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the ICS optimizations were enough to get some extra bang out of the measly processor, but let's keep in mind that it's primarily that processor that puts the Desire V squarely in the budget category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing on the Desire V is generally a decent experience, with the notable exception of flash content, which introduces a significant amount of lag.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has great SNS integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire V has HTC's elaborate phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have your contact list, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Google contacts, Facebook, or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and the fourth one called "Gallery" pulls up all the albums that contact has created on Flickr or Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. You can link to another contact or Facebook account pressing the "chains" icon in the upper right of the main contact screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transfer app is here to help you switch from your old phone. It supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth. It's an old but useful feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is Desire V's pi?¨ce de r?©sistance. After all, the dual-SIM capability of the device is its main selling feature. This means you can receive text messages and make calls from both SIM cards without problems. The only limitation is that you can't use the two SIMs at the same time, so if you are having a call in progress on one of the SIM cards, the other won't be operational and report the phone as turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V has a dedicated SIM card manager to configure how calls and data are handled on both cards. From there, you can also enabled and disable each SIM card as you please, without the need to restart the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After our usual telephony testing, the HTC Desire V had no problems with reception and the in-call audio was clear and satisfyingly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the Desire V displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Desire V fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored an Average mark placing just below the halfway point of our ranking.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the Desire V are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's the Google+ Messenger, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it. Furthermore, you can choose which SIM card to handle the text message delivery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Desire V boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. Texting takes a bit of getting used to in portrait mode, which is understandable given the small screen size. Still, it's enough to get the job done and things get a little better if you flip the phone to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can either add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple mail services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the Desire V lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android-ish gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery is a custom job, but stacks photos just like the vanilla Android gallery. The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can choose to show/hide camera shots, All photos or All videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Albums dropdown lets you view local or online albums. On the cloud side, you get Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, Picasa or SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos. Some files have an icon indicating it's not a still photo but a video instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'll need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom up to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player onboard the HTC Desire V, which means that video files have to be accessed via the Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video interface offers a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video support on the Desire V was a mixed bag - as expectd, 1080p videos were a no go and 720p were quite choppy. It was able to play most standard resolution file formats we threw at it - AVI, MP4, MKV - though it did choke on some old XviD-encoded AVI videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio or No effects (as long as you are using a pair of headphones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available, although you have to have a subtitle file in the same directory as the video to be able access the subtitle options. These include the ability to select a subtitle file (if there is more than one in the same directory), as well as adjust the character encoding, which can be useful in getting those non-Latin subtitles to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can also opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V offers the Beats Audio sound enhancement to boost the sonic experience, although at a slightly dumbed-down variant. Gone are all the Beats Audio presets we're used to in other HTC phones, all you're really able to do on the Desire V is toggle it on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a widget that shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can pause playback or skip tracks directly by pressing the relevant button but you cannot unlock the phone into the full featured Music Player by dragging the widget into the ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can play the sound through the headphones or the loudspeaker, although you need to have a headset plugged in at all times to be used as an antenna. There's no Beats enhancement here though, or a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a data connection, you can use TuneIn radio instead of relying on your local FM radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V did decently well in our audio quality test. It's by far not the most talented musician around but, given its lowly standing in the pecking order, its performance should still be considered a nice surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Desire V get some pretty good results. The only two weak points of its performance were the cut-off extreme bass frequencies and the slightly higher than average intermodulation distortion. The rest of the readings were nothing short of excellent and combined with the good volume levels make the Desire V a solid performer on this occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is relatively little degradation when headphones come into play. The stereo crosstalk rises a bit (and remains probably pretty good for the scenario) and the intermodulation distortion spikes unnoticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Shared camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V packs a 5MP auto-focus camera that does stills of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels and records WVGA video @ 21fps. There is a LED flash, but unfortunately no shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions, with the option to either take a video or snap a still image all from one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo/video taken. On the left are buttons for general settings and shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the shutter button. To record video, you tap the button below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on), while the shot mode button offers just a few very limited options - portrait, landscape, and low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the quality of the shots is concerned, the Desire V definitely leaves something to be desired. The noise reduction is far too aggressive, giving the image the rather unpleasant oil-painting look. The color balance was not always stellar either and the colors are a bit over-saturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, this is certainly not the best 5MP camera we've seen, but in this price range you can't expect much more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V joins the other 5MP shooters in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sub-par video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The WVGA (800 x 480) recording capabilities of the Desire V are nothing to write home about, especially in this day and age when it seems that every other device out there is capable of 720p and even 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problems don't end with the low resolution, either, with videos usually hovering about the 21fps mark and coming out somewhat choppy. The colors are over-saturated too and the amount of resolved detail is nothing to write home about. The MP4 videos shot on the Desire V might do for the occasional YouTube upload, which you can then share on Facebook, but their quality doesn't suffice for much else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an untouched sample WVGA@21fps video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ample connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G, and HSDPA speeds of up to 7.2 Mbps. Local wireless connectivity features Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are most often used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great ICS browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V comes with the latest Android web browser, and because it runs on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, you can also install Chrome for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser's interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. You get the standard Menu dropdown on the right, but HTC have thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen (you have to pan to reveal them, which is a little annoying).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner. Incognito tabs are available if you want to bypass History, tracking cookies, form auto-fill stuff and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu options include a toggle to enable/disable Flash and another one to request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another ICS feature has the phone preload search results that it suspects you're going to open, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V comes with Flash support, although the 1GHz processor has a hard time keeping up. Clicking the 'Enable Flash support' option in the browser settings allowed for all the flash banners on our site to show up, but made the browsing experience so choppy it was pretty much unusable. YouTube videos will load and play in-line, although a lot of times it takes a while for them to show up. Flash games weren't playable either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great-looking PIM tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Desire V, with a mobile Office app to boot, that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word, Excel documents and presentations. There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can format the text style and color, justify the text, do lists (numbered or bullet points) in the Word editor. The Excel editor does support function editing, which some mobile editors don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also integrates with Dropbox and SkyDrive, which makes syncing documents between your computer and your phone a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), one you sync with your computer and easily show/hide events you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire V features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app. There's a world clock, to display the time in multiple locations, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings AccuWeather weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store and HTC Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, the HTC Hub is a good source of wallpapers and sound customizations - ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handful of apps, as well as customizations for skins and entire scenes as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation and location with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire V has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Demand for dual-SIM smartphones must be at an all-time high judging by how the leaders in the smartphone game are responding to it in what looks almost like a coordinated and sustained campaign. Pick a name at random from the Android Top Four - or five - and they each have at least a couple of options in their portfolio, ready to cater to different budgets and needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Samsung and Motorola have the biggest variety but the likes of LG, Sony and Acer are also keen to have a piece of the dual-SIM droid action. For the most part, some of the most recent dual-SIM smartphones we're going to look at simply add a second SIM slot to already existing models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has more than a few of them in the Galaxy Y Duos, Galaxy Ace Duos and Galaxy S Duos, but only the last of those is a proper competitor to the Desire V. The two have identically spec'd screens and quite similar chipsets, with the S Duos having a slight advantage in terms of available RAM. With the pricing also evenly matched, picking between the HTC Desire V and the Samsung Galaxy S Duos is all about your personal preference of UI - Sense or TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting alternative is the Acer Liquid Gallant Duo. Packing a 4.3" screen of qHD resolution and a more powerful chipset than the Desire V, this is arguably the most powerful dual-SIM droid currently on the market. It lacks the Sense UI eye-candy and added functionality, but it more than makes up for that with its lower price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid Gallant Duo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to compromise on the screen resolution and processing power, than you'll have quite a few more options to pick from. The LG Optimus L5 Dual, the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos, the Sony Xperia tipo dual and the Motorola Defy Mini XT321 are all dual-SIM droids that come with HVGA screens of various sizes and cost less than the Desire V. Then again those fail to provide the same kind of solid smartphone experience, though, so power users better stay away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Optimus L5 Dual E615 ? Motorola Defy Mini XT321 ? Sony Xperia tipo dual ? Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, dual-SIM droids have mushroomed and this is a trend HTC just cannot afford to stay away from. However, it does seem that the Taiwanese are going about it a bit differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It could be A) they considered entry-level dual-SIMs unnecessary, or B) they just wanted to position themselves near the top of a niche that's getting crowded. It's almost like HTC wanted to go straight after the biggest rival - and a perfect match in terms of specs -the Samsung Galaxy S Duos instead of wasting time on the small fish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Desire V could do well for HTC but it's probably more of an option to give to frequent travelers among their loyal users, rather than a phone that will win them new fans.</paragraph>
