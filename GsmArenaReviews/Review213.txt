			<paragraph>Samsung may be flying high on INNOV8 but they sure have at least a toe on the ground. Just recently they spilled the low-to-mid-end bag, so we don't forget a flagship is only as good as the fleet behind it. No handset in the handful they just recently dropped is likely to top the food chain but what a massive landing it was.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite duly, the first in the dozen to make it to the GSMArena shore is the B2700 toughie. The latest rugged handset by Samsung has the same level of dust and water splash resistance as the toughest of phones Sonim XP1. The feature set is the great difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're yet to see how hard it is to break the B2700, but a compass, pedometer, altimeter and a flashlight do make it harder to resist. Significantly cheaper than the Sonim XP1, Samsung B2700 is making a good go at the rugged phone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>B2700 is actually the second heavy duty phone of the house, topping the Samsung M110 rather trimmed down spec sheet with quite some extra features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 is the hot offer but it still has a few competitors to keep off its back: Sonim XP1, Sony Ericsson C702, and Nokia 5500 Sport. Rough and sporty they all are, but the tough phone looks are obviously less prominent in the C702 and 5500 Sport. Quite understandably, ruggedization is not their top priority. In C702 you get Cybershot imaging and GPS, while the Nokia 5500 Sport is Symbian-powered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Sonim XP1 and Samsung B2700 are set apart: durability is their line of business and they look it. Now, the XP1 goes a long way of torture testing. We are now to see if what the Sonim handles as a mere practical joke won't be lethal to the Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just bear in mind that unlike the Sonim XP1 there's no unconditional warranty this time, no keypad testing to half million presses and no commitment to operational range from sub zero to scorching hot so you better not try this at home. And no, we doubt it there will be hard-boiled Destroy this Phone marketing with the B2700. However there's a bunch of features instead that might just give it the right kind of edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still being among the first to het their hands on the B2700 we just couldn't stand the temptation of attempting to break it down too. You can take a peek at our murder attempts towards the end of this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK then, here's where we stand: there's a toughened body and a bunch of niceties worth protecting. Take this jump to give it a shot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B2700 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 measures 115 x 52 x 18mm and weighs 114 grams. The casing is made of plastic and hardened rubber. The phone will be offered in Black and Blue.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 is a hefty piece of work, but that's quite in line with the outdoor dress code. Size is on par with the Sonim XP1, and weight is kept well under control. Rounded edges and good ergonomics, the B2700 offers a nice and solid feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the front panel B2700 houses the protected earpiece and the secondary video call camera. Right under it is the 256K-color display of 176 x 220 pixel resolution and a 1.9" diagonal. Legibility is surprisingly good in bright sunlight, especially with the white Samsung theme. Brightness is adjustable and overall we have a screen of adequate quality. It's still tempting to imagine what might have been with QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you get at the top of the handset is the dedicated flashlight bulb and the conspicuous bottle-opener accent (no, it doesn't open any bottles, we've tried), which can serve as a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of B2700 houses the dedicated camera key and flashlight knob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker and the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of B2700 is pretty bare, except for the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B2700 keypad is great, with surprisingly soft and responsive keys. Much like Sonim XP1, Samsung B2700 proves ruggedization does not have to hurt usability. The soft-white keypad backlighting is strong and even. Nicely elevated and well-sized, the D-pad is a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside of B2700 are the loudspeaker grill and the 2-megapixel camera lens. The battery cover doesn't have a latch like Sonim XP1 but is still securely locked in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is released in two steps - first you slide the bottom part of the back panel and then pull the battery cover up. The battery compartment accommodates the SIM bed and the memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1300 mAh Li-Ion battery is said to provide up to 350 h of standby time and up to 5 h of talk time. The smallish display and generous battery capacity may as well add up to a good 4 - 5 days of regular use. We can't commit to a reasonable estimate though, given the early beta unit we're testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black rubber bumpers that frame the sides of the phone and the grooved rear give the B2700 a great grip. Solid, sporty and durable, the B2700 is fit for some serious outdoor action.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: surprisingly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The toughened casing of Samsung B2700 holds a bunch of sweet features and applications that make the armor worth having. You get 3G and video calls, an Image editor, FM Radio, MPEG4 and MP3 player, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth, and lots of extra tools like flashlight, digital compass, pedometer and altimeter. B2700 is not all muscle, there's some guts too: shock, splash and dust resistance go with quite a feature load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons with corresponding alphanumeric key shortcuts. Deeper level submenus also have keypad shortcuts besides being navigated with the D-pad. Image quality is adequate and the user interface is very fast and responsive. The only exception is the picture gallery, camera images taking a bit longer to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home screen is quite minimalist. The basic status readings are all there, such as signal strength, service provider, time, battery status and the two soft key functions. Additional icons also get displayed to indicate Bluetooth on, missed events, silent/vibrate mode, alarm on, etc. There a few wallpaper types to choose from: living world, image, from theme and photo slider.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality and earpiece and microphone performance are of special concern in rugged phones, as meeting the splash and dust resistance standards usually takes its toll on call clarity. We didn't have any issues of that sort with our unit - even though it's a pre-release one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on the loudspeaker performance is really impressive: Samsung B2700 is the third loudest phone we've ever tested. Here is how it stacks against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about our loudspeaker test, as well as the results of other tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung if you are fifth grader, as you always have some sort of dialing animation, or a choice of several ones. In the case of Samsung B2700 you have as many as six. The last two vary a little according to the theme or your location.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization options are nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Users can choose among three different preinstalled themes, each well known across a wide range of feature phones of the company. The B2700 has a default Samsung theme, as well as the Classic and Elegance Noire. If you want more, you have the option of creating your own theme in two modes - Easy and Expert.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of B2700 displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Smart Dialing function. Unluckily, B2700 - much like many other Samsung phones - searches only in the contact's first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 2 email addresses, URLs, postal address, and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field. Contact details or your whole contact list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give access to your call history. It has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls. From the Call log, users can add separate numbers to a reject list. Upon an incoming call from a blocked number, it is displayed in the call log as usual without any indication of it being blacklisted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 handles all common types of messages: SMS, MMS, and email. The first two share the same editor. You can convert your SMS to EMS by simply applying formatting or to MMS by inserting an image or other multimedia content. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try resending it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite straightforward. It can manage POP or IMAP accounts; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval. Even SSL support is there allowing to use it with mail services that require it, such as Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file browser in Samsung B2700 is the usual too, and does not differ from the one found in Samsung G400 Soul for example. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, even if you misplace a file, the handset will still handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser functionality is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones). Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one or multiple at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. Memory card reading is normal - we didn't find significant lags in reading a new memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested two microSDHC memory cards with Samsung B2700 - a 4GB one and an 8GB one. Both cards were recognized by the handset and we had no issues save for the initial recognition, which took about 30 to 50 sec. Both memory cards were full of music files and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B2700 picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening a folder that contains images. The pictures are seen as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view a picture in portrait mode only. You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is quite slow and irritating.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editing is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's a very capable application, especially for a feature phone. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung B2700 offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. However, we still doubt it anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously, especially on a 1.9" display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player surprisingly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Affordable rugged phones are usually underpowered in terms of extra applications, but Samsung B2700 is a pleasant exception. Its music player is quite decent, the missing equalizer option pretty much the only compromise. The inadequate 26 MB built-in memory doesn't have to bother you, as the microSD card slot can handle up to 8GB of music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composer. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. There are neither equalizer presets, nor wide and surround options in Samsung B2700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B2700 comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't have many features, the basic player doesn't even support fullscreen or landscape mode, yet fast-forward and rewind are among the players features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Passable 2 Megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 has a 2 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's no LED flash though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot, mosaic shot and frame), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, etc.), and white balance. Unfortunately, the camera can be used in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is just passable. Colors are rendered relatively well, but contrast is a bit harsh. In an attempt to keep noise down, much detail is blurred away. This is most obvious when you shoot a uniform surface with tiny accents on it. In such scenes the fine detail would be lost due to the strong noise suppression. This gives your images a kind of painted look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, imaging is hardly a priority for B2700 and the price range just won't accommodate more than that. Bear in mind also that it's a beta version, so image quality could still improve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples produced by the 2 megapixel camera of Samsung B2700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the video recording capabilities of the camera. Samsung B2700 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for some of the available options. The clips are recorded in the miserly QCIF resolution at 15fps and 3gp format. Those kinds of videos are only good for MMS use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung B2700 you can count on UMTS and quad-band GPRS/EDGE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, B2700 also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. There is also A2DP support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extra features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B2700 offers a few niceties that go well with rugged phones: flashlight, digital compass, pedometer and altimeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The digital compass appears to be very accurate. It needs quick calibration upon every start - just as the one we saw on the Nokia 6210 Navigator. The Altitude meter is integrated in the compass app. Its accuracy is not top of the line but we haven't seen an accurately working digital consumer altimeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pedometer appears to be a nifty piece of software. A nice feature allows a goal to be set in terms of number of steps taken, or calories burnt. An alarm can be set so you don't lose track of your goal. Users have to fill in basic information about height and weight, which the application uses for its calculations. And finally, the pedometer counter can be displayed on screen for convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings screens remind much of the Samsung F110 Adidas. The B2700 pedometer seems to be working accurately but it takes some free walking before it adjusts to your stride and starts performing its best.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ruggedness<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is the main course for tonight. Probably the most important feature of the Samsung B2700 is its durability and it now came the time to put it to a test. We did put the phone through some really serious torture and much to our amazement it survived it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While at the beginning we had trouble deciding which test should go first so that we don't break the phone before we are done. However, having seen how it handled the challenges with only minor damages to the body, we are safe to conclude that it was unnecessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started the experiments with something simple - dropping the B2700 on asphalt from about meter - meter and a half height. The phone passed the test with flying colors, without even a scratch but this was almost expected from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next task was much more complicated - the pavement isn't nearly as gentle to the electronic gadgets as the asphalt. A meter and a half flight downwards, ending with a hard hit on the rocks isn't something that every other phone out there can survive. Well, Samsung B2700 isn't every other phone so it did live through this with minimal damage suffered. In all fairness, the B2700 did disassembled on two of the occasions but we put the battery back in place and it was back on track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still Samsung B2700 did suffer some minor casualties in this test, but nothing too serious. After all having a few scratches in a test where every normal phone would be totaled is quite an achievement. Besides as you can see from the photos there is nothing you cannot live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next on our schedule was running the B2700 over with a car. One would think that more than a ton and a half of load would be enough to break its spirit but that would be completely wrong. Apart from getting a little dirty the Samsung B2700 showed no other evidence of having suffered what it just did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally after getting the Samsung B2700 dirty we had to clean it so we thought - why not put it in the sink. Being as good in the water as gold-winning Michael Phelps wasn't on the B2700 specs sheet but it should probably be. We could hardly bear the arrogant look the phone gave us when we finally gave up and returned it in one piece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    </paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B2700 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important, and private.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of alarm slots are also five, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are a voice memo recorder, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are the kind of features to expect in a tough rugged phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a note or a task is also available in B2700.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fun corner<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung B2700 offers a sneak-peek of 4 fairly amusing games - WSOP (Poker game), TetrisMania, DiamondTwister (a version of Bejeweled game), and BrainChallengeVol2. All of them are trial versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WSOP and TetrisMania are well known games, which hardly need detailed description.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DiamondTwister is an offshoot of the popular Bejeweled game, while The BrainChallengeVol2 is a quiz, the kind we like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To wrap it up, B2700 makes no compromise with durability but the more important thing is Samsung make no compromise with the package. The maker could've easily gotten away with keeping the handset trimmed down on features and staking everything on ruggedness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty, this very feature set in any other phone would've inspired a few approving nods at most and the observation that low-to-mid range phones are duly evolving. Nice and responsive interface, quad-band support, 3G with video calls, memory card slot, FM radio and music player may be just taken for granted these days but not in a phone that takes durability so seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tough and sporty Samsung B2700 is keen to deliver on all counts and strives to stay relevant with some extra goodies that do belong under its armor: a flashlight, compass, altimeter, and pedometer. Our experience tells us this is one of the most consistent and well-rounded packages in the lower midrange. Our sources claim it will go around at about 150 EUR before tax. How's that for a hot start?</paragraph>
