			<paragraph>The size of a credit card, a luxurious look, plenty of functions and a leather case with a built-in battery are some of the characteristics of Samsung P310.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stylish and fashionable phones created to represent their owners are nowadays occupying a significant share of the mobile market. At the same time each manufacturer is constantly trying to offer users something special and innovative. In November 2005 Samsung launched the P300 model, whose design was especially non-traditional: it resembled a calculator. Today we are presenting its successor Samsung P310 - another state-of-the-art phone, which you will hardly mistake with another model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Samsung P310 ? a stylish phone with size of a credit card  </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Note: The test sample is a pre-market version. For this reason it was not possible for us to test its battery durability, nor was it possible to take pictures or shoot video. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A black plate covered with chromium<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design Samsung P310 follows the line of its forerunner, but its chromium-covered plates make it look far more luxurious. The size characteristics of the phone (86 x 54 x 9 mm) reveal an especially slim body reminding a credit card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Samsung P310 in a palm  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the non-traditional key distribution and the panoramic display of Samsung P310 result from its small height. Its front black plate is wrapped up in a silver frame from all three sides, but the top. The phone weighs 75 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Hidden behind a credit card  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the phone are made of black plastics. Here you will find several control elements: a dual volume button on the left and a key activating the camera on the right; right next to the latter there is a dual system connector for the earphones, the charger and the data cable protected by a practical sliding cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;       Mere 9 mm thick  </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;     The system connector is located on the right side ? the charger/case connector is located in the bottom of the device  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great part of the rear panel is basically the metal cover of the battery. When you remove it, you need to unlock the sliding protector on the bottom of the phone. Once you have removed it, you will see a 550 mAh Li-Ion battery, which should supply Samsung P310 with enough energy for 300 hours of stand-by time or 60 minutes of call time. The SIM card slot and the slot for a microSD memory card are located right beside the battery. Unfortunately, the extraction of the memory card is impossible without removing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The cover hides a battery, a SIM card and a memory card ? the latter cannot be extracted unless the battery has been removed  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the black plastic rear panel features the non-protected lens of the 2 megapixel camera, a LED, and a connector for an external antenna tapped with a black cover.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A case charged with energy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, a standard part of the retail package is a simple, but especially elegant leather case, which protects the phone pretty successfully. When the phone is placed in the case, a click notifies that end position has been reached. Extraction is facilitated by a side-button. Samsung P310 holds firmly inside the case. If you want to work with the phone, all you need to do is open out the front half of the case and base it on the edge of your palm, so that it does not close unwillingly. When calls are made, it is also necessary that you hold the front half of the case with your fingers; otherwise it will touch your chin or lips and disturb you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     There is a second battery built-in this leather case   &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s most attractive about the case, however, is the 800 mAh Li-Ion battery built in its firm back side. The latter is connected to the phone through three contacts hidden in the slot of the case and charges the device in case of emergency (indicated by a second battery state indicator on the display). As the device we were testing was a pre-production version, we did not manage to find out, which battery first provides it with energy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The battery in the case ? the camera works even if the phone is in the case  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shooting with the phone inside the case is possible thanks to a special opening for the camera lens and the LED on the back. When in the case, the phone?s weight doubles due to the second built-in battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Moving the case  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The keypad has gone fashion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310?s keypad is quite unusual due to the uncommon form factor of the phone. Its numeric part consists of 6 dual keys ? a solution notably different from any standard key distribution method. All you need to get used to it is practice. Each dual key substitutes 2 common keys, of which one is selected by a press on the left, the other one ? by a press on the right. The keys are located quite close one to another, which leads to frequent mistakes in typing. Touch orientation or press reaction are not perfect, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Getting accustomed to the keypad will take longer  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functional part of the keypad is dominated by a large round four-way control key, which ? again untraditionally ? lacks a confirming center. The latter lies right next on the left. Around the control key you will also find two standard keys for call dialing and call termination and a correcting key. Two context keys made of touch sensors are located beneath the display; both are sensitive enough and easy to control. All in all, the functional part of the keypad could hardly be characterized as particularly user-friendly or comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All keys feature a low uplift; backlighting is white but rather uneven. In the menu you can set up whether the keypad should be illuminated all day around or in the evening only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     It?s a pity, but the control key has no confirming center  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing requires special efforts due to the unusual design of the phone. The creation of a longer text, for example, became a painful process for most of us. The phone is extremely small and the keys reach the very edge of its body. This often leads to uncomfortable handhold and unnatural thumb folding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Backlighting is a little bit uneven  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: quality in landscape<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As expected, a stylish phone comes with a high-quality display. Samsung P310 is equipped with a brilliant QVGA display supporting 262K colors. Its resolution is 320 x 240 pixels. Perhaps it is not necessary, but let us underline that we are talking about an active TFT display with highly fine picture and beautiful color visualization. Its horizontal orientation is quite extraordinary, but also inevitable due to the small size of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     The landscape display ? the superb quality is Samsung?s reserved mark  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The intensity of the display backlighting as well as its active time could be controlled from the menu. As soon as you close the case, however, the phone recognizes this action, the display goes out and the keypad backlighting switches off immediately. To check missed events it is necessary to bring the phone to life by pressing a random key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Interface and control: uncertainties here and there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 has the same user interface as the other recent handsets of the Korean manufacturer such as Samsung D900. You can enter the main menu from stand-by by pressing the left context key. The right one is reserved for the phonebook; it is not user-configurable. Unfortunately, when the phone is on stand-by, the confirming button opens the WAP browser as usual. Each way of the navigation key but the up-way can be assigned a short-cut access to one of 20 items. The up-way only opens the ?My menu?, where you can organize five other frequently applied functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Stand-by display ? the calendar as a background  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stand-by display offers numerous customizing options. The top bar is reserved for standard icons like those indicating signal strength, battery state (for both batteries), active ringing mode etc. Beneath you will see a grey band with the actual date and a digital clock. The operator name can be situated just bellow the grey band, in the bottom or deactivated completely. Font size and color are user-configurable as well. The bottom line is reserved for descriptions of the functions assigned to the context keys. The month view of the calendar could be set to appear constantly on the stand-by display: quite practical indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be visualized as a matrix of nine icons or as a standard list of items, but saturation is poor in any case. The main menu is available in two color versions: a stylish black one where only selected icons are colorful and a generally more vivid white version. All other menu items consist of text fitted in pop-up windows in sub-menus. These windows are entered through a press on the horizontal way of the navigation key. The only significant inconvenience here is that the menu remembers the last visited item and offers it like a priority one when you enter the menu again. This means occasional returns in the menu. In general, however, the menu responds immediately. Shortcut keys are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Main menu ? another color scheme  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you move in the menu, pay attention and do not forget about the unusual functions of the confirming key and the left context keys. The first one selects items, while the second one saves them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     The menu in the form of a list ? the sub-menu window opens up straight away  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2 megapixel camera with many settings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 features an integrated 2 megapixel camera. The maximum available image size is 1600 x 1200 pixels. Regrettably, we cannot evaluate the quality of Samsung P310? images as the shooting mechanism of the camera in the tested model did not work. The display was still white. The camera is activated from the menu or through a longer press on the corresponding side key. The latter as well as the confirming button also work as a release key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      The camera view-finder ? camera mode ? camera?s context menu  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera menu is very rich. For example, there are 6 size options, three image quality levels, white balance, exposure compensation, sensitivity settings, frames, color effects, mosaic images etc. A digital zoom and a LED are available too. The two main cons here are the lack of automatic focus and the impossibility to save pictures straight on a memory card. You have to move them from the internal memory onto the card manually. At the same time, in the file manager the address structures of the phone memory and the memory card are completely separated. Images can be sent out via Bluetooth, in an email or through a data cable, and even straight to a printer supporting PictBridge. The Samsung P310 camera also shoots audio-video records in MP4 format, whose maximum resolution is 352 x 288 pixels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls: a thousand of names in a tiny mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main phone function in Samsung P310 is its multi-item phonebook with a capacity for 1000 names. Each entry could contain a first and a last name, 5 phone numbers, an email address, and a note. . Besides, there is an option for assigning a picture and a ringtone to every contact. Names can be organized in groups, which however cannot be used as filters for incoming calls. Each group can be assigned a picture and a ringtone. The content of the phone memory and the one of the SIM card are visualized simultaneously. Searching is done through gradual typing. The speaker sound is good, with enough volume capacity for loud environment. Samsung P310 also offers a loud speaker and a voice recorder (hidden deep down in the menu), which could also be used as an answer phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Searching the phonebook ? a view at a contact ? editing a contact  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 does not have 3G support, but works in GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz bands. Ringing profiles are substituted by a silent mode activated through a longer press on the hash key.. On the other hand, in the menu you can choose, whether the phone should alert about incoming calls with a melody, with vibration and then a melody, or with vibration only. Samsung P310 rings in 64-voice polyphony or uses MP3 and AAC files. The phone has also an airplane mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      A indefinite phonebook menu in the tester phone ? a view at the call register  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad as an obstacle for typing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone offers all types of messages. Standard SMS are typed in five lines. There is a countdown of characters left from the weird number 1836 as well as an option for sub-message count (you could type up to 12 of these). The T9 dictionary facilitates typing by suggesting words without diacritics. Thanks to the EMS support short text messages could also contain small black &amp; white images and animations; text can be formatted too. Anyway, considering the size of Samsung P310, there is no doubt that this phone is not meant for frequent SMS typists. Instead of torturing yourself with pressing those tiny keys you?d better simply call straight away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Writing SMS ? reading SMS ? browsing the message register  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS memory offers space for 200 items. Received messages can not be alerted of by any sound though, which is a pity. You can choose out of 10 preset sounds, which are played every two minutes until the corresponding message is read. MMS can be assigned a different melody and thus easily recognized. Received messages appear in five lines. The phone also provides you the especially comfortable option to select 10 phone numbers from which the incoming messages are automatically deleted and you do not even come to realize that they have been received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any MMS can contain text, sounds, an image and a video, but cannot exceed 300 KB. At the same time each message can have several pages. Received MMS are stored in the same folder like SMS. The option to block all MMS coming from 10 preset numbers is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      New message ? creating MMS ? writing a new email  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with several accounts; it is compatible with POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP protocols. You can download either entire emails or just their headers ? in preset intervals. The phone works with attachments of maximum 300 KB. Messages can be filtered by both author and subject.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Seamless work with MS Office documents<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual in mobiles, the basic organizing application in Samsung P310 is its calendar. It is very well elaborated, which proves the long-term experience of this manufacturer in this particular area. The calendar offers a month, week, and day view; the week could start on either Monday or Sunday. You can insert three various event types in the calendar - meeting, anniversary and task ? and up to 100 items of each type. Each event type can be alerted of in a preset period in advance, while meetings can even be repeated daily, weekly or monthly. The calendar also features a task manager. Tasks can be separately visualized, given priority, and marked off once completed. Synchronization with MS Outlook runs without problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      Month, week, and day view at the calendar  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three alarm clocks in Samsung P310. They will wake you up with any sound stored in the phone, even if it is switched off. The days the alarms are active are user-configurable as well. The phone fits in 100 text notes, each of which can contain no more than 100 characters. Among other organizing functions you will also find a good calculator, a voice recorder limited to one hour of recording time, a world time application, a unit converter, a countdown timer, and a stopwatch with four intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     The final version of Samsung P310 will not contain a ?mobile stopwatch", but an alarm clock only  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features a viewer for documents in DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF formats, which is a very useful but rather rare function. Apart from being scrolled by presses on the navigation key each document can be zoomed in or out, turned around to a 90° angle or searched through. When the phone browses a document, it needs a couple of seconds to focus newly visualized parts. Nevertheless, the office viewer works fine in case of emergency and what?s most important ? it is present in very few non-OS phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>         Extra applications  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fun: a TV screen instead of a display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 is equipped with a good music player, which organizes files into four playlists; shuffle and repeat functions are also available. The player works with MP3, AAC, and AAC+ formats; it has a good-quality loudspeaker and comes with a standard earphone set, which Samsung attaches to all its models and which we had the chance to test. Music can be listened through stereo earphones via Bluetooth as well. The sound performed by the earphone set in the retail package is not brilliant but is fully sufficient for users with standard expectations. The headset feature a volume control with a microphone and a button for call control and can be therefore used as a handsfree set. Regretfully, it is not possible to connect another, different type of earphones with standard jack. The player offers two more function for sound improvement: an equalizer and stereo widening. There is no FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Samsung P310 is delivered with earphones whose cable features a microphone  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone plays videos in 3GP and MP4 formats. Records can be forwarded or watched in a fullscreen mode by pressing the hash key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;    File manager ? viewing files (the title Bluetooth is a mistake originating from the non-final firmware)  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pretty interesting extra here is the option for connection between the phone and a TV through a special cable. This cable, however, is not part of the standard retail package. Once such a connection has been established, you should be able to see the images on the phone display transferred onto the TV screen. Samsung P310 supports PAL and NTSC coding; selection is made from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has prepared three Java games for boring moments: the classical Lemmings, a good mini-golf, and the football FIFA 06. All three games feature beautiful graphic design, but playing may not be easy due to the uncomfortable keypad layout. If you prefer other games, you can download them from the Internet, as the phone supports Java 2.0. If you download games via Bluetooth or save them on the memory card, they will not start running afterwards, so be careful. Java in Samsung P310 is quite slow according to the results of the application jBenchmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The phone offers three attractive games  </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data with EDGE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 supports the data transfer technologies GPRS and EDGE, both in Class 10. The absence of UMTS is more or less acceptable even though Samsung P310 is a stylish and quite expensive phone. Nearby devices are connected via Bluetooth 2.0 and through a data connector with a USB cable (the cable is delivered as a standard part of the retail package). There is no Infrared port. To provide synchronization between the phone and a PC you need first to download all the necessary software. We did not find a special software CD in the retail package. When the phone is connected to the phone through the data cable, the memory card does not appear as a new removable device under Windows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Browsing in the Internet  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 has a good web browser, which is even able to show simple Internet pages. Occasionally there are problems with diacritics. You can not only enter addresses directly, but also save favorite pages of yours. WAP visualization counts with 15 lines on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Typing an address in the browser ? settings ? history  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>For fashion lovers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P310 is a highly stylish phone, whose original look sends it up onto the top of the cream among very few competitors. Its main mission is to represent its owner in higher society. In this sense, you should carefully evaluate your needs and state you preferences. If you want a user-friendly, multi-functional phone for common daily use, you?d better search somewhere else as the unpractical layout of Samsung P310?s keypad will cause you numerous problems. The rest of the drawbacks we mentioned in the course of this review are relatively insignificant if not ignorable given the type of public the phone targets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the Samsung P310 market price is highly competitive for this extraordinary high-end phone.</paragraph>
