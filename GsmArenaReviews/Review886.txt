		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the Finnish company's first Windows tablet, the Nokia Lumia 2520 cannot complain about lack of attention from both brand loyalists and industry pundits. Announced alongside the Lumia 1520 phablet, the slate expands Nokia's product lineup beyond smartphones, thus allowing the company to compete with the heavyweights in yet another highly-lucrative segment of the consumer tech market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in the case of its latest generation Windows Phones, Nokia has opted for using some of the most capable hardware available around for its tablet. The Nokia Lumia 2520 packs a stunning 10.1-inch IPS LCD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset, LTE connectivity, and a 6.7MP camera with Carl Zeiss lens. Not to mention the usual host of Nokia's proprietary apps and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of Nokia Lumia 2520 features, followed by some of its disadvantages we found after using the tablet for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at the key features reveals that, as far as specs go, the Nokia Lumia 2520 is well-equipped to go head to head with the finest tablet offerings available on the market. The Lumia's display resolution falls slightly behind its top-end iOS and Android rivals', though Nokia has made up for the pixel shortage with superb contrast, sunlight legibility, and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, just like in the case of the Microsoft Surface 2 we recently reviewed, we can't help but be a tad skeptical about the presence of Windows 8.1 RT as the OS of choice on Nokia's first tablet. The new wave of affordable, Intel Atom based touchscreen tablets running the full Windows 8.1 questions the very existence of the ARM-centric branch of the OS. The same goes for the obvious lack of hardware vendors willing to utilize the lightweight Windows version in newly developed products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a manner taken straight from its Windows Phone playbook, Nokia has countered the limitations of the OS by adding a number of useful, exclusive apps to the Lumia 2520. They include HERE Maps, Nokia Camera, Nokia Video Director, and Nokia Storyteller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we will kick the review off by unboxing the tablet, followed by a close look at its design and hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Nokia Lumia 2520 is basic. Inside the tablet's box, you will find a charger, a tool for accessing the SIM and microSD slots, as well as some booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Microsoft Surface 2, the Nokia Lumia 2520 has an optional keyboard cover. Alongside the full QWERTY and trackpad, the keyboard cover packs an extra 2,027mAh battery and a duo of full USB ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard cover for the Nokia Lumia 2520 is essential for utilizing its massive productivity talents. Its two major downsides come from its price tag and its considerable weight. At $149 and 571 grams respectively, both add significantly to the tablet's bottom line in both literal and figurative sense.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looks of the Nokia Lumia 2520 hold no surprises. The tablet follows closely the design language of the Nokia Lumia smartphone range. Thanks to its rectangular shape and rounded edges, the slate literally looks like a stretched out Lumia smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above considered, the Nokia Lumia 2520 looks handsome in the flesh, if a bit too familiar. After all, the current Lumia family design language debuted back in mid-2011 with the MeeGo totting Nokia N9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like its smartphone relatives, the Nokia Lumia 2520 is available in a variety of colors, and matte or glossy finish. The colors on offer are black, white, cyan, and red. The black and cyan color schemes come with a matte finish, while the white and red are glossy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matte black version which we got to review can easily claim to be the most understated-looking tablet around. We also reckon that the matt finish is easier to live with on a daily basis, as it handles smudgy fingerprints much better that its glossy counterpart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Nokia Lumia 2520 are 267 x 168 x 8.9 mm, while its weight tips the scale at the relatively substantial 615 grams. The latter means that the Nokia Lumia 2520, while a tad more compact than the Microsoft Surface 2, is heftier than the high-end iOS and Android offerings it will compete with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is up to Nokia's usual high standards. The Lumia 2520 is superbly put together and ready to tackle plenty of daily use and abuse - from the solid polycarbonate body, all the way to display covered by Corning's Gorilla Glass 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 features a 10.1" Full HD ClearBlack IPS display with multi-touch support. The screen boasts enhanced outdoor visibility and an orientation sensor. Its pixel density is 218ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast and viewing angles of the Lumia's display are superb, as is its sunlight legibility. Nokia has been treating its top-end smartphones to high-quality displays for some time now, so we can't say we didn't expect one on the company's first tablet as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subjectively, the Nokia Lumia 2520 hands-down beats the screen of its Windows 8.1 RT sibling, the Microsoft Surface 2, in both contrast and viewing angles. Brightness is better too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things however, take a downturn when Nokia's offering goes head to head with the iOS and Android's finest. Apple, Samsung, and ASUS all offer tablets with significantly higher resolution than the Lumia 2520. To put things simply, 1920 x 1080 pixels is no longer considered cutting edge for a $500 tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the 2MP front-facing camera and its indicator light can be found. An ambient light sensor and proximity sensor, as well as a microphone are also located there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, you will find the Windows start button. The tablet's front-facing stereo speakers are there as well. They keep a pleasantly low profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the charging port are located on the left. They look quite alike at a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB and the microHDMI ports are located on the right hand side of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key, the volume rocker, as well as the pop-out tray for the microSIM and microSD card are located on top. The tray is removed via the supplied ejector tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary connector for Nokia's keyboard cover sits alone on the bottom. There is nothing else there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia Lumia 2520 is home of the 6.7MP Zeiss camera, an NFC connectivity tag, and a couple of logos. Next to the camera sits a secondary microphone dedicated to noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powered by a beefy 8,120mAh battery, the Nokia Lumia 2520 did quite well in our battery test. The Finnish slate bested its Surface 2 relative and scored highly in both the web browsing and video playback section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It must be noted that the web browsing test was conducted over a Wi-Fi network. Should you choose to surf the web over LTE, a drop in the battery endurance can be reasonably expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Nokia Lumia 2520 is a pleasure. The rounded edges of the slate make it easy to hold. Its considerable weight however, can potentially cause discomfort during prolonged use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nokia Lumia 2520 deserves nothing but high marks for its build quality and ergonomics. Battery life is impressive too - it complements the tablet's productivity credentials quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the OS of the Nokia Lumia 2520, as well as the manufacturer's exclusive apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows 8.1 RT at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows RT is a relatively new OS - it's only been around for an year now and it is different from both the regular Windows and the Windows Phone OS you may have seen elsewhere. RT (short for Runtime) is made to run on ARM processors (like the ones in today's smartphones and tablets) instead on the regular Intel and AMD processors that we use in our computers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows RT relies only on the Windows Store for apps and you can't install any legacy software. None of your Windows Vista/7/8 apps are directly available on Windows RT, unless their developers release a compatible version and Microsoft claims that making one is pretty easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important difference is that Windows RT is only available pre-installed on devices and it's not available directly to end users - only OEMs have access to it. After the initial enthusiasm, the OEMs in question have started moving away from the platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right before the Lumia 2520 was announced, there were even rumors that Microsoft will be scrapping the project altogether. So far (November 2013), there is no official announcement on the matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exact version which the Nokia Lumia 2520 boots is Windows 8.1 RT. The latest version of the ARM-based OS is not a major update, though it still brings some welcome changes to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the Lumia 2520 with Windows 8.1 RT in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Start menu is comprised of live tiles just like on Windows Phone. The difference is that the live tile grid is scrollable horizontally rather than vertically, which makes sense given the default orientation of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch gesture on the screen shrinks the grid of tiles, which is particularly handy if you've got a lot of tiles and you are starting to get lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe from the top or bottom of the main screen reveals the context menu. This gesture is enabled in every app, as well as on the Start screen. When in the latter, it reveals the "Customize" menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To select a tile you need to do a vertical swipe on it - mass selection for unpinning and uninstalling is also available. This works on all sorts of files in Start - pictures, documents, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live tiles can be resized just like in Windows Phone - there are four sizes available now as opposed to three in Windows 8 RT. An option to turn live tiles off is also available. Some tiles are nothing more than static icons even after you make them bigger but others (like Calendar) help bring more information right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up from the Start menu reveals the full list of installed apps. A pinch gesture reveals an alphabetical grid which lets you quickly search the list of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is done by swiping from the left edge of the screen towards the center. There's an alternate way of doing this - a short swipe from the left edge of the screen and then quickly back displays a vertical thumbnail grid of the recent apps. If you're using a conventional keyboard with your Windows 8.1 RT, a simple Alt+Tab gets the job done just like it has for ages now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Split screen mode has been greatly revamped in Windows 8.1 RT. It now allows users to view apps side by side in equally-sized windows, as opposed to a large and a small one in the previous version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Charms menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Charms menu is available across the OS. It's accessible via a swipe from the right edge of the screen and gives access to search, share, Start, devices and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Devices detects every device in your network's Home/Workgroup - if you're logged on to one that is. You can send content to these devices through this menu. Share does the same, but using different apps to share depending on the type of content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu gives you quick options for Wireless, sound, screen, notifications, power and keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are sliders to adjust the brightness and volume of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also select which keyboard to use and choose to restart, shut down or sleep using the quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a shortcut to the detailed settings menu here. From there you can personalize the look of Windows 8.1 RT. You can choose lockscreen wallpaper, select apps that can run in the background and show notifications or detailed statuses on the lockscreen - for instance the Calendar will display your upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next option is the Start screen. You can choose a color scheme and background. There are many options in every color you can think of but you can't use your own picture as wallpaper - you have to select one of the preinstalled ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to change your account photo as well. It is done by tapping on the top right corner where the user account information is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple users on Windows 8.1 RT, just like you can in Windows 8. Users can have their own tile grid, apps, preferences, etc. If you have more than one Windows 8 or RT device you can enable settings sync between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be disabled on the lockscreen altogether and you can switch off the sounds. You can also configure which apps can push notifications to your lockscreen. However you cannot control the way notifications are presented, only switch them on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can choose which apps to use while searching. There's the handy option to delete the search history too. Sharing settings are very limited. Currently you can only share via Mail, People and SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general settings handle time, spelling, screen automatic brightness, language options, reinstall Windows, etc. The Devices section handles the PCs and devices in a Wi-Fi Home/Workgroup. You can add new and connect with existing ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 8.1 RT lets you choose which settings you wish to sync with SkyDrive or disable the feature. Your personalization, passwords, app, browser settings and more can be synced between your PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modern UI is really fluid and responsive. All UI transitions and animations are buttery-smooth and we didn't notice any lag. This is hardly a surprise, as the Snapdragon 800 SoC is one of the speedier around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limited desktop functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, Windows 8.1 RT 8.1 features desktop mode. The biggest change compared to the previous version is the presence of a start button. The latter takes you to the Start menu - it doesn't act like a Windows Start button of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important feature of the classical desktop is that it allows you to access the file system on your tablet. The internal storage and every additional drive connected to the device are displayed here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are organized just like on any computer running Windows 7 or 8. You can search folders, jump straight to the Desktop, Libraries, Homegroup, Computer and Network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 comes with a microUSB 3.0 port and a microSD card slot. Whenever a USB flash drive is plugged into the slate you get prompted to choose what to do. Autoplay includes the option to import content and open the folder to view files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 had no trouble with any file we threw at it. DivX, XviD, avi, mp4, mov and MKV movies played without a hassle, all the way up to 1080p. Photos weren't a problem either and the same goes for PDFs and docs - none of those actually required us to install any kind of third party software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While in Desktop mode, you are free to copy, cut and paste files all across the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although you cannot install legacy apps on Windows 8.1 RT, like you would on any x86 or x64 version of Windows, there are a couple of familiar faces present that will make you feel at home. Notepad, Calculator, Command prompt and Paint are all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the same goes for the Control panel. You can uninstall apps, manage accounts, time and language options, view hardware information, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When launched, the task manager shows you the currently running apps with the option to stop them or you could request to see more details. The latter displays a color-coded grid of your running apps with a per-app breakdown of CPU, RAM, Disk and Network usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a performance tab that lets you examine the CPU load over time as well as the load on RAM, storage, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App History shows how much system resources your apps have used since the tablet has been active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People is in charge of contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Windows 8.1 RT stores all of your contact information, rounded up from all of the accounts you sync with. You can view contacts from your Microsoft account, Facebook, Hotmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's New tab also made the cross from Windows Phone - it shows new events from all contacts in social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People app will even let you call contacts' phones from the Lumia 2520. It uses Skype to make the call, which requires a subscription or Skype credits. The slate comes with a year worth of free Skype calls to sixty destinations worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter) and view your online albums.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Skype handles instant messaging duties<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the previous version, Windows 8.1 RT comes without a dedicated messenger app. Those duties are now handled by the Skype app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. Unfortunately, there is no haptic feedback (vibration) and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout is tailored for the 16:9 aspect of the Lumia's screen. The keyboard comes in two modes - standard and split screen, which divides the QWERTY in two halves, docked on either side of the screen with a number pad in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's handwriting recognition on Windows 8.1 RT. It works really well and, given the ample screen size, is very comfortable to use even with fingers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email app is divided into three screen panes. On the left you get the folder view, in the middle is the conversation view, while the currently selected email is displayed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up any account, including Hotmail, Google, Yahoo or your own. The app supports exchange activesync, IMAP and POP accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual messages and move them, mark as read or unread and even pin them to the start menu. You can send emails from whichever account you choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case, the "regular" email client is a tad too plain for you, Windows 8.1 RT has Outlook 2013 on board. Available in desktop only mode, it offers an old-school UI and an overwhelming amount of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up an email address on Outlook 2013 however is ridiculously easy. All you need to do is type in the email address and the password. The function works even with IMAP accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app handles, well, photos on Windows 8.1 RT. It's similar to what you'll find on Windows Phone, and comes with a clean, easy to navigate interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos app is divided into the Pictures library, SkyDrive, Flickr and Devices where you'll see the public photos shared by the people in your Homegroup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures in an album will be displayed in a side-scrollable horizontal grid. By default, pictures are displayed in large thumbnails but you can opt for a more compressed grid by pinching to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos in a slideshow or set the picture you're browsing as a lockscreen wallpaper, app tile or app background. Windows 8.1 RT also allows images to be opened in desktop mode. The latter includes Windows Photo Viewer, as well as the Paint editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark multiple photos in an album, which only lets you start a slideshow with them. You copy and cut pictures from the Photos app, as well as create new folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 is a decent device for browsing photos - the 10.6" screen is big enough and offers good colors and high resolution. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio of the screen doesn't get along too well with 4:3 photos, so you are getting lots of letterboxing or cropping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox is in charge of music and videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music and the video player of Windows 8.1 RT are handled by two separate apps powered by Xbox. Both are pinned to the Start menu once you power up the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xbox music has been significantly revamped compared to last version. It puts the user's own music collection, the music store, as well as an online radio under the same roof. A search bar tops all three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the Xbox music app takes the user to his/hers own music collection. Immediately below is the Xbox radio streaming service - it requires a premium pass for ad-free listening and looks like a good alternative to Pandora. The Xbox music store is now listed under an Explore section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now playing shows the artist and name of the song along with an overview with Album name, Genre, etc. The interface offers animated album art, pause/play and skip controls. A swipe from the top or bottom edge of the screen reveals the music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xbox Video greets you with featured movies and TV shows. User's own videos are all the way on the left. A search button can be found on the top right side. It works for both the user's content, as well as the one sold in the Xbox store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching videos on the Lumia 2520 is a real pleasure, thanks to the kickstand and 10.6" 1080p screen. The context menu offers repeat, previous, play/pause, next, and play to which lets you wirelessly stream the video to any DLNA-enabled device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Games is the place to go for downloading games on the Lumia 2520. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. Featured games will greet you at startup, in the same fashion as the video section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The store shows Windows games, divided into new releases and genres. Each game has its own page complete with an overview and the option to buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has improved a good deal in terms of available gaming titles for Windows 8.1 RT. Halo Spartan Assault is undoubtedly the most popular of the pack - it is exclusive to Windows devices for now (coming soon to Xbox 360 and Xbox One).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing a game on the Lumia 2520 is a breeze. The Snapdragon 800 chipset is top notch, so there were no issues whatsoever performance-wise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is passable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 put a rather uninspiring performance in our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the slate posted mostly great scores, but its frequency response left a lot to be desired. The volume levels were way below average, too, which is disappointing considering the available space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones doesn't introduce much distortion, but the stereo quality worsens and volume plunges even lower. Frequency response remains quite disappointing too for a pretty lackluster overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>6.7MP Carl Zeiss camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 features a 6.7MP main camera with a Carl Zeiss lens and a 2MP front-facing unit. The main camera is the same unit as the one in the Nokia Lumia 720 smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock camera UI is very simple. There are three buttons on the left side - one for taking photos, one for capturing video, and a third one for panoramas. Photos can also be captured by simply tapping on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up in the camera app reveals more options. They include changing the front and back camera, activating a timer, and adjusting exposure and focus. The camera roll access button is also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the stock camera app, Nokia has also added its own. Dubbed Nokia Camera, it allows users to switch the ratio of the images between 16:9 and 4:3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6.7MP multi-format camera sensor allows for taking 4:3 photos of roughly about 6.1MP and 16:9 photos in about 5.3MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality-wise the Lumia 2520 camera is quite a capable shooter for a tablet. The photos are pleasantly saturated and in good light they come out generally noise-free. Some of our camera samples did not turn out as sharp as we would have liked but that's only at 100% 1:1 view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first set of camera samples (4:3) are shot by the Nokia camera app. The app also allows shooting in 16:9 aspect ratio. It also has touch to focus as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Windows stock camera app, which shoots only in 16:9 aspect ratio. It also uses different settings for the image processing. Upon a closer inspection you will notice these shots have a different white balance setting (different as in worse) and they seem to have been processed with a higher contrast setting, which has limited the scene dynamic range captured by the camera for no obvious advantage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 captures 1080p videos with a bitrate of 19.6Mbps and 30fps. There is also stereo audio. Continuous auto focus during video recording is present, too. Sound is recorded in stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Camera app gives users the option to change the size of their videos. Full HD clips can be downsized to 720p, 480p, and 360p, all at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As seen on most Lumia smartphones, the video quality is really high. The videos come out smooth and rich in details. The only disadvantage is that there isn't any sort of video stabilization (not even digital) so handheld videos come out somewhat shaky (nothing out of the ordinary, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see a couple of samples we captured with the Nokia Lumia 2520 below. The first one is captured with the stock camera app, while the second one is a product of Nokia Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet explorer has two faces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows 8.1 RT comes with two browsers preinstalled and offers no other options for now. Delivered with the 8.1update, Internet Explorer 11 handles the web and comes in two forms - one in the Modern UI with a touch-centric interface and another one in the more conventional Desktop version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Modern view, IE 11 runs in full screen by default. A swipe from the bottom or top edge of the screen reveals the opened tabs on the bottom. It offers a new tab option, a new private tab, and reopen a closed one. At the bottom is a back button, the unified search/URL bar and options to refresh, pin the current page to start, forward and an extra menu with find on page, view on desktop and "get app for this site" options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing pages can be done via the Charms menu. Pages can be shared over Mail or the People app, meaning Facebook or Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, if you want to change preferences or settings you can only do so in desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 in desktop mode features a unified URL and search bar, the opened tabs and three virtual buttons for home, bookmark and settings. Opening up a new tab prompts a thumbnail collection of recently opened tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 is fully Flash-enabled. Watching videos inline is done exactly as you would on any desktop PC. We didn't experience any problems with videos even at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Options is well-known IE setting. You can set a home page, choose the level of security, privacy, control the intern content connections, etc. There's an option to open links directly from Internet Explorer in Modern or Desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer has come a long way and isn't the once clustered, slow browser many people used only for downloading Firefox and Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 did a phenomenal job in the JavaScript benchmark SunSpider. Its 517.5ms score is among the better ones we've seen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps, Windows Store, SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows 8.1 RT is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications for Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps come in two styles - aerial view and map view. In aerial, you get satellite imagery, which is pretty clear but there's no Bird's eye or Streetside options in the app, which we find particularly strange given their presence in the web version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout didn't make its way to Windows 8.1 RT - on Windows Phone it's the app that provides detailed information on places of interest around you - restaurants, shops, landmarks, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there is navigation available, it lacks voice guidance and we can't see many people using it as a daily tool. Traffic information is available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is the only place you can find apps for Windows 8.1 RT. Compared to last year, the number of available apps has grown significantly, thus improving one of the OS's weakest points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store starts off with featured apps. Swiping to the right reveals recommended apps, trending ones, and top picks. The last two sections show top paid and top free apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has gone through great lengths to address the lack of popular apps for Windows 8.1 RT. Compared to last year, there are a lot more of the popular app titles available here, including Dropbox, Flipboard, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some glaring omissions though. They include YouTube and alternative web browsers other than Internet Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Installing an app is easy - just go to the app and hit Install. You can check the download progress and a new tile being created in the start menu automatically. After an app has been installed you get a notification in the top right corner of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Windows Store shows a great improvement compared to the work in progress it was last year. We reckon that Microsoft can further help its cause by charging for the same available paid apps the same amounts Apple and Google do. On some occasions, the price differences were quite substantial.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive handles your personalization, app settings, passwords, language preferences, Office documents and much more. You can upload just about anything to SkyDrive and thus have it available across all of your Windows-powered handheld devices or PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app displays different categories for the uploaded content - Documents, Mobile uploads, camera roll, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can upload, create a folder or select multiple folders. You can upload multiple items at once. The upload menu gives you quick access to the most common apps from which users will upload - Photos, Desktop, Computer, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app shows photos from your SkyDrive account and Office has the feature to automatically save documents to the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, Windows 8.1 RT is doing very well to provide users with this easy back up option in case things go south and you need to reset your device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student Edition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed Office 2013 Home and Student edition gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Microsoft decided not to optimize the interface of either app to suit the Modern UI and instead just ported the x86 versions to the ARM platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't really blame them for doing so, as the office applications are bound to be used with a keyboard and a mouse/trackpad anyway. Plus, Office isn't the easiest of apps to master, which means that a general design overhaul might have put off frequent users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the functionality is there and, if you mainly use your PC for document editing, Windows 8.1 RT can easily pass as your daily driver. No matter whether you mean to create or edit documents, Windows 8.1 RT has got you covered. There's an easy to follow step by step tutorial for each Office application in case you're new to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Word 2013 features the entire package - text formatting, headings, track changes, page layout, you name it. Windows 8.1 RT has an impressively ample selection of fonts, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excel 2013 is there for your spreadsheet needs. Formulas and calculation are all supported, and so are cell formatting options. You'd be hard-pressed to find a difference between Excel on your PC and the one on Windows 8.1 RT.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating PowerPoint presentations on the Nokia Lumia 2520 is as easy as on PC. You can choose between countless transition effects, animations and sounds. A presentation can be previewed and imported, and an existing file can be edited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote 2013 is your one-stop app for taking and organizing notes on Windows 8.1 RT. The app has an interface similar to Word, but with less options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have multiple Notebooks in OneNote and creating one is done through a drop-down menu. You can choose the name of the Notebook and the color it shows up in, as well as whether to save it locally or in SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive can sync all of your Office 2013 documents between devices. All you need is your Microsoft ID. It's very convenient and sync is instantaneous. Your documents are safe in the cloud in case your PC needs a reset or is broken or lost.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app on Windows 8.1 RT is well familiar - it looks identical to the one on Windows Phone. You can set it to show events in Day, Week or Month view. There is no Agenda view so you cannot see a list of your upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Day and Week view are sorted by hours so you would need to scroll up or down, depending on the specific time of the event. Events are color coded depending on the type of calendar (your own, Birthdays, Holidays, etc.) and you can change colors to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting an event is simple and straightforward. Thanks to the large screen you see all of the information without the need for endless scrolling. The Calendar syncs with Hotmail, Google and Outlook. Facebook is strangely missing here so all of your Facebook buddies birthdays will need to be manually entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those users who have their mind on productivity can count on the superb organizing skulls of Outlook 2013. The app is only available in classic desktop mode like the rest of the Windows RT 8.1 office suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the organizing skills of Windows 8.1 RT have grown massively thanks to the presence of Outlook 2013. The latter was a glaring omission in the office suite of the OS's previous version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Deeply integrated Bing services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bing has seen a much deeper integration in Windows RT 8.1. Bing search is now accessed by a simple swiping gesture from the right side of the tablet's display. It gives you the option to search on the tablet alone, its settings, or the web. The latter can be specified for only images or videos. By default, Bing performs a search on both the tablet and online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing News shows you trending topics of the day from featured news sites. You can select to view content from a number of news sources, neatly organized by category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Articles appear in magazine-like style. You can choose between two different font styles, adjust the font size and toggle articles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Sport works the same way only it's focused on sporting news only. There's a spotlight with the story of the day, a top stories grid, the local sports schedule and, finally, the option to choose favorite teams you'd like to follow closely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an All Sports section which lets you choose a sport or league to check out but the choice is rather limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Finance is a mixture of financial news, stocks, currencies and commodities. You can create your own watch list of companies whose stock prices you like to keep track of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Travel is a great application filled with interesting facts, 360 degree panoramas of popular places around the world and a rich database covering many destinations around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app shows a featured destination on the main page each day, followed by a grid of the most popular destinations in the app. There's a nifty option to search for flights or hotels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Weather is the go-to app for daily forecasts. Opening up the app reveals the weather conditions in your current location (or a preset one) along with an hourly forecast, map view of temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, etc. in your region and nation-wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose to be informed for as many locations as you like. Finally there's a World Weather view, which offers information about major cities in the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia apps and service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In order to further distinguish its first tablet from the rest of the Windows RT gang, Nokia has added a number of exclusive apps to the Lumia 2520. They include Nokia Storyteller, Nokia Camera, My Nokia, and Nokia Video Director, and are grouped together on the Start screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Music is also preloaded on the slate, though it is available to download on other Windows RT tablets from the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Nokia allows users to register their Lumia 2520 and get access to tips, user manuals and support. An option to give the manufacturer feedback is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Nokia also allows users to sync their Nokia apps between different devices. This is an especially neat option if you own a Lumia smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Maps is one of the best mapping and location services available on any platform. It is also a significantly more capable option than the stock mapping solution powered by Bing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four different layers are available to view on HERE Maps. They include regular map, satellite, traffic, and public transportation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to explore too. Users can look at restaurants, hotels, theaters, shopping, and popular photography locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, direction services are also available. HERE Maps requires a Nokia account for obtaining access to the full array of available services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Storyteller groups your photos by date and location, thus marking events and places a user has experienced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be added or deleted from stories. The latter can also be favorite or renamed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Video Director offers similar functionality as the Storyteller app. It allows user to create unique videos by combining different clips together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different projects can be selected. Nokia has added several project templates. They include travel, birthday party, sports events, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Music is one of the most capable streaming services available. It allows users to create stations based on their interest, and enjoy ad-free music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can save songs for offline listening with a simple swiping gesture. Option to buy songs is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragons Adventure is a cool-looking 3D interactive game. It utilizes your actual location and changes it into a dragon-inhabited village.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The game offers rich graphics thanks to the tablet's powerful hardware. It is a nice time killer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 is a solid first entry into the tablet realm for the manufacturer, and a logical extension of its smartphone range. The slate is well-equipped, has instantly recognizable design, and, like Nokia's Windows Phone devices, comes with a number of useful, exclusive apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, like in the case of the Microsoft Surface 2, we are a bit skeptical about the choice of Windows 8.1 RT in the Nokia Lumia 2520. With Microsoft's own Surface 2 being the only other new product to utilize the OS besides the Lumia 2520, we can't help it but question the Windows RT's prospects as a viable competitor to the ever more tablet-friendly Android and iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, much like the Microsoft Surface 2 (analogies are difficult to avoid in this case), the Nokia Lumia 2520 should be judged depending on the user's specific perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The comparison is not in the Nokia Lumia 2520's favor when you face it with the likes of the iPad Air and the high-end Android tablet army. The Apple slate and the latest batch of flagship Android tablets offer more polished and better rounded tablet OS experience, though they cost significantly more when equipped with LTE radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above has nothing to do with hardware anymore, as, the slightly lower screen resolution aside, the Nokia Lumia 2520 is anything but short on specs. The operating system however, falls behind iOS and Android on the developers' priority lists. And as you know, mobile platforms these days are judged first by the number and quality of third-party apps available. In this respect, a Windowd 8 RT tablet such as the Lumia 2520 hardly has any strong point beyond the presence of the full-featured Microsoft Office suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest proper Windows 8 tablets (the ones with Intel Atom Bay Trail processors) also make a strong case against the Nokia Lumia 2520. LTE connectivity aside, the Atom-based tablets make more sense than Nokia's product by offering the full Windows experience at a lower price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of price, the Nokia Lumia 2520 is priced at $499 without contract for AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless in the United States. The optional battery keyboard cover will set you back an additional $149. LTE data plans on both carriers costs extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we took a look around about what else you can pick up for a similar budget as the Nokia Lumia 2520. Here are some of the most notable findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air is arguably the best full size tablet available at the moment. It offers higher screen resolution than the Surface 2, as well as superb design and ergonomics. To cap things off, Cupertino's entry offers close to half a million apps optimized for tablet use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The closest LTE iPad Air to the Nokia Lumia 2520 in terms of pricing would be the 16GB version at $629. If users are willing to skip the 4G connectivity and use their smartphone as a portable hotspot, $650 (the price of a Lumia 2520 with a keyboard cover) will buy them a 32GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air and a Bluetooth QWERTY keyboard case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) and the ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T are Android realm's heavy hitters at the moment. Both slates offer significantly higher-resolution displays when compared to the Surface 2, in addition to a better established tablet OS with a fine integration of Google's many services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) ? Asus Transformer Pad TF701T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A budget of $449 will get you a Wi-Fi-only version of the above two. LTE connectivity bumps up the price of the Note 10.1 significantly. In the case of the ASUS, it is missing as an option altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a host of Intel Bay Trail totting tablets, which offer full Windows 8.1 for less than what Nokia is asking for the Lumia 2520. The most notable ones include the ASUS Transformer Book T100 and the HP Omni 10, etc. All of them lack LTE, but cost $399 or less, thus leaving you plenty of spare change to pick up a wireless keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, considering the multi-faceted nature of the Nokia Lumia 2520, we decided to take a look at the Windows hybrid ultrabook realm even though it's outside of our usual area of interest. A quick search online brought up the MSI S Series ultrabook with 11.6" 1080p display, Inter Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, and a sliding keyboard listed for only $620 delivered - less than a Lumia 2520 with a battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The abovementioned ultrabook has no HSDPA/LTE connectivity, but if processing power in a portable package is what you are after, it literally blows the Nokia Lumia 2520 out of the water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Intel is expected to release a 22nm Atom chips with integrated LTE next year. They are bound to bring an even greater performance and power efficiency to the table, thus hopefully bringing an end to the Windows RT debacle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But back to the Lumia 2520. We are afraid that just like the first Nokia Lumia smartphones, the company's first tablet will not shatter any sales records either. But being the finest Windows RT offering and a logical extension to the Lumia range however, it is certain to attract its fair share of followers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until this moment arrives, or until Microsoft somehow shatters the wall separating the ARM-based tablets and the Windows Phone devices, the Nokia Lumia 2520 is bound to remain a characterful, but niche product. Like in the case of Windows Phone, it is up to Microsoft to make it a viable mainstream player, as Nokia has already done its job to squeeze the maximum out of the Windows RT platform.</paragraph>
