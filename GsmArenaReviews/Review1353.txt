			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With video gaming a sport in its own right, smartphones have no other choice but raise their game too. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play has strong ties to Sony?s gaming rigs, both portable and not, and Sony?s a big name in gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what does all this pedigree bring? Games from the original PlayStation for one, with PlayStation 2 titles coming in the near future. The PlayStation Pocket game store comes with 50 games at launch optimized for the Play. You?ll certainly also appreciate the familiar feeling and design of the gaming buttons. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let?s have a look at the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play. They stitched thumbs to the robot: meaning a DualShock controller stitched to a 4? touchscreen in a side-slider form factor. A smartphone version of the PSP Go but with more processing power isn?t far off the truth either. Especially now that the PSP Go is officially discontinued.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a quick summary of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the smartphone half of the XPERIA Play equation. It measures up pretty good as a droid and even though it can?t compete with the latest flagships, it?s got more than enough on its spec sheet for day to day use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile gaming is at an all time high. Everyone carries a phone around and everyone has gaps in their day to fill, making mobile games the time-killer of choice for millions of people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are usually simple games optimized for touchscreen input, usually with just one or two controls. But some want more compelling games and those require more elaborate controls. The XPERIA Play is the first phone in recent years that has the proper hardware controls. The added tactile feedback is a major plus. Android also seems as a nice software platform of choice for its potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are you ready for round one? You?ll have to complete the hardware inspection of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play to unlock the software.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the XPERIA Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play packs a compact charger, which couples with the microUSB cable (a long, solid-looking cable). You also get a one-piece headset and some manuals, plus the 8GB microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also had a carrying pouch in the box ? it?s sturdy and thick to protect your precious XPERIA Play. It?s not a luxury leather pouch but it?s pretty nice nonetheless (keep in mind that it might be a region specific accessory).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY stands at 119 x 62 x 16mm ? smaller than its PSP Go counterpart despite the bigger screen (the PLAY has a 4? screen vs. the 3.8 inches of the Go) but bigger than most phones, even those that come with a full hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display and dedicated gaming controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play was made with comfortable two-handed use in mind. It?s thick and heavy as a phone. The back and the corners are tapered ? when you hold it landscape with both hands, it fits like a glove but otherwise it?s quite big to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play weighs in at 175 grams, which certainly is heavy for single-handed use. All that weight is well balanced though for a firm and comfortable grip when held in both hands during play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s first look at the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play as a gaming device ? examining the screen and game controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson decided against using their Bravia Engine based Reality display. Instead, they put a 4? 16M-color FWVGA (480 x 854) LCD screen on the XPERIA Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is quite good to view straight on, with good contrast and color rendering. It?s not very bright though even at the brightest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are not that great ? at an angle high-contrast things (like black text on a light background) remain visible but colors get washed out and contrast degrades pretty fast, making gradients appear as a solid color. IPS LCD or AMOLED displays don?t have this viewing angle issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the game control deck, the slider mechanism is spring-assisted and quite smooth. It locks firmly in place, keeping both halves of the phone very stable in fully open position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The deck has a set of dedicated gaming buttons modeled after the DualShock controller for the PlayStation console.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four types of controls. The directional keys are on the left and the action keys are on the right. They are placed into two recessed circles ? that means the keys don?t catch against the slider, but they bulge out enough and have a good solid click. Those keys are very easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two analog touch pads, which stand in for the analog sticks of a DualShock controller. Those aren?t all that big and you might not get all the precision you want out of them, especially if you have big fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L and R trigger keys are on the top side of the phone (when held horizontally). They are big, perfectly positioned under your forefingers and overall very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a standard set of game controls too ? Start and Select, along with a handy Menu key (which is a shortcut to the game settings). These keys are small and out of the way, so you won?t hit them accidentally during play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play isn't the smallest phone around but, again, comfortable hold during gaming was the designers? top objective. A solid grip is essential to good gaming experience, especially since you have your index fingers and thumbs moving around quickly on the control deck and behind the screen on the shoulder keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only wish the back was made of something grippier than glossy black plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the phone is more comfortable to hold horizontally in two hands than with one hand up to your ear. One-handed use isn't hard by any means, it just takes some getting used to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play has recognizable Sony Ericson styling, sharing a lot with phones like the Neo and the Pro. The rounded top and bottom and the curved back are especially recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve already covered the display, so let?s go over what?s around it. Below is the standard set of Android keys: Back, Home, Menu and Search. The keys have a solid press but they might be difficult to tell apart just by feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is business as usual too. There?s the earpiece at the center and the video call camera to the left of it. To the right are the proximity sensor and the ambient light sensor grouped together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play features the L and R trigger keys and the volume rocker. The rocker is pretty thin and its central positioning makes it hard to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Play, there?s the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port, both of which are exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is on top ? it?s small and impossible to hit accidentally. The key has a small dot of a charging LED. The bottom features just the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the curved back of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play there?s the 5MP camera lens and the LED flash. The camera is unprotected but it?s been a while since we?ve seen a phone with an actual lens cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things of interest at the back are the stereo loudspeakers ? set right on the tapered edge to make sure the sound doesn?t get muffled. The secondary microphone is also there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the back cover automatically unmounts the memory card so you can remove it safely. The case opening trip wire is a tiny detector, which is quite sensitive. If you haven?t fit the back cover firmly on, the XPERIA Play will keep unmounting and mounting the memory card, which can be terribly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play comes with an 8GB microSD card in the box but you can put in cards as big as 32GB in the slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is under the 1500mAh battery. The battery is quoted at over 400 hours of standby time and 8h and 6h of talk time in 2G and 3G respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware-wise the XPERIA Play is a balanced device. Its design serves one purpose- landscape gaming ? and it?s great at it. We wouldn?t go as far as calling it overweight but one thing?s for sure, the Play is quite thick and it?s a harsh contrast to pretty much all high-end Android phones (except for the XPERIA Neo, if it counts in that league).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread with custom touches<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year the Sony Ericsson droids are finally up to speed with the current crop of Android smartphones, software-wise, at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is the third Gingerbread-powered smartphone in the Sony Ericsson lineup along with the Arc and the Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mediascape add-on, used in last year?s lineup is gone and in comes the customized Gingerbread UI. The Timescape UI is still here though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video of the XPERIA Play UI in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added its own tweaks and customizations to the Gingerbread interface. There?re no drastic changes though, the user interface just got a little polished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to five homescreen panes to populate with widgets. If you pinch to zoom out on any of them you get an overview of all your widgets currently in use. It?s a neat feature many manufacturers use. The difference here is you don?t get a number of mini homescreens but a single screen bringing all widgets together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added a custom PlayStation Pocket widget that leads to your PlayStation games and lets you buy more. But more on this in the relevant chapter of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pull-down notification area is a trademark Android feature. The Sony Ericsson version displays recent events, running apps, active connections and downloads, but doesn?t offer quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes. Truth be told though, there?re dedicated widgets for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On either side of the launcher key there are two docked icons visible across all homescreen panes. They can be edited to either display a single icon or a folder containing multiple items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders on the XPERIA Play is easy and intuitive, quite iPhone-esque really. Just drag one icon over another and a popup will appear with the folder options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the launcher (main menu) you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most droids out there, the XPERIA Play offers live wallpapers, along with the regular ones. The live wallpaper gallery features the usual selection, with one special exclusive to the Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a lot user friendlier with Android Gingerbread. You get two large pointers which can be dragged to make a selection. After this you?re good to go with copy, paste and cut.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of benchmarks, the XPERIA Play is in no way a revelation. It does okay and would?ve been great a year ago. But on the ever-evolving smartphone market it?s dual-core or bust if you want to look good in synthetic benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play runs on a 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8255 processor with Adreno 205 graphics chip. The amount of RAM is 512 MB, out of which 380 MB available are user-available, while the rest are reserved by the OS, most probably for the GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.3 Gingerbread does help the overall speed and fluidity of the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We reran every benchmark we did previously for our pre-production preview and our retail unit used for this review did just slightly better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the meanest of droids that came by our office lately, the XPERIA Play fails to impress. But there isn?t much point comparing it to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic benchmarks aside, the XPERIA Play is a decent performer in real life. The UI runs smooth and there aren?t any lags even with multiple running applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Play is slower than a dual-core device but you won?t notice this in daily use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the most important part of the XPERIA Play?s performance ? it does pretty well at gaming too. There wasn?t a single game out of the preinstalled bunch that the phone seemed to struggle with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook hasn?t changed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play has a good phonebook with practically unlimited storage for your contacts. Plus, it?s good-looking and user friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very top you have a search box to quickly find a specific contact. There?s an alphabet scroll too for fast browsing by first letter and at the bottom you get shortcuts to the dialer, call log and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact is added in more than one account, you can merge their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled too ? by tapping a contact?s photo you get shortcuts for calling, texting or email options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also ?star? a contact, which automatically adds it to your Favorites. Those ?starred? contacts appear in the Gmail app too, under ?Starred in Android?, so you can quickly email them, without the need to add them as a separate contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony short of smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play is a phone as well (shocker!) and it does well in that department. It had no troubles holding onto signal and in-call sound was consistently good. There?s a secondary microphone on the back for active noise-cancellation. Ambient noise gets filtered and the person on the other end can hear you much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The letdown in Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is the lack of smart dialing ? hardly acceptable for a high-end droid. Voice dialing ? with a dedicated homescreen widget ? is little consolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play has a proximity sensor above the display to turn the screen off during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the XPERIA Play. It got a good mark and the stereo speakers help out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the messaging department, Android values simplicity in design and the XPERIA Play is the usual impressive performer. All text communication is laid out into threads, the latest message at the bottom. You can lock messages against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search in every conversation to help you quickly find a specific message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick Contacts works here too, but only in separate messages. Delivery reports can be activated, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text box can only show three lines at a time and composing longer messages can be a little frustrating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an MMS is very simple. Just hit the add button next to the writing box and add an element like a picture, sound, video or you can even take a photo and add it simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input options on the Play boil down to the propriety Gingerbread QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that it?s bad, not at all, with well spaced and reasonably sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery looks good but downsizes images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play uses the traditional droid Gallery, with solid functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects. What we don?t quite like is that it only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online web albums uploaded over at Picasa, those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the XPERIA Play?s multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from the device over email, the full-res shot is received on the other end. We guess it?s done to speed up performance and cut loading times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the XPERIA Play as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, don?t get your hopes too high on this one either as the player supports only 3GP and MP4 ? no DivX and XviD support on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you take the time to convert your videos beforehand though, the Play does make for a good video player with its ample 4? screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you could just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player interface on the XPERIA Play is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting around is easy ? and the UI is good looking too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers all the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key, which lets you quickly look up a song or album on YouTube or Sony Ericsson?s own Play Now Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play has a rich selection of equalizer presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play did very well in our audio quality test. The frequency response of the smartphone is perfect with no headphones attached and still easily within the golden +- 1dB deviation limit with headphones on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem we had with it is the stereo crosstalk, which spikes intensly when you plug in a pair of headphones. The distortion levels increase too in that scenario, but they still remain tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings are all great - the noise levels and dynamic range scores are among the best we have seen. With an active external amplifier you are also getting some pretty low distortions and stereo-crosstalk readings. Plus the XPERIA Play is reasonably loud so it's a very decent performance overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play has a 5 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED flash. It produces images of 2592&#x445;1944 resolution and offers image stabilization and geotagging. It turns out that the XPERIA Play doesn?t really offer the touch focus we thought it would so you can scratch it off your feature list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no dedicated shutter key on the XPERIA Play ? the space is used up by the trigger. Some other gaming controls work in camera mode though. The X button serves as a shutter key and the O button is a back key. The menu key brings up the relevant options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main set of options is limited to focusing mode, exposure, scene mode, color effect and picture size. ISO, for example isn?t among the available user-configurable options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the XPERIA Play camera is not the best 5 megapixel camera we've seen but it isn?t half bad either. It doesn't resolve as much detail as the best of business, but colors and contrast are fine and noise is kept to reasonable levels. If you are not pixel-peeping and you?d use your shots without any cropping, the XPERIA Play offers a generally nice camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play does seem to offer a good macro focusing mode. Check out the flower images above.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording maxes out at WVGA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play maxes out at WVGA video at 30 fps. Most high-end smartphones offer at least 720p nowadays, some even probing Full HD video. The XPERIA Play seems to disagree though. Gaming is the key here and it seems WVGA video is enough for this droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 03.08.11: Sony Ericsson released a software update that enables stereo sound when recording videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 25.10.11: The Xperia play now offers 720p video recodring with continuous autofocus thanks to an update from Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The somewhat low detail aside, the XPERIA Play videos are smooth enough, with good colors. The video camera interface repeats the still camera. It?s pretty basic but gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a WVGA video sample taken straight from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched video sample for download.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play comes with a standard set of connectivity options: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and HSUPA at 5.76 Mbps for upload speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) with DLNA support USB v2.0 and Bluetooth 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage is 400MB only, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone ships with an 8GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no HDMI port on the XPERIA Play. This certainly is one of the phones where this feature would?ve made sense ? and we won?t even get into HDMI mirroring.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web-browser with Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Complete with the added Flash 10.2 support, the Gingerbread browser on the XPERIA Play can easily put the entire World Wide Web in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much non-existent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back). That way you have the entire screen for web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. A last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the big updates of the XPERIA Play?s (or any other Gingerbread phone) web browser is the full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.2 player. YouTube videos played quite smoothly (360p-480p), and so did the games from Kongregate, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High-res videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like its bigger brother ? the Arc ? the XPERIA Play comes with a slid set of organizing options preinstalled, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app handled all manner of office extensions hassle-free and viewing a word or PDF file on the Play is comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching all kinds of files is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big and thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. Unfortunately, you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the Android Market can make up for whatever organizing skills the XPERIA Play lacks. And they?re all free so don?t despair ? it only takes a few minutes to fill the gaps in the organizing department.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc comes with a GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in just under a minute with the A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the main application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on, it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel. Or go to the Android Market and pick up a dedicated navigation app, which would get the job done for your region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our XPERIA Play came with Maps 5.0 preinstalled, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on. It borrows from the Google Earth app and it?s really cool with all the features and effects combined.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play runs the latest version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way. But many apps are duplicated in the market and many are just plain unusable for you, so keep an eye only on the ones you like or need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>At the Arcade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play launched this mounth in many contries and as promised Sony Ericsson delivered more than 50 games for it. Now these aren?t new games, most of them anyway, they?re optimized for the special Play controls. PS1 games are pretty limited so far and are region-specific. Currently they are under 10 overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This isn?t all bad though, because PS1 games are bound to find their way to the Play officially eventually and the current Android ones aren?t necessarily worse than the original PlayStation titles. Some of them may even be better. For example Backstab HD was launched exclusively for the XPERIA Play and it?s a great game with solid graphics and gameplay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first game we found preinstalled on the Play is Crash Bandicoot. Being an original Playstation 1 title, it?s displayed in the PlayStation widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes use of all of the hardware controls and is a good way to get a taste of the promised PlayStation experience on the XPERIA Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next title is Bruce Lee: Dragon Warrior, probably an XPERIA Play-exclusive game, which we couldn?t find at the Android Market. This game however is also available for Bada OS and iOS (including an HD version for the iPad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Star Battalion you are a space craft pilot on missions against land and air targets. It, too, makes use of the hardware controls of the XPERIA Play, even the left and right pads and the virtual control sticks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sports genre is represented by FIFA 10. Having played it on the iPhone and Android handsets, comparison is overwhelmingly in the XPERIA Play?s favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While playing around with the Play we installed the PSX4Droid emulator, which is currently being downloaded free, courtesy of its creator, developer ZodTTD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PSX4Droid enables you to port PlayStation 1 games on Android and iOS devices. It?s a great emulator and we tested a title, probably known to all console fans ? The King of Fighters. It?s a Street Fighter type of a game with a unique, for its time anyway, game-playing style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was really cool to enjoy this game on a mobile phone. Sure it?s like at the arcade but it was still impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls of the XPERIA Play made a huge difference and we?re very easy to set up. The game, naturally, didn?t lag at all and there were no crashes whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is just a preview of what could potentially be a gaming revolution for Android if we see more ?PlayStation-certified? devices. When Sony Ericsson eventually port enough games from the original PlayStation 1 to the Play gaming enthusiast will have a huge amount of titles to choose from. This could, potentially tip the scales from iOS to Android?s favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video of playing a PS1 game on the XPERIA Play.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s get one thing straight here. The XPERIA Play is a gaming droid and you shouldn?t get hung up on the less than stellar video and single-core-only CPU. It wasn?t meant to be the flagship in the XPERIA lineup ? it?s up to the Arc to shoulder the responsibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And come to think of it, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is one of the easiest phones to recommend. Whether you?re a die-hard PlayStation buff or just after a fun-to-own smartphone, the Play should be on your list. Want a phone to play games on? Be my guest. They don?t get any better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But life is never this simple. If you?re paying so much you might as well want your phone to do other things too. The Play is half smartphone, half-PSP Go and it?s got the gamepad to prove it. It?s exactly the gamepad though that you need to be absolutely sure about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we mean it. No second thoughts allowed. Otherwise you may never make up your mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play sure costs a pretty penny and most of the price is down to the unique game control deck. The moment you start wondering what else you can buy for this kind of money, things start to look bad for the PlayStation phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Want a bigger and better screen? The XPERIA Arc?s Reality display will do. Dual-core processor anyone ? there?s enough on offer already by most leading manufacturers. 8-megapixel still imaging or full HD video are no less exciting than PlayStation gaming. And if you?re into tweaking you can get the PSX4Droid emulator for free and play virtually the same titles as on the XPERIA Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    SE XPERIA Arc ? Moto ATRIX ? LG Optimus 2x ? Samsung Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not least ? you won?t be playing games 24/7. Or so we hope at least. But the extra weight and width will be there regardless. The XPERIA Play is just not the most comfortable of gadgets to use as an everyday phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we guess we shouldn?t be treating the XPERIA Play as just another phone. The unique gamepad puts it in a league of its own ? and in a place that?s pretty much safe from competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing for Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play to worry about is filling up its game store with exclusive content ? and quick. But even if it fails in that it, will have accomplished something. For one, it proves people wrong who thought the gamephone went extinct with N-gage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, it?s the first thing in a long time to really question touchscreen as the only direction worth heading towards. And who knows ? if the industry has caught the gaming bug for real, the next thing to expect is perhaps a better second try at motion based gaming (we?re looking at you Sony Ericsson Yari).</paragraph>
