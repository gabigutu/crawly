			<paragraph>In the end of last year Samsung announced their UMTS slim clamshell Z540. This review comes quite late, but yet we decided to publish one since the 3G black beauty is still an attractive proposition. The impressive display in a thin UMTS clamshell combined with a 1.3 megapixel camera makes the mobile quite an interesting market contender.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z540 falls in a very large market niche. The phone has 3G UMTS support, a QVGA display and a 1.3 megapixel camera. In addition, Z540 is supplied with 140 MB internal memory and provides MP3 player features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A somewhat RAZR design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of Z540 is very nice. It's very precise and plain and makes the phone look elegant. The black surface and the indented lines in the plates make it look a little rough but not crude. The phone feels very comfortable when held in hand both when opened and closed. When it's opened, it is very easy to use and the weight balance is perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    From all sides, closed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom of the front cover are located two loud speaker grills. Just above them are the music control buttons. The frame with the SAMSUNG sign and the outer display is above them. And in the top end we find the camera lens. The back panel is far simpler. It has only four rubber taps in every corner and the battery cover in the lower part of it. The top side of the closed device accommodates a neck-strip hole. On the left side is the two-way volume control button. On the opposite right side are located the camera release button and the USB port, which is protected by a plastic cap. The secondary camera for video calls is situated in the swivel joint of the clamshell construction in the middle of the phone. When the phone is opened, the camera is on the right side of the joint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Front ? back ? system connector</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When opened Z540 looks very nice and the keypad leaves very good impressions in terms of design. The phone, however, feels a bit rough and narrow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Almost perfect construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The construction of the Z540 clamshell seems very stable and solid. The solid feeling is assisted by the metal or metal-like plastic that the phone is made of. It feels very cool and strong in one's hand. The dimensions of the phone are 99x50.5x14.9 mm. The opening mechanism works fine and the phone can be opened using one hand only. The device didn't produce any creak sounds neither showed any loosening in the construction except for the battery cover. It plays and creaks a little. The arresting mechanism of the cover doesn't seem to work properly and cover loosens. Otherwise, the construction is done perfectly. The location of the side buttons seems comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Comparison with Motorola E1070, which has almost the same features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone doesn't catch fingerprints easily. Only the outer display is prone to that. The matt material of the front and back cover does not catch any fingerprints at all which is great. Dust is a bigger problem, though. It collects between the upper and lower part of the phone in the clamshell swivel joint. Those parts should be wiped once in a while in order to keep the phone clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Z540 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is easily opened. Underneath it is the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery. The SIM card bed in right next to the battery but you cannot slide in or out the SIM card without first removing the battery. There is no memory card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Absolutely flat keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the phone is almost absolutely flat but is still easy to use and you can easily distinguish the different buttons. Only the four-way control key is a pickle as the confirm button can be easily mistaken with one of the four directional hotspots on the key. The structure of the keypad features the usual numeric keys in its lower part. Above them is a row accommodating the red and the green call keys and the correction C button between them. The four-way control button is above them in the middle, surrounded by the Quick Switch button on the left and a system application fixed button on the right. Two soft keys are located at the very top of the keypad. If you haven't used a flat keyboard before, you should try writing a test SMS - not everyone gets used to such keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The flat keyboard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keypad is rather poor though. It glows in white, the backlight is even, but doesn't seem to be enough. The buttons remain hardly visible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: the strongest link<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The outer display of the phone is a TFT one and has a 128 x 128 pixels resolution. It boasts 64K colors. In standby mode it shows the network coverage, the current ringing profile, the battery status and the time. You may also set it to show an analog clock, custom text or a wallpaper. The display shows the image that will be captured when you are making a self-portrait. When you are using the music player, the display shows information about the current song. Sadly, the outer display is hardly legible in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Outer display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main attraction, however, is the main display. The 256K colors QVGA display is very good. It's large enough and the colors are very vivid. Even in direct sunlight, the display stays very clear and legible. The backlighting of the display is very good, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reception quality is very good and the sound during calls is nice too. The battery life is not bad for such a slim phone; of course, if you want longer battery cycles, you should use it in GSM-only mode. The sound quality and the loudness of the main speaker are good enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Z540 has a standard Samsung user interface. The main menu consists of a matrix grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. When selected the icons are zoomed and animated. The sub-menus in the phone are shown in listed view only. Every application works fast, except for the camera one but we'll get to that later. Samsung deserve compliments for the fast performance of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Main display ? main menu ? sub-menu ? profiles ? Quick Switch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has approximately 150 MB internal memory and that seems enough for about two full music albums. The memory is shared thus it's used for music, videos, games, messages, etc. Regrettably, there are no graphic themes available. However, you may change the font size and the style of the digits when you enter a number. There are several options, some of which are quite interesting.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ordinary phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in Z540 seems very simple and easy to use. The maximum capacity is 1000 contact names and it orders them either by first or by last name. However, when you search through them, it searches only by first or last name, in accordance to the order setting. You won't be able to search by a first name if you have set the phone to order the contacts by last name, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays up to 3 contact names en bloc. Only the default number of the contact is shown and in order to see the other (if any) numbers you should get into the contact's information. When adding a new contact the phone offers many fields and you can add up to five different phone numbers. However, if you add a birthday date of a contact, it is not transferred in the calendar. There are separate groups of fields for every contact in the phonebook but there is no ringtone assignment option. Different contacts can be assigned ringtones and pictures through the File Manager by its "Set as Caller ID" function.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same old call records<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The call records part of the phone is divided in four sub-folders. The Current contacts, where are gathered the recent dialed, received and missed calls. There are also the Missed calls, Dialed and Received calls folders with 30 records each. In all four folders there is an option which shows the amount of times you have called or received a call from the same contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Call log</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor of the phone seems very practical and easy to use. It displays a counter of the characters left and starts the countdown from 1836 characters. It also shows the amount of separate messages that will be sent if you exceed 160 characters. Of course, there is a T9 dictionary to assist fast writing. Email messages cannot exceed the 1000 characters maximum capacity. There are two separate inboxes for the emails and the other messages. When you read a message it is displayed in 7 lines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Media player with graphic visualizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media player of the Samsung Z540 seems nice and has an interesting graphic visualization feature. The sound of the stereo speakers is very loud but not so clear. There is no full screen option in the player. The supported file formats are MP3, ACC, WMA and ACC+. It also supports Playlists and ID3 tags which is a good thing. Headphones can be connected via the USB port. The external music control buttons come very handy when running the player in background with the device closed. Of course, the usability of the device as a MP3 player is limited, because of the lack of memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A slow camera?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera has various features and effects but lacks flash, macro and night mode. You can zoom the picture by using the UP and DOWN directions of the four-way control key. The LEFT and RIGHT direction keys adjust the white balance. With "1" key you toggle between camera and video mode. "2" is for toggling among the available resolutions, "3" is for changing capture quality, "4" is for multi shot sequence capturing (up to 12 pictures), "5" puts various light effects, "7" shows frames and other picture effects, "8" is for the self-portrait timer and "0" gets you to the Images folder. When you press the "#" button you switch between full screen and windowed mode. There is no full screen option in video mode. When you use the Viewfinder in the windowed (default) mode, you cannot see the left and right edges of the picture. The two-way volume button changes the orientation of the camera lens. The DOWN way works as a mirror as it flips the picture view mirror-like. The UP way flips the picture upside down. There is a second video call camera, just below the main display, which can be used for also taking self portraits, but the quality is low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera settings </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface works rather slow and irritating. Also there is a significant delay between the press of the shutter and the actual capture of the picture. Taking photos of moving objects is nearly impossible. A good thing is that noise levels are relatively low even in poor light conditions. Sometimes the colors are slightly off, otherwise the picture quality is average for a 1.3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Samsung Z540 photo samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can record video clips in QCIF resolution (176 x 144 pixels). The digital zoom can be used during the record, but it results in annoying delays in the clips.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UMTS connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features UMTS and EDGE which makes it an ordinary 3G device capable of fast data transfers. Other connectivity options are Bluetooth and USB. The USB may only be used with a custom data cable. The Bluetooth connection works seamlessly. PC synchronization was a piece of cake using Bluetooth. Regrettably, there is no Infrared connectivity feature which makes connecting with older mobiles and other devices more difficult.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The browser fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of the phone has many options and features but even when set to use the smallest font size available it couldn't accommodate much information on the QVGA screen. There is a URL remembering feature which helps the user when typing an address. There seems to be a memory problem with the browser as it says the memory is low and cannot load all the images when trying to open larger pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Sasmung Z540 web browser</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Running on schedule<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Organizer sub-menu of the phone consists of several applications: Calendar, Week view, Today's events, Schedule, Anniversary, Task, Memo, Missed event alarm. The Calendar application has both month and week view as the week view is the same feature as the Week view in the Organizer sub-menu. The Anniversary application is very useful and comes handy for adding birthday dates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar month and week view</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handy tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are few applications that we haven't mentioned above and are supplied in the phone. Those are the Voice memo, World clock, Calculator, Converter. The Voice memo application is a simple voice recorder with 5 minutes limit. The Calculator is very simple and lacks more sophisticated features. The Converter is for Currency, Length, Weight, Volume, Area and Temperature conversions. Also, there is the File Manager which organizes all the files in the phone. Regrettably, it lacks multi selection feature.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Now for the time wasting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only two preinstalled games in our Z540 version and they're both not very amusing. Power In Line X is a very lame roller skate simulation which is irritating rather than entertaining. The second game is The Last Age which is a first person sci-fi robot action. The control of the game is confusing and the gameplay is also not very well elaborated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Entertainment menu ? Power In Line X ? The Last Age</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A diamond with flaws<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Z540 surely has some great features and very good hardware characteristics. The stylish design, good display and camera, music features and fast interface puts it in really good position for the customers. However, the lack of memory card slot and Infrared, the slow camera response and the confusing navigation button are significant drawbacks for the model. Anyway, we are sure that if you really like the style of this phone, you won't be put off by its flaws.</paragraph>
