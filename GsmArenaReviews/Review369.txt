			<subsectionTitle>3GSM World Congress 2007<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona ended on February 15-th after gathering an estimated total of 55,000 people (10% more than last year) from all over the world at a showcase of the latest and greatest in the mobile communications industry. More than 1,300 exhibitors took part in the event, organized by the GSM Association. Over 2,250 media representatives plunged into the action and reported live straight from the source. The Barcelona authorities and public transport managed with a remarkable ease to host a wide-scale event as the 3GSM Congress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several mobile handset awards were given this year. The "Best GSM Mobile Handset or Device" title went to the Samsung D900 while the two "Best 3GSM Mobile Handset or Device" awards went to the Sony Ericsson K800 and the Samsung Z560. The Motorola MOTOFONE 3 snatched the new "Best Ultra Low Cost Handset" award for its innovative design and technology. The 3GSM World Congress 2008 will be held again in Barcelona next year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Barcelona<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Barcelona is the capital city of Catalonia region in Spain. The city is located along the Mediterranean coast, south of the Pyrenees. The population of the metropolis is near 4.6 (the city alone - 1.6) million people. Barcelona is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, due to its good climate and its cultural offerings. Barcelona citizens have a certain hunch for sports - the city hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics and it's also very popular with its football team FC Barcelona.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia stand at the 3GSM 2007 held in Fira de Barcelona was a nice place where you can have a go at all their most recent mobiles. This week we saw the Nokia E90 Communicator, the Nokia E65 - a smart slider, Nokia E61i - an improved messanger, Nokia N77 - a mobile TV receiver, the Nokia 6110 Navigator - a GPS slider and finally the Nokia 3110 classic - which as the name implies is a plain vanilla S40 mobile phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E90 Communicator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The highlight over at Nokia camp is without a doubt the Nokia E90 Communicator itself. Highly awaited, the Nokia E90 is the Nokia's new shot at communicators - a theme that was left aside for quite some time now. The new Nokia E90 is based on the Symbian 9.1 OS with the 3rd generation of S60 user interface as all recent Nokia smartphones do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Nokia E90</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E90 features more or less all current connectivity technologies such as quad-band GSM/EDGE/GPRS, UMTS, HSDPA, Wi-Fi, miniUSB, Bluetooth 2.0 and Infrared port. The external 16M colors display has a QVGA resolution, while the internal PDA display has a resolution of 800x352 pixels and features 16 million colors as well. In these days imaging is just as important as everything else and the Nokia E90 Communicator doesn't fail to impress with a 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera. The communicator also boasts a FM radio and a microSD memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Nokia E90</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One word can describe it actually - a stylish business tool. Well the words turned out to be three but rest assured the emphasis is on "stylish". The E90 is just impressive? The fine details matter here. We at GSMArena have never been fond of large multifunctional devices that are just begging "c'mon, go buy yourself a laptop" but as it turned out our time alone with the E90 Communicator allowed it to win our hearts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E90</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the fact that it looks rather large, it is actually really comfortable to work with and to carry in your hand. It reacts fast to user input and both the QWERTY keyboard and the alphanumeric keys score high on user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E90</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Browsing like on a PC ? Taking pictures ? Using GPS maps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E90 would start shipping in Q2 of 2007 but would have wider availability in Q3 2007 and will be sold at an expected price of 750-800EUR.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6110 Navigator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6110 Navigator is the next Nokia smartphone we had a chance to see. The model designation is somewhat a reminiscence of the highly successful mobile handset in the past - the Nokia 6110. But let us tell you, the two devices have nothing in common whatsoever. It just seems that Nokia are starting to recycle their model numbers. Complete with Nokia Navigator application, 3G and HSDPA support, the Nokia 6110 Navigator is a complete navigation solution which adds a nice variety to the Finnish portfolio. The Nokia 6110 Navigator also boasts a 16M colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution, a 2 megapixel camera and can capture video in QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                Nokia 6110 Navigator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated Nokia 6110 Navigator application is developed in cooperation with Route 66 and uses Navteq maps. The Nokia 6110 Navigator is a nice slider and feels comfortable when held in hand. The keypad and the navigation keys are rather user-friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E65<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next highlight from the Nokia portfolio is without a doubt the Nokia E65. A stylish slider, with serious equipment including quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and UMTS support, Wi-Fi, 2 megapixel camera and a 16M colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Nokia E65</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E65 managed to surprise us with its slimness because it is a really thin smartphone. It has a rather stiff slide spring. It has a great display and the plastic the body is made of seems of good quality. The back panel is again plastic but is styled so that it imitates leather and it does very well at that. The overall impression is that the Nokia E65 is a really nice and stylish smartphone that would easily find a lot of fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E65</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 is already available in selected markets but wider availability is expected in the first quarter of 2007 at an estimated retail price of 400EUR.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E61i<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia also announced an upgraded version of their highly successful QWERTY messenger the Nokia E61. The new Nokia E61i is now camera enhanced - the 2 megapixel lens now crowns the back of the device. Other changes are really minor - the most important being that the memory card slot is now a microSD one instead miniSD. Nokia E61i will hit the shelves in Q2 of 2007 at an estimated price of again 400EUR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Noka E61i</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N77<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N77 focuses on the DVB-H technology which is beginning to gain popularity. Based on the design of Nokia N73, the Nokia N77 has stereo Bluetooth support, microSD memory card slot, a 2 megapixel camera and 3G support with video calls. The centralpiece of the Nokia N77 is without a doubt its large 2.4" 16M colors TFT display. The Nokia N77 will be commercially available in Q2 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Nokia N77</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N77 is comfortable handset and it works really fast. The device really looks like Nokia N73 but it has a different keypad. The N77 tunes to the DVB-H station at easy and it buffers 30 seconds of the streamed content, so if you happen to distract for a second and miss that football goal you can still rewind and enjoy it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3110 classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So much for smart devices, many people still look for regular mobiles with classic design and characteristics. Based on the Series 40 user interface, the Nokia 3110 classic is the new lower midrange offer of the manufacturer and again it uses the name of a rather older mobile that is long forgotten - the Nokia 3110. It will feature a 1.3 megapixel camera, a stereo FM radio, Bluetooth, Infrared and tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 3110 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3110 has a comfortable keypad and a nice form factor so there is a certain chance it would get popular if it's not overpriced as most of the devices that come out under the S40 user interface do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N95<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next two smartphones are not newly announced but it was our first chance to get a hands-on experience with them. The Nokia N95 slider is a really interesting device - complete with an integrated HSDPA, GPS receiver, Wi-Fi, TV-out port and a 5 megapixel camera it really looks impressive on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powered by the latest Symbian 9.2 OS, the first impression you get of the N95 is that it looks a lot like the Nokia N80 slider. It's slightly bigger though but that's inevitable. We did got to play with it for a while and we are more than happy with its performance. Unlike the Nokia 6110 Navigator it works with the Nokia Maps application. What it does is that it downloads the map you need interactively during GPS positioning. It also has assisted positioning using the mobile data transfer channels available so it should work faster than competing solutions. The interesting thing about the Nokia Maps application is that you don't buy the maps themselves - they are free to download, but you pay for the routing. The application uses voice-assisted routing for in car use and you have to pay for that service. That is the reason you pay on a time basis - a one week license, a month license, etc. Again, unlike the Nokia 6110 Navigator application, the Nokia Maps uses Tele Atlas maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Demonstration of Nokia N95 Maps application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                  Nokia N95</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera also performs great in terms of speed and auto focus capability. We cannot judge the picture quality yet since the camera software it uses is not a final version, but we are more than happy to present you with a few quick snaps we took plus an actual official N95 camera sample. Bear in mind though that it's made by a professional photographer in a controlled environment so you cannot judge camera quality based solely on that.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N76<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other Nokia smartphone we got our hands on is the multimedia-oriented Nokia N76 clamshell.It is a 3G-device, equipped with a large 2.4" 16M colors main diplay with a QVGA resolution, a 2 megapixel camera, a 3.5 mm audio jack and external dedicated multimedia keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>          Nokia N76</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shinier and bigger than ever we did find the design rather controversial. The design is indeed user-friendly, but it's too "bling-bling" for our taste. The shiny body is a real fingerprint magnet. When it comes to user-friendliness, the N76 manages on a nice level.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Motorola has certainly made a nice progress this year. At their originally designed stand at the 3GSM 2007 held at the Fira de Barcelona they announced a bunch of new mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola stand</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RIZR Z8<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So here at this stand Motorola presented a rather innovative mobile phone that we hope would set the standards for their future portfolio additions. Their regular menu interface was getting too old and rusty now and was falling way back the competitors' solutions. So they needed to freshen up things in order to keep their market position. Obviously they've put some work into it and the end result is the Motorola RIZR Z8 - their latest and greatest slider. It has an unusual form factor - it's a kick slider as they call it but we would rather call it a flexi-slider. Flexi because basically when it's open, the body flexes in the middle in order for the handset to follow your face contour more naturally while you are talking on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola RIZR Z8 flexi slider form factor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise before it's opened you wouldn't know there something unusual about this pup. The Motorola RIZR Z8 feels nice when held in hand and it fits perfectly in your palm. We did spend quite a good time with it. Despite the unusual form factor, the keypad is still user-friendly. The navigation keys are not that comfortable though. At 15.3 mm, the Z8 features a 2.2" 16M colors TFT display, a 2 megapixel camera with red eye reduction, stereo Bluetooth, a microSD memory card slot, 3G with video calls and most importantly, it's HSDPA-enabled. The Motorola RIZR Z8 is expected to hit the shelves in Q2 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola RIZR Z8 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are rather amazed with the speed of its user interface reaction. The menu graphics themselves are rather nice and all in all it's a great upgrade. There is a nice Home Screen which allows different application shortcuts and add-ons to be added to the standby screen. The Motorola RIZR Z8 is also capable of playing fullscreen videos at 30 fps which we managed to see for ourselves. The most curious perhaps about the menu system is the fact that it is Symbian OS with UIQ user interface. This is supposedly the only UIQ handset without touchscreen. The good news is that it allows you to install third-party UIQ applications. The downside though is that all these applications are written for mobile handsets with touchscreens and they need to be adapted in order to run on Motorola RIZR Z8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola RIZR Z8 user interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For your viewing pleasure we have prepared our own exclusive GSMArena video of the RIZR Z8 interface - just to get the feel of it. Bear in mind that it looks way better in reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola SLVR L9<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other new update to the Motorola portfolio is the Motorola SLVR L9. is an updated version of the SLVR L7/L7e. The new mobile retains the design and form factor but enjoys the added benefits of a FM radio and a 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola SLVR L9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An innovative feature in the Motorola SLVR L9 is that it supports megaSIM cards which come with their own integrated memory. The black SIM card you see on the pictures is in fact a MegaSIM with 256MB of integrated memory. Capacities of those MegaSIM cards can soar up to 1GB of user memory - and that's without taking into account the memory card slot that this mobile is also equipped with. The MegaSIM card module delivers mobile operator customers with advanced mobile services such as MMS, MP3 and video clips downloading, full PIM functionality, and high resolution picture storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola SLVR L9 and the MegaSIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola SLVR L9 has also received the mirror-like finish of the Motorola KRZR K1 as well as a lot of chrome elements which according to us makes it look much more fashionable. In reality though, much like the KRZR K1 it is a real fingerprint magnet. Motorola SLVR L9 is expected to be available in Q2 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola L9 compared to KRZR K1</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola KRZR K3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola KRZR K3 represents a serious step forward in comparison to the original KRZR K1. It features 3G support with video calls and is HSDPA-enabled. The stereo Bluetooth capability seems to be the hit this year in Motorola's camp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola KRZR K3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KRZR K3 is again a shiny clamshell that easily gets smudged with fingerprints all over. As a matter of fact all Motorola handsets seem more or less fingerprint magnets. The KRZR K3 has retained the original RAZR-styled keypad but as far as navigation is concerned it has a lot more user-friendly D-pad than the RIZR Z3 and the SLVR L9. The K3 has the same 2 megapixel camera as its predecessor but has received an additional VGA camera for making video calls. As far as the interface is concerned, don't expect any miracles. The 3D icons on the standby screen and the semi-transparent camera interface are the only updates we could find. The MOTOKRZR K3 is expected to be available in Q1 2007.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Q q9<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Q q9 is the latest in the Motorola's line of messengers. This HSDPA-enabled messenger features a QWERTY keyboard, a 2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, a microSD memory card slot - and all that at a thickness of only 11.8 mm. It is also among the few devices that would run on the new Windows Mobile 6. The Motorola Q q9 is expected to be available in Q2 of 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola Q q9</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Q gsm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GSM version of the Motorola Q was finally made available. It was announced so long ago that we started to wonder if it will be ev0er really produced - so we are quite pleased to finally hold it in hand. It is based on the Windows Mobile 5.0 for Smartphone. The most interesting thing about it are the side controls - it features a 3-way jog dial plus a Task Switcher key which takes you through the currently running applications. The Motorola Q gsm feels more compact than the Motorola Q q9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola Q gsm</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola W205<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola W205 is among the several new Motorola budget handsets that may attract you with their simplicity and ease of use. The W205 is a classic bar-shaped talk-and-text phone with no frills. The 500 contact positions and 750 positions are more than enough. It's equipped with a 65K colors CSTN display and has a compact size and shape. The body is made of matt plastic and when compared to a Motorola W208 you can easily see that it's not made to impress. Otherwise it has a rather comfortable keypad and navigation. The Motorola W205 is expected to be available in Q1 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Motorola W205</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola FONE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola FONE F3 is not a newly announced device but it's a highly unusual budget handset. It is extremely slim and has a large display which though is inverted monochrome one. The dimensions of the FONE F3 are rather large except for the thcikness, of course. Motorola has tried to build it with extreme user-friendliness. The mobile is already market available but that's our first chance to make a live picture of it.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The new Samsung Ultra II line was all over Barcelona on various posters of different sizes ? most of them being really large. As you have probably seen on the introductory Barcelona pictures, it doesn't?t take long for the Samsung advertisements to catch your attention. The Samsung stand at the Fire de Barcelona where the 3GSM 2007 was dominated by the same thing although Samsung announced several other models beside the Ultras. It features four new mobiles - the Samsung U600, Samsung U700, as well as the Samsung U100 and the Samsung U300. All of the handset will also feature enhanced music playback capabilities thanks to the digital power amp which is developed by Bang and Olufsen. A wall at the Samsung stand reveals all the available colors for the new Ultra handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung advert and stand</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U600 (Ultra 10.9)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The highlight of the new Ultra series is definitely the Samsung U600 dubbed Ultra Edition 10.9. It's a stylish slider with a 3.2 megapixel camera, 2.2" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution, and a microSD memory card slot. The Samsung U600 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support. It features a really interesting combination of touch sensitive keys plus normal ones plus two extraordinary ones. The latter are the two receiver keys - they are not real keys as they do not move, nor do they give any feedback when pressed. They don't look like your ordinary touch keys either - in fact the do not respond to touch only. You have to press them harder and voila! They work - nice one. The Samsung U600 is a really interesting mobile as are the other Ultra mobiles - the innovations and the high-tech features cannot help but impress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung U600</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U300 (Ultra 9.6)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U300 dubbed as Ultra Edition 9.6 is an all-metal body clamshell featuring a 3 megapixel camera, a large primary 2.2" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution and a lot smaller gray OLED external display with a resolution of 96 x 16 pixels. The external display shows information about the clock, the network strength and the battery status. The Samsung U300 is also equipped with a TV-out port and the proprietary Samsung office documents reader. It has tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE network support. The keypad of the Samsung U300 is rather strange - it is entirely flat and there is almost no feedback when you press them. Yet they respond rather quickly and accurately when you actually do press them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung U300</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U100 (Ultra 5.9)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U100 (Ultra Edition 5.9) is advertised by Samsung as the slimmest phone in the world, measuring only 5.9 mm in thickness. Just for comparison the previous champion - the Samsung X820 had a thickness of 6.9 mm. The Samsung U100 has an identical equipment to that of the Samsung U300 with the exception of a smaller 1.9" 262K TFT display with a resolution of 220x176 pixels. The display looks rather strange since the horizontal side is longer than the vertical one. The handset is indeed really slim. You almost have a feeling that it would break when you apply some force to it. In fact it really does bend a little in the center when you push it - it's so slim. A nice feature it has that we didn't notice in the other Ultras is the Smart Dial as seen on Windows Mobile handsets. What it means is that typing a number directly from the standby screen filters the contact numbers in the phonebook and shows you all relevant entries. Our overall impression from the U100 is that it is really extremely thin - it almost makes you ask yourselves "How did they managed to squeeze an entire phone in that body?" Any slimmer than that and it would break as easily as a cracker in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Samsung U100</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U700 (Ultra 12.1)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U700 designated as Ultra Edition 12.1 is again a slim slider as the Samsung U600 but this time it's a HSDPA/UMTS/EDGE enabled handset with video telephony striving to provide the latest in high speed data transfers. It's equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with auto focus, and again a 2.2" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution, and a microSD memory card slot. It is again equipped with a wheel and a couple of touch keys, but the alphanumeric keypad is a different one with a more wavy shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung U700</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F300 Ultra Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ultra line is beginning to turn into something of a Ultra family of mobiles. It includes diversified mobiles for everybody's taste with somewhat specialized functions. A nice example of that are the Samsung F300 Ultra Music and the Samsung F500 Ultra Video. The Ultra line also includes the Samsung i600 Ultra Messaging. All three of them were which were announced last year but for now the only one that was showcased at the 3GSM 2007 was the F300 Ultra Music. We took the opportunity to play with it a bit since this is the first time we hold it in our hands. The F300 Ultra Music looks more like a MP3 player than like a mobile phone. It has a lightning fast user interface which by the way is the same as the one of the Samsung F500. The unusual thing about it is that the phone part of it has only a one-line display and yet it's a color TFT one and the proprietary black Samsung menu is shown on one line only and can be scrolled to the left or to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Samsung F300</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F510 Ultra Mobile TV<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides that it turned out that the F500 Ultra Video has got some successors in the face of the Samsung F510 Ultra Mobile TV. If you've ever wondered why the official pictures of the F500 include a TV antenna while it doesn't have a TV tuner, the possible answer is that the pictures are in fact portraying the Samsung F510 which was announced here at the 3GSM 2007. The probability of such an answer is further strengthened by the fact that the F510 is going to be released before the original F500 nevertheless that the latter was announced almost 3 months before the F510. The Samsung F510 is expected in Q1 of 2007, while the F500 would hit the shelves in Q2 of 2007.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung F510 Ultra Mobile TV features DVB-H support for enjoying mobile TV on the go and HSDPA for ultra fast data transfers. Otherwise, the specs remain the same as the ones of F500 - a 2.4" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution, tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support plus UMTS, 2 megapixel camera plus integrated DivX video player. The device switches between phone and player modes by the use of a side slider. The navigation of the player is performed through a Sweep Touch interface. What this means is that you move through the menu by making sweep moves on the touch sensitive navigation pad. Pressing only doesn't do the job you have to sweep your thumb across the pad in order to change between menu items. The integrated antenna tucks in safely into the body of the device. When it's extended the swivel base allow it to be rotated in different positions. The swivel form factor of the device really makes it unique since it allows to make the device sit on the desk or table and you can watch TV without holding it in your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Samsung F510</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the F-series, there was one other handset that wasn't officially announced but yet it was featured at the Samsung stand. It is the Samsung F200, the successor of the Samsung X830, which we have reviewed in detail. The new mobile has the same swivel form factor but its specs remain yet unknown. The two devices look almost the same, but the Samsung F200 has three columns of alphanumeric keys which allows for more user-friendliness. The navigation is no longer performed by an active wheel but by a regular navigation D-pad. Furthermore, the F200 doesn't feature a camera which is not that bad by the way since taking pictures with the Samsung X830 was a bit uncomfortable due to its form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Unannounced model - Samsung F200; compared to Samsung X830</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F700 smartphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ultra Smart F700, which was announced a week before the 3GSM 2007, was showcased at the 3GSM congress, but behind a protective glass so we couldn't get our hands on it. It has a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, HSDPA support, a 2,8" 262K colors TFT touchscreen display with the unusual resolution of 440x220 pixels, and a full sliding hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the regular smartphone functionality, the Samsung F700 features a number of unique hardware characteristics. Measuring 104 x 50 x 16.4mm, the F700 has an innovative touchscreen functionality called VibeTonz which allows user to actually feel the buttons on the touchscreen and pressing them produces slight vibrations for enhanced user friendliness. We saw much the same functionality on the Neonode N2, previewed here. Furthermore the interface features drag-n-drop functionality which would enable users to control almost all of the features of the mobile without the need for stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung F700</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F520 smartphone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another mobile announced this week at the 3GSM 2007 was the Samsung F520. It is a touchscreen smartphone much like the aforementioned F700. Its Flash interface is optimized for touch-navigation and there is no need for stylus. The 3" touchscreen display hides the sliding keyboard which is unique with its dual function. Sliding it to the side reveals a QWERTY keyboard. Slide it to the left and you have a regular MultiTap alphanumeric keypad. It also boasts a 3 megapixel camera, tri-band GSM/EDGE/UMTS support plus HSDPA. The F520 will be commercially available in Q3 of 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung i520 is a HSDPA-enabled business smartphone which also has GPRS/EDGE/UMTS support. The i520 also boasts a 2 megapixel camera, a large 2.3" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution. The smartphone is powered by the Symbian OS 9.2 with the 3rd edition S60 user interface and is controlled by touch sensitive keys. It also sports stereo Bluetooth support and microSD memory card slot. The latest edition of the Symbian OS looks nice and the i520 is equipped with a nice theme which looks as the proprietary black Samsung menu system used on all Ultra handsets. Six of the keys featured on the Samsung i520 are touch sensitive and they are combined with an analog joystick control.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i710 Pocket PC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i710 wasn't officially announced by Samsung but yet it was showcased at their stand. It is a fully functional Pocket PC with touchscreen functionality. Powered by Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC, it doesn't have Wi-Fi or a hardware QWERTY keyboard but it has a rather slim body which is really fashionable as is the case with all the recent Samsung mobiles. We got to admit that for a Pocket PC device it looks fabulous. The integrated Launcher applications transforms the user interface into the proprietary black Samsung menu system seen on all Ultra devices which we happen to like very much. The device also features a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus. The i710 is powered by an Intel XScale ARM920T PXA27x processor and as far as we managed to see, the device was pretty fast. The actual clock of the processor is yet unknown since the clock of this type of processor can vary a lot. But having in mind that the Samsung i320 and Samsung i300 have the same type of processor clocked at 416MHz our best guess is that the i720 also features a 416MHz processor. So far the detailed specs of the Samsung i710 are yet unknown but we are quite pleased with the device looks and feel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung P110<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P110 is a clamshell with a rather interesting design. It sports a VGA camera and a 2.1" 65K colors TFT display with a resolution of 176x220 pixels plus a full QWERTY keyboard. The Samsung P110 doesn't have a memory card slot but features stereo Bluetooth and has 25MB of memory. We tried to guess why the stereo Bluetooth when there isn't enough memory for uploading music on the mobile but our efforts were in vain. May be more information will be available in the future. The Samsung P110 has a rather comfortable QWERTY keyboard and the low-price segment has just received an exclusive messaging phone - up until now the QWERTY keyboard was reserved for an upper segment which consists of smarter phones with some kind of OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung E590<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 is a regular bar-shape phone but comes with a 3 megapixel camera with auto focus. It has a 1.8" 262K colors TFT display with the unusual resolution of 220x220 pixels, tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and a FM radio. The mobile has really small dimensions and the 3 megapixel camera on its back comes as a bit of a surprise since it doesn't look as a high-end phone at all. The mat black plastic of the unit we saw at the Samsung stand was more appropriate for a cheaper budget mobile solution. But the classic calculator design seems to be the hit this year and almost all manufacturers have at least one in their 2007 portfolio.</paragraph>

It has the proprietary Samsung document viewer which allows you to open office documents on the really large 2.2" 262 colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution. This slider is really stylish with an all-metal body and a display with a mirror effect. The soft keys are touch sensitive, while the alphanumeric keypad consists of perfectly level keys which though are rather comfortable to type with.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A novel, fresh, unusual? All these words easily apply to the Swedish Neonode N2, the second generation of enhanced touchscreen mobile phones that are anything but a regular handset. If you haven't seen the first line of these high-tech devices, there's no wonder that you gaze at the iPhone with amazement. We are just joking of course, but it would help if you take a peak at one of the first Neonodes in our GSMArena Phone Finder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Neonode N2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Originally displayed at the Neonode stand, we found the new Neonode N2 safely tucked in a baby's bed. Sounds of baby cries were coming through it loudspeaker, but enough about that, more on the device itself after the break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Congratulations! It's a... N2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neonode N2 is small touchscreen mobile phone with no hardware keypad at all and an original sweeping navigation interface system. It's hard to describe it in words so we propose to have a look at our exclusive GSMArena instructional video led by the Neonode marketing manager himself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> A short tutorial of the Neonode user interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we soon found out, those navigation gestures are really intuitive and the learning curve isn't steep at all. The Neonode N2 features joystick navigation too but it is used while browsing web pages only. The peculiarities don't end with the navigation system. To make or take a call you have to put the back side of the device to your cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Neonode N2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you've probably seen on our video, the menu interface, which by the way is powered by Windows CE 5.0, is graphic rich and pleasant for the eye. The OS is in fact stored on the miniSD memory card. The Windows background in fact allows it to synchronise seamlessly the phonebook and calendar with Microsoft Outlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Neonode N2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neonode N2 has the same display as its predecessors - a 2" 65K colors TFT with a resolution of 176x220 pixels. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS support and an integrated 2 megapixel camera. You can view your pictures and video in fullscreen landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neonode N2 will start shipping in Europe in Q2 2007 with an approximate price of 399EUR.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC P3350<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC P3350 (Love) is a Pocket PC which runs under Windows Mobile 5.0. It resembles a lot the current HTC P3300 (Artemis) but lacks GPS. Instead, it is equipped with dedicated music keys since it's the first multimedia-oriented device of the Taiwanese manufacturer. Powered by a 200MHz TI OMAP 850 processor, it features quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, FM radio and a 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation of the HTC P3350 is performed with the same HTC proprietary RollR as used in the HTC P3300. It consists of a wheel and a trackball at the same time. The wheel is used for scrolling among menu items while the trackball is used for navigating the mouse pointer on the display. The HTC P3350 (Love) will start shipping in March 2007.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC X7500 Advantage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC X7500 Advantage (Athena) is based on the Windows Mobile 2005 Pocket PC edition and comes with a hefty size and a weight of 359 g. It is powered by an Intel XScale 624 MHz processor and an ATi graphic chip and has a large 5" TFT touchscreen display with VGA resolution of 640x480 pixels. The HTC Advantage is also equipped with a detachable hardware QWERTY keyboard and has a hard disc with a storage capacity of 8GB. As we managed to check, the keypad itself is not the best one we've seen. It is surely styled nice, but it lacks any feedback at all and you can hardly tell whether you've pressed the key successfully or not. The body itself features a joystick and several other soft keys which means that the device can be freely used without the keyboard itself. The HTC X7500 Advantage surely feels heavy but is really compact when you fold it in its leather case along with the keyboard. Another drawback of the device is that the Windows Mobile OS fails to utilize the large resolution of the screen and all user interface elements seem unnaturally large.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for connectivity options, the HTC X7500 Advantage boasts quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, Wi-Fi, GPS, and stereo Bluetooth support plus a TV-Out port. On top of that it comes along with a 3 megapixel camera. The manufacturer states a rated 8 hour battery life which is far better than the 3 hour battery life of the average laptop. The HTC X7500 Advantage (Athena) will start shipping in March 2007.</paragraph>

As it proved, the keyboard is rather easy to use and type. The HTC S710 will become commercially available in the first half of 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The new device comes with almost the same functionality but with the added convenience of a sliding hardware QWERTY keyboard and a smaller weight. The processor used to run that baby is still the good old TI OMAP850 200MHz processor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson at 3GSM 2007<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, Sony Ericsson didn't announce any new handsets at the 3GSM 2007. Instead, they did it a week earlier. We are talking about the Sony Ericsson K810, the Sony Ericsson K550, the Sony Ericsson W610 and finally, the Sony Ericsson W880.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was clear from the get go that Sony Ericsson are putting a serious effort into highlighting the W880. At the press conference, held the day before the official start of the 3GSM 2007 congress, the most important men at the Sony Ericsson camp were more than happy to pose with it. Pictured here are from left to right: Carl-Henric Svanberg - President &amp; CEO of Ericsson, Miles Flint - President of Sony Ericsson, Sir Howards Stringer - Chairman &amp; CEO of Sony Corporation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson W880 is obviously the highlight</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What they also seemed to be happy about were their 2006 financial results which prove that the company is doing better and better and that 2007 would again be a great year for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson financial results and global operations</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the press conference we did saw an interesting advertisement of the now popular Sony Ericsson W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> It's official - Punk's not dead!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, having a nice time at the Sony Ericsson press conference after the official part was over was definitely something that was worth it, but the net day we go to some real work at the 3GSM 2007 congress. The Sony Ericsson stand was among the nicest and offered us some great opportunities for some hands-on experience with their latest mobiles - or at least with some of them. As you may recall, we already have done an in-depth reviews of two of their latest products - the Sony Ericsson W880 and the Sony Ericsson W550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson stand</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Being camera geeks, as we are, we managed to take some sample photos with the K810 camera. As it seems camera of the new product produces the same quality pictures as the original. So just to sum it up for you - if you already own a K800, most probably there isn't much reason to buy the K810. The upgrades to K810 only make it an attractive offer to people that don't still have the cameraphone of their dreams.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W610 is the new Walkman mobile phone which would try to build on the success of the Sony Ericsson W810 offering wide multimedia features to users - full music phone capabilities plus a 2 megapixel camera with auto-focus. It would have a quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, FM radio with RDS, Bluetooth with A2DP profile and a M2 memory card slot. We must admit that the W610 is a nice device. It feel good when held in hand, it has just about the right dimensions and finally it come equipped with the Walkman 2.0 music player which happens to be just great. The Sony Ericsson W610 will be available in selected markets from Q2 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There I more to Sony Ericsson than just Walkmans and Cyber-shots. This year's line up would also include some budget models that may also be interesting to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K200 features a VGA camera, 2MB of integrated memory, and would be equipped with a 65K colors CSTN display with a resolution of 128x128 pixels. As far as connectivity is concerned it has a two-band GSM/GPRS support and an Infrared port. The Sony Ericsson K220 boasts the same specs with the added features of FM radio with RDS and FM radio alarm clock. It will also be offered in different color combinations. Both mobiles have a user-friendly design but our personal opinion is that the black version is much more stylish than the white one which has some cheapish looks. The Sony Ericsson K200 and Sony Ericsson K220 will be available from Q2 2007.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson J110 and J120<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson J110 is the successor of the well-known budget model Sony Ericsson J100. It targets people whose main needs are simple - they need a talk-and-text mobile phone with a durable battery. Those devices really have user-frienliness in mind and are ideal for older people that are not in good terms with mobile technologies and find current mobile phones too confusing to use. The new J110 has got a face lift since the previous model J100 had a rather cheap plastic looks. The Sony Ericsson J110 is styled with shiny chrome details. It has a 65K colors STN display and a memory for 200 phone numbers. Its battery should allow it to offer up to 9 hours of talk time and up to 400 hours of standby. The Sony Ericsson J120 will have pretty much the same design except that it will be offered only in black. As far as specs go, the J120 has the advantage of a FM radio with RDS. The Sony Ericsson J110 and the Sony Ericsson J120 will be available in selected markets from Q2 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We also managed to have a chat with the Sony Ericsson W200. It's not a newly announced mobile, but since it's still not available on the market we decided to take some pictures of it too. Sony Ericsson put a lot of hops on it since it brings Walkman to the masses. It's a nice handset featuring the classic Sony Ericsson bar design with unusually small dimensions. It comes with the Walkman 1.0 music player but it still does the job.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG made a strong market presence for themselves with the start of their Black Label series with the LG Chocolate. After exploring the Chocolate theme to the max, they turned their attention to a new model family. It will be produced under the exclusive fashionable Black Label series again, but it will be based on an all-metal construction with a shiny surface. We are talking about the LG KE970 Shine and its modifications - the bar-shaped KE770 and the still unnamed Shine clamshell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the LG stand at the 3GSM 2007 congress revolved around the Shine theme and they were more than proud to show it off as much as possible. The LG stand was all about style and luxury - the same feels they ate trying to convey with their mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG stand</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Shine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the all-metal body with a mirror-like finish which reflects the surroundings when the display is off, the LG KE970 or Shine features an innovative scroll-key navigation, a 2 megapixel camera with Schneider-Kreuznach lens and a TFT display with a QVGA resolution. The Shine feels a bit overweight when held in hand, but that's of course due to all the metal that went into its construction. The scroll-key doesn't really serve some extraordinary function and it seems that it is used only for style purposes. We haven't seen a mobile phone with such a scroll key since Nokia 7110 and that was a really long time ago. Yet, the 7110 had some real issues with dust gathering under the scroll key making navigation impossible. That is the reason why Nokia never used that design again. But then again perhaps LG have managed to make it dust-proof this time. In terms of user interface, the LG Shine uses the same one as the previous models based on the Chocolate. It must be noted that the 2 megapixel camera is a lot quicker than the same one used in the LG Chocolate Platinum, a mobile we reviewed not long ago.</paragraph>

In much the same way the Shine clamshell was shown here at the LG stand with the only aim of showing the LG roadmap for the future of the Shine series. Specifications are still not known and the mobile doesn't even have an official model designation.</paragraph>

It also boasts a microSD memory card slot, 80MB of integrated memory and a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus. The interesting thing about it is that it is based on the Symbian OS with S60 user interface which practically makes it identical to the Nokia smartphone solutions. It's a stylish mobile and with the added smartphone functionality it will most certainly become a popular model.</paragraph>

It features a 1.7" 262K colors TFT display with a resolution of 176x220 pixels plus a 1.3 megapixel camera and a microSD memory card slot. The second one is The LG KU950 - the LG's attempt conquering the mobile TV market. The KU950 is supposedly the world' first UMTS-based HSDPA/DVB-H phone. It has a swing display and sports home VCR functions such as recording and screen capture. The rotating 2.4" 262K colors TFT display has a QVGA resolution, while the handset also comes equipped with a 1.3 megapixel camera and a microSD memory card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Prada phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this year on of the keywords in the mobile handset industry is without a doubt "the touchscreen controlled mobile". After the announcement of the Apple's iPhone it became the next magic word after "ultra thin". Well, while the iPhone may or may not hit the European markets around Christmas, the LG Prada is already being showcased here. When see the LG Prada phone two things come to mind - "ultra fashionable" and "full touchscreen capability". Those are things that are not seen in any other current GSM handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     LG Prada phone showcased at the LG press conference</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we did manage to get our hands on a working Prada phone - in fact on a couple of them, we will waste no time and would continue on to exploring its innovative design and technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                   LG Prada</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Prada runs under a Flash user interface and features a large 3" LCD touchscreen display with resolution of 240 x 400 pixels. The most interesting thing about the display itself is that it's made using the capacitive touchscreen technology. What that means is that the screen uses electroconductivity to sense your touch - much like the touchpad on the popular LG Chocolate. This technology is made to be used with fingers only, so the use of a stylus is out of the question whatsoever. At only 12 mm, the LG Prada phone also has a 2 megapixel camera with Schneider-Kreuznach optics which is also able to capture video with a resolution of 400 x 240 pixels at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are more than happy with the speed and user-friendliness of the user interface. As you will see from our exclusive GSMArena real-life videos, it reacts with the necessary speed to enjoy it as you would any feature mobile phone. Of course the shiny black surface of the LG Prada is a real fingerprint magnet but we are somewhat used to that already since as it seems shiny surfaces and materials are trendy this year in the mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Prada - the standard black &amp; white interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black and white theme can be easily changed with a colorful one if it pleases you more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Prada - if you prefer the color UI</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, you might want to know when will it be out there so you can grab it. Well... When we asked the LG officials about the availability of the device, they just looked at their watch - so that about sums it up. The Prada Phone by LG is expected in selected markets as of late February 2007 and the beginning of March 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sharp stand at the 3GSM 2007 was an attractive site but unfortunately most of the mobiles presented didn't have GSM support. And since we at GSMArena.com focus only on those models which do, we will present you the few Sharp GSM highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sharp stand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In January Sharp released special limited McLaren Mercedes edition of their mobiles Sharp GX29 (2G) and Sharp 770SH (3G) in support of the new team Vodafone McLaren Mercedes. The 3GSM congress gave us the opportunity to take some live shots of those mobiles. The handsets are inspired by the styling of the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes F1 cars - the chromed front for example.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We enjoyed the Sharp PV200 thanks to its snapping display which rotates readily at the touch of a finger. The device is already well known but here at the 3GSM 2007 Sharp presented a white NBA limited edition for the American market branded with the name of the NBA player Dwayne Wade. We liked the PV200 with its quirky form factor although the QWERTY keyboard had some cheap looks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>While we were at it, we managed to spot an unannounced Sharp slider which looked fascinating. It was showcased behind a protective glass and its model designation as well as specs are yet unknown. In fact the displayed pieces were only dummy phones so obviously we would have to wait to see more of the real deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Unannouced Sharp model</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite our devotion to GSM mobiles we decided to show you live pictures of a Japanese Willcom mobile that also caught our eyes. It won't be appearing on the European or the American market, but then again it looks so nice we couldn't help but present it here. Among the main facts we have on it are the VGA resolution display, the miniSD memory card slot and the USB host controller - the latter one so rarely seen on Pocket PCs.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It turned out that Toshiba too had some cards up their sleeves with some interesting mobiles. Starting with the Toshiba G500 smartphone slider we were surprised with the innovative addition of a fingerprint scanner we've seen in their notebooks. It is a security feature that we find attractive but we hope it doesn't pump up the retail price of the device. The purpose of the scanner is that you can lock the device to your fingerprint and it would not switch on if you don't authenticate yourself during startup. The device is powered by Windows Mobile 5.0 and features HSDPA and Wi-Fi support. Furthermore it has a 2 megapixel camera and a secondary front camera for video calls. The device has a rather nice design is really comfortable to use. The specs and the design are subject to change though since this is not an actual final version although it was a working preliminary version. The Toshiba G500 should be market available by the end of March 2007.</paragraph>

It is a Pocket PC powered by Windows Mobile 6.0 Professional with a sliding full hardware QWERTY keyboard. We must point out though that the upper row of keys is rather uncomfortable to use. That may change with time since as with the G900 the specs and the design are subject to change since the showcased unit was not an actual final version. The device has a large 3" TFT display with a Wide VGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels). The test unit didn't have the Windows Mobile interface quite tuned to the unusual resolution but the Toshiba staff promised that the final version would have that fixed and the device would be the first device with this kind of resolution on the market. The G900 is again HSDPA-enabled and features Wi-Fi and a 2 megapixel camera. Again, we see here a fingerprint scanner. This time though it comes with more available applications - you can set the scanner to start an application of your choice depending on which finger you have scanned. Furthermore, you can use it to scroll the screen by using sweeping moves across it. You can also select menu items by tapping the scanner. The other really interesting thing about the device is the integrated USB host controller which practically means that you can hook up any USB device to the G900 through its miniUSB port with the help of the USB adapter that would be included in the final retail package. The Toshiba G900 should be commercially available in the beginning of June.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Since we already were at the Toshiba stand we grabbed the opportunity to fiddle a bit with the Toshiba TS605 - their bar-shaped mobile which was recently announced and is already market available.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>i-Mate had put a lot of effort into advertising of their new Ultimate series of devices. For now they had only one working model of all the advertised handsets. It wasn't even a final design version and it was to undergo a lot of changes - the final versions would have a silver color and the screen won't be that shiny. The only working sample was the i-mate Ultimate 5150 - the slider one from the pack. The first impression you get when you see it is that it's rather large but all that is accounted for by the VGA resolution screens and the powerful Intel Bulverde 520MHz processor they are equipped with. But since basically all the models in the new i-mate series have the same specifications and just different form factors and sizes, everyone can find the appropriate size to suite their taste. The i-mate 8150 is a bar-shaped Pocket PC which is only 11 mm thin.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Alcatel managed well in presenting their mobile phones in an original way. Instead of using a stand in some of the halls as every other manufacturer did, they presented their upcoming mobile phones in a truck parked outside the buildings. You can bet it was no ordinary truck either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Alcatel truck - outside and inside</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that Alcatel are doing alright and they presented a lot of new phones to be released in 2007. They are concentrating on the low end market and their primary goal is to equip every telephone that comes with a camera with the additional features of Bluetooth and MP3 player. The first of their new mobiles is the Alcatel OT-E230. It has a highly-fashionable design but is real low-end since it doesn't feature a camera, integrated memory or anything else special. However it has a really small size and a weight of 83 g. The Alcatel OT-E230 would be more attractive to the female audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Alcatel OT-E230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel OT-C701 is a more advanced model, again in the low-end market segment. It features a VGA camera and as Alcatel promises, stereo Bluetooth and a MP3 player. The OT-C701 also has a 1.5" 65K colors TFT display with a 128x160 pixels resolution and a microSD memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Alcatel OT-C701</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel OT-C825 is a large slider which has a nice fashionable design though. It features a larger screen with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels, 1.3 megapixel camera and a microSD memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Alcatel OT-C825</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ELLE No 3 will be the next fashion phone by Alcatel. It will have almost the same specs as the OT-C825 but will be somewhat slimmer and will be targeted at the female audience. Unfortunately the ELLE No 3 samples we saw were all dummy phones and not working versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Alcatel ELLE No 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel have developed a stylish and fashionable Bluetooth headset again under the ELLE series. It is a perfect match for any ELLE phone and for every young lady on her way to the party.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HP presented only one new model at the 3GSM 2007. It is the HP iPAQ 514 Voice Messenger - a bar-shaped mobile with a rather conservative design. This smartphone is among the few devices that are already running on the new Windows Mobile 2006 Standard. Powered by the TI OMAP 850 200MHz processor, it also features a 2" 65K colors TFT display with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels and a 1.3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HP iPAQ 514 doesn't have 3G support but features Wi-Fi. Additionally, it has 64MB RAM and 128MB ROM and a microSD memory card slot. The keypad on the handset is comfortable to use but the screen resolution seems a bit unadequate. Otherwise we are pretty happy with the small and classic form factor. Otherwise we are pretty happy with the small and classic form factor. The HP press release promises quite a serious talk time with the supplied 1100mAh battery - a good 6.5 hours.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Blackberry is not among the widely spread brands but they are more than surely among some of the well-known mobile handset brands since they are the first choice for corporate solutions. The mobile handsets there were presented in a very original way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    BlackBerry stand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest memeber of the BlackBerry series is the BlackBerry 8800. It features quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, a QVGA display, Bluetooth, USB, a built in GPS receiver and media player. The 8800 is the Blcakberry with the largest QWERTY keyboard yet so far. It's also the slimmest BlackBerry device uptodate. The navigation is performed through the track ball which can go horizontally and vertically as well as in a diagonal way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated GPS works well and comes along with the preinstalled routing application. The maps are downloadable and they are free to the BlackBerry users.The device no longer has a camera since this way it is more comfortable for the business users who use their Blcakberries in high-security offices.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Gigabyte don't have such a strong influence on the European market and truth be told they only have a handful of handsets targeted at that market. Nevertheless their propositions have always been full of extras and technological innovations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte g-Smart t600 comes with DVB-H/DVB-T support and a VGA screen plus Wi-Fi. The DVB-H reception wasn't that fast in tuning in to a station but that may be due to the position of the stand in the 3GSM 2007 hall 2. Other than that it looks rather promising. The stylus of the t600 is telescopic, because it also serves as an antenna for the DVB signal reception. The Gigabyte t600 is powered by Windows Mobile 6.0 Pro and a 520MHz Intel XScale processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>          Gigabyte g-Smart t600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powered by Windows Mobile 6.0 Pro, the Gigabyte g-Smart q60 has a messenger form factor and it comes full of connectivity options such as HSDPA, GPS, Wi-Fi and a DAB TV receiver. The device is powered by the same 520MHz Intel XScale processor as the t600. It has a rather uncomfortable keypad since some of the keys had no feedback when pressed at all and it's not the greatest one if you have large fingers either. The q60 also comes with a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus. Unfortunately, we couldn't take the device for a spin as the test unit lacked a battery. Once again Gigabyte announces a goodie-bag mobile handset full of candies.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Gigabyte g-Smart i300 comes with the same 520MHz Intel XScale processor as the previous two. It features Wi-Fi, GPS, FM radio, a 2.1 megapixel camera and a 2.4" 262K colors TFT touchscreen display with a QVGA resolution. The device runs under Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Benefon Twig Discovery is a tri-band mobile GSM/GPRS that was also announced at the 3GSM 2007. It features an integrated GPS receiver plus and integrated navigation software which comes with several European maps and which allows for detailed routing with voice assist. The Twig Discovery has a stable construction but has a bit outdated design. The map application works really quick and it was able to find satellites even under the roof of the exhibition hall but that may not be indicative for the quality of the GPS receiver since the Benefon stand was on the top 2nd floor.</paragraph>
