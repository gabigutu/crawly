			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei introduced three new smartphones at the IFA 2014 fair - the Ascend Mate7, Ascend G7 and the Ascend P7 Sapphire Edition with a sapphire screen and ceramic back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate7 is a pretty big device but is packed with all the rage of modern technology. On the front there's a 6" 1080p display, an octa-core processor, 13MP/5MP camera duo for back and front and comes with Huawei's EMUI (Emotion UI) v3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend G7 is more of a midrange offering. It stacks up against the competition with a 5.5-incher of 720p resolution, a Cortex-A53 processor with four 1.2GHz cores and a 13MP/5MP combo of cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will cost &#x20ac;299 when it makes it to retail stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the break you'll find our hands-on with both devices including a lot of pictures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend Mate7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate7 features a 6-inch IPS LCD display of 1080p resolution, covered in Gorilla Glass 3. While some may be disappointed by the lack of QHD resolution on a diagonal of this size, Huawei makes up for it by the very slim screen bezels, which means the display enjoys an impressive 83% of the front panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood, Huawei's updated octa-core Kirin 925 CPU means business, with four 1.8GHz Cortex-A15 cores and four 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 cores, complemented by 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable memory (there will also be a 32GB variant with 3GB of RAM).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate7 looks slick and its 95% metal construction is the impressive 7.9mm slim. It's far superior to the plastic build of the original Ascend Mate, and even comes in lighter at 185g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back is where things get interesting. Despite the decidedly HTC One Max-inspired design, Huawei has brought some real innovation in the shape of fingerprint identification. The fingerprint sensor offers 8-bit grey level detection, 360-degree readability, and can even be used in wet conditions. It only requires a tap with a finger to activate, rather than the tedious drag routine on Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the upgrade to 13MP for the primary camera, it's only able to record 1080p videos @30fps, while the 5MP front-facer stops at 720p. The 4,100mAh battery is non user-accessible, but is rated by Huawei for up to 2 days of uptime and provides power saving modes that can last longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate 7 will be available in Obsidian black, Moonlight silver, and Amber gold for ?499 (?599 for the 3GB/32GB model), and is set to start selling this quarter in over 30 countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei have just announced their latest 6-inch phablet, the Ascend Mate7. It's an update of last year's 6.1-incher, featuring a slimmer 7.9mm frame, faster octa-core chipset running on Huawei's in-house Kirin 925 processor, and a larger 4100mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate7 features a high-quality aluminum alloy build, and impressive 2.9mm side bezels for a screen-to-surface ratio that's much improved over that of the Ascend Mate. The camera is based on a 13MP Sony sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, although it doesn't come with 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs Android 4.4 KitKat with the latest version 3.0 of Huawei's EMUI, and features an "instant single-touch" fingerprint sensor on the back that can be used to unlock the device or authorize payments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend G7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's the Huawei Ascend G7. It's built from a mold of plastic and metal and is packed into a unibody, clean design. The phone is built around a 5.5" unit of 1280 x 720px resolution which coupled with the large diagonal has a 267ppi sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend G7 has a quality feel to it and for 165g actually feels light, considering the size. We did notice a tiny air gap between the panels on the sides but we might have gotten to play with a pre-release hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device feels comfortable in one hand but operating it in such a way will be a tall order due to its size. If you've used a phablet device before you won't feel jarred by the Ascend G7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Emotion UI on top of Android KitKat runs smooth and without stutters but is a little confusing at times and will require some getting used to. We browsed a little on the Ascend G7 and found it perfectly adequate and fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While on the floor with the device we captured a few images with its 13MP snapper. Here they go below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we will withhold any assessment of the quality for a possible future review of the device. While shooting in 4:3 aspect ratio the Huawei Ascend G7 captures images of around 13.1MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 16:9 aspect ration the sensor of the Huawei Ascend G7 captures 10MP shots, here are a couple.</paragraph>
