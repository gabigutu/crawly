		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s face it, B7722 doesn?t sound particularly inviting. But you will be surprised to see that unlike most of the dual SIM phones on the market, which don?t do anything beyond the basics, the B7722 packs plenty of features that are rarely found on the spec sheet of such a niche device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might take the double-seven double-two as the slightest of hints but it?s nowhere near the Duos pet name that Samsung dual SIM phones usually get. Anyway, dual SIM action is the most important feature of the Samsung B7722 but it isn?t the only card up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides looking nice and handling two SIM cards all at the same time, the B7722 also has a 5-megapixel autofocus camera and above average connectivity options (including 3G support on one of the SIM cards and Wi-Fi). And on top of that you get a decently sized stylus-friendly touchscreen (measuring 3.2 inches).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although dual SIM phones are a sensible option for a certain set of customers, they will never be mainstream it seems. It?s arguable whether a more advanced set of features will broaden the phone?s appeal. Or risk turning away the hard users, who wouldn?t want to pay extra for features they deem irrelevant. The Samsung B7722 is an interesting device but that?s the kind of dilemma it?s facing. Just look at the specs below and notice just how little is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the B7722 packs in a lot. And while that certainly sounds good to us, it comes at a price. A pretty high one, by the way. The phone can be had for around 300 euro, which is rather steep for a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, maybe it?s the rest of the dual SIM phones out there to blame for being too cheap, and not the B7722 for being too expensive. That?s one of the things we?ll reflect on while reviewing the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us on the next page to see what?s in the Samsung B7722 retail package and take a closer look at the phone?s exterior.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Shiny little box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 comes in a tiny box with some shiny writing. That?s kind of odd since the phone itself isn?t really about glamour or fashion. In fact, the shiny lettering is in stark contrast to the rather plain design of the phone. Anyway, let?s see what?s inside the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 retail box packs quite a lot of things. There?s a small microUSB charger, a standard microUSB data cable, the usual paperwork as well as two CDs with the Kies software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a headset and a microUSB-to-3.5mm-audio-jack adapter with a Call/End button and a mic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7722 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 is more than decently sized for a dual SIM touch phone. The handset measures 113.5 x 55.5 x 14.3 mm and weighs in at 112 grams. Not bad at all. The Samsung B7722 fits snuggly in the hand ? the round edges make it very secure and comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing unusual in the looks of the Samsung B7722, but that wouldn?t surprise anyone since touchscreen phones aren?t the best devices to get creative with design. It?s all black, save for the shiny dark silver frame surrounding the display. ? much like the Samsung Omnia II really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is made of plastic of decent quality: essentially the Samsung B7722 feels good to handle and looks well put together. You may even go ahead and call the design attractive but we fear it doesn?t quite fit the target audience. There?s too much Corby in the styling while the likely dual SIM users are perhaps a little older. It would be difficult to guess what?s hiding under the hood just by looking at the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the front and the back are prone to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B772 features a 3.2? WQVGA resistive touchscreen. It?s responsive enough, but the sunlight legibility is questionable. The plastic over the screen is highly reflective and gets covered in fingerprints in no time, which doesn?t help at all. Basically the screen is only really useable indoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the earpiece. Right next to it, on the right, is located the secondary video-call cam. Below the display are the standard hardware buttons: Call and End keys, as along with the Back key in between. The End key doubles as a Power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung B7722 accommodates the volume rocker and the microUSB port placed next to it. You can use the microUSB port to connect the charger, data cable or the enclosed headset adapter (which allows you to use headphones with a standard 3.5mm audio jack). A plastic lid covers the connectivity port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side are the screen lock button, the SIM switch and the camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 bottom features only the mouthpiece while the top is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung B7722 has the 5MP autofocus camera lens, as well as the LED flash. The speakerphone grill is also at the back of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover there is the microSD card slot. Cards of up to 8GB of storage are compatible with the B7722. And indeed, the phone handled our reasonably full 8GB microSD card trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, you?ll find the two SIM card slots. Keep in mind that the 3G connection is only supported on SIM 1 so if any of your cards comes with a data plan, it would make sense to put it in the SIM 1 slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the battery, it?s a 1200mAh Li-Ion unit quoted at up to 420 hours of stand-by and up to 12 hours 50 minutes of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 raises no build quality questions. We didn?t experience any body creaks while reviewing the phone. It feels solid and is very comfortable to use as well. The Samsung B7722 doesn?t look classy (read: expensive) ? and maybe it?s just a bit too youthful for its target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the jump for a rundown of the Samsung B7722 user interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz 2.0 gets a plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 runs TouchWiz 2.0 Plus ? it?s much like the older TouchWiz versions but with many Bada touches to it. Plus stands for the several updates the UI got since the initial release of version 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the TouchWiz 2.0 Plus will feel comfortably familiar to long-term Samsung users, and it?s intuitive enough to welcome newcomers too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although technically a feature phone, the Samsung B7722 comes with a rich app package and there is of course support for Java, so you can install games and even apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz homescreen is widget-based and you can put as many of them as you can fit ? but you only get three homescreens and you can?t add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Widget button lets you pull out more widgets (or stash some away). The tray with widgets is at the bottom and works the same way as it did before. On the same line as the button are the three circled numbers, which indicate the currently active homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download new widgets too ? there are currently 21 items available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to ten), which are swipe-scrollable sideways. All apps (save for the user-installed Java apps) are accessible from this menu, so you won?t have to frequently dig through several levels of submenus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 also has a Task manager. However, you?ll be able to see it only if the phone runs out of memory and you need to close one or more running apps in order to open another application. So, switching between apps is actually impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When minimizing Java apps you can choose to suspend the app (which stops it from working until you get back to it), or you can let it work in the background (which may incur data charges).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 features the Smart unlock feature, which uses letter patterns to unlock the phone and can even launch an application automatically after the unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Etiquette pause feature is also available ? that?s just another name for ?turn to mute?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 with its TouchWiz interface is mostly hang-free but there are occasional lags in the image gallery when browsing 5MP images and with heavy pages in the browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SNS widgets and apps, no phonebook integration though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The B7722 comes with social integration in the shape of four neat homescreen widgets - MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Bebo, and MySpace and Facebook get dedicated apps as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four widgets have similar interface ? a big update button at the top, a text field for your current mood/status message and some buttons at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the MySpace widget, the available options include checking your messages, getting into chat and adding friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook widget offers checking your messages, adding new friends and the last option is poking a friend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Twitter widget has only two virtual keys ? friends and followers. The Settings button is available at all times, for auto-refresh or adding a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the widgets aren't exactly full of features, but the basics are covered. For more features, MySpace and Facebook have dedicated apps you can use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app shows your newsfeed, the wall and photos for you and your friends, messages, notifications and requests ? basically it supports it all. It can compose new messages too and upload photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets can access the Internet over Wi-Fi, so you don?t need to worry about extra data charges. The MySpace and Facebook apps refuse to work in offline mode for some reason, while the widgets don?t have this limitation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Communities application gets you links to websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Picasa, Flickr, Photobucket and more where you can upload photos and videos. You can also save your login details so you don't have to enter them each time. You can set it up to automatically resize photos and even schedule updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much covers what Samsung have been doing in the social networking department. Unfortunately, there's no phonebook integration, the kind you might expect in some smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Samsung B7722 will let you chat, update your status, post tweets, upload photos and read your friends' new posts.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual Samsung phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung B7722 has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names on both SIM cards, the phone memory or all at once and move and copy contacts between them (including from one SIM card to another). Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name or via the alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One annoying thing about searching by gradual typing is that it doesn?t support text prediction ? that is if you try to type ?DE? for Dexter, you?d have to tap the 3 key, wait a while and tap it again. Two quick consecutive taps won?t do: you?ll get ?E?, unlike typical smart dialing, which works in a similar manner to T9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While viewing a contact, tapping the button next to each phone number brings up a pop-up with three buttons ? regular call, video call and Send Message. The Call button in the contact list does only voice calls however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add a number of different fields for each contact - up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs, notes and so on. You can also assign individual ringtones for both calls and messages, a photo or video for Caller ID, even choose one of five vibrations for incoming calls from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature, if you?ll pardon the pun, is the ability to switch between left and right handed modes. This switches the position of the alphabet scroll only, the Call button next to each contact always stays on the right.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any cellphone ? the Dual SIM ability certainly holds the Samsung B7722 to a higher standard. We experienced no reception or voice quality drops for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset supports Smart dialing ? type in the first few digits of the number and a suggested contact will pop up. To search by gradual typing of names, you can use the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To choose the SIM card (SIM 1 or SIM 2) to place the phone call on, you have to press the dedicated button on the right-hand side of the phone. You can do that anytime before you hit the hardware Call key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You even have the option to automatically schedule which SIM card is to be default for outgoing calls according the time of day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SIM card indicators are displayed in the top left corner of the screen. The one currently in use turns green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Buddy list widget (a.k.a. Photo Contacts widget) is a fun way to browse your favorite contacts ? it uses a fake 3D environment and shows up to 8 contact pictures in an arc. You can scroll them up and down and dial the one you want. It's a gimmicky interface, and we don?t think it will be practical in everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 also comes with a pretty extensive Call Log application, which tracks anything from calls, data (network data only, Wi-Fi traffic is not included), messages sent, call durations and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Log is accessible from the main menu. It does reasonably well to accommodate the dual SIM functionality. It displays the type of call (incoming, outgoing, etc.), the SIM card used, the caller number/name and the number of calls. When you select a log entry, you can see the entire call history, including the time and date, as well as the call duration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the B7722 scored a good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with virtual QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung B7722 handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. You can activate delivery reports to receive notifications when the messages have reached the addressee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client does not have an option for automatic settings retrieval so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze. The email client also supports push messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to text input options, the B7722 managed to impress us with its decently sized virtual landscape QWERTY keyboard, which is a nice addition to the onscreen portrait 12-key multitap keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The B7722 file browser can display the files and folders in the phone memory or the memory card, and both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are designated folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds). You are not forced to follow this structure though ? you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems locating them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files ? both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the root folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading the memory card is quick and won't bother users. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast too. The initialization speed of the memory card is surprisingly fast: the Samsung B7722 recognizes an 8GB microSD card full of thousands of different files in less than 10 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The familiar gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is really fast and responsive but zooming can take a second on 5MP images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the one-finger zoom but it kicks in after you spend a couple of seconds touching the image with your thumb. Once it?s activated, it starts zooming in before you?ve even moved your finger, which is annoying if you?re trying to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available and the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can do slideshows too, but they are not customizable and scroll through a bit too fast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with DNSe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the microSD card slot, the B7722 music functionality is complemented by the great music player usually found on Samsung devices. What?s missing, though, is the 3.5mm audio jack. Well, you get a microUSB-to-3.5mm adapter which is better than nothing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art takes the entire top half of the music player screen with the basic controls underneath. Tapping on the album art will display additional overlay controls ? the progress indicator, a button to change the repeat mode, a shuffle button and an equalizer button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, as well as widening, dynamic and surround effects. You can?t create custom equalizers, but with such a wide selection of presets you really won?t need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DNSe sound enhancement offers Externalisation, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Mega bass, Wide and Concert hall presets for an even better sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify externally played music by sampling about 10 seconds from it and looking it up on web servers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 isn't the loudest handset we have put through our audio quality test but it wasn't too quiet either. Plus its output is decently clean so the overall impression is rather positive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is good enough with the deviation never exceeding 0.86dD in the audible range. The noise level and stereo crosstalk readings are pretty good and neither the distortion levels nor the dynamic range is anything to be concerned about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the detailed results.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio with a built-in recorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 features an FM radio with RDS. The radio app works with Find Music too, which is great if you missed the name of the song playing on the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheap way to get individual tracks or whole song sets off the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM broadcast recordings are in the MP3 format, 192Kbps 32KHz for High quality (that results in about a megabyte for each recorded minute). You can also pause the recording if you want to skip the commercials for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s the radio widget too, which gives you control over the radio from the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player could be better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. All the basic are covered though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MP4 videos (so, no DivX and such) but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. VGA videos were a no go, even CIF (352 x 288 pixels) failed to play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera that can take photos with a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. Along with autofocus you get a LED flash; there is no lens protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice surprise, the camera has a number of extra features like smile shot, preset scenes, viewfinder gridlines and panorama mode. There is no geotagging, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized ? it's almost the same as on the Samsung S5620 Monte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Samsung B7722 is actually pretty good. We?re used to seeing images affected by too aggressive processing. Well, this is not the case here. The images taken with the B7722 will probably need some final touches made on a computer. But we?d rather have that than photos ruined by too harsh internal processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos have low contrast, which makes them seem a bit dull, but at least there?re no blowout. There isn?t much noise to see and we were glad to notice that there were no artifacts caused by oversharpening. As for fine detail, it?s fair for a 5-megapixel shooter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 offers video recording too, but it's nothing to get excited about ? it only manages QVGA at 30fps. It?s ok for MMS or for watching on the phone screen but nothing more than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 has quad-band GSM support so it?s usable worldwide and it also packs 3G support on the 2100 band. There?s 3.6Mbps HSDPA support for faster downloads. However, keep in mind that 3G is only supported for the SIM 1 card. For data-intensive tasks you also have the option to use Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi manager is the standard Samsung one and will do the job perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is available and it comes with A2DP support. The microUSB port for syncing and data transfers is also on board and it can charge the phone off a computer. In mass storage mode, you can access the memory card but not the built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no 3.5 mm audio jack on the device itself but an adapter is enclosed in the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is great (when it works)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722, like other Samsung feature phones, has the WebKit-based Dolfin web browser. With Flash support and one-finger zooming, it is one of the better web browsers we have seen on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolfin browser also supports double tap for zooming to a specific part of the page and zooming back out. The browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual zooming is slow ? it takes a couple of seconds to redraw the content when zooming in, but the panning and scrolling are fairly smooth (only longer pans lag a bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash support extends to include full featured YouTube videos but the B7722 fails to make full use of those. It either has insufficient system memory or memory management lets it down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t manage to play a video on YouTube, not even on other video sharing sites. Flash games also failed to work. The browser kept throwing ?Page too large? errors each time we tried to zoom in, even after a fresh restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this makes the browser very frustrating to use on content-heavy pages, but when the browser works - it?s great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, you could always pass on the preloaded web browser and go for the nice and zippy Opera Mini, which is said to cure the out-of-memory problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views ? daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week ? the options are Monday or Sunday. There are two types of events ? Schedule and Anniversary ? and you can choose the starting date and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is fully customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with a custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung B7722 is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7722 comes with a Dictionary app, which works for English and can save words in the ?My Vocabulary? list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the great additions to the software package. It supports Office 2007 files and one finger zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files and panning is quite fast. However when we tried to open our PowerPoint test file, the phone spat out a memory error.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Exchange ActiveSync support is also enabled, which should appeal to corporate users. There?s even a handy widget, which lets you sync, compose new email, check mail and toggle push messaging. It can be minimized so it doesn?t take much space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 features the Palringo instant messenger preinstalled. It supports various protocols ? G-Talk, ICQ, AIM and MSN. It can handle multiple chat sessions at once and has the option to share your location. Registration is easy and adding new services is pain-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if the B7722 lacks a built-in GPS receiver, it comes with Google Maps preinstalled. It has all the usual features and can be quite handy at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung B7722 comes with 5 game titles on board ? Monopoly, Millionaire, Brick Breaker, Brain Challenge 2, and Asphalt 4 WCG. All of them are demos only. There isn?t even a single full version game preloaded.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7722 certainly is worth a look. But is it worth your time and money? To begin with, if dual SIM service is a must you?re given a limited choice already. There are people out there who would swear dual SIM phones are the best this industry has ever come up with. But dual SIM phones will never be mass market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how does it work for the Samsung B7722? It is ready to accommodate two SIM cards and packs a touchscreen. It?s also quite social and enjoys taking pictures or listening to music. These are all nice features to have ? and we can remember quite a few touchscreen feature phones that made a fortune with far less impressive feature sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That takes us to the question of price. The B7722 has nearly all we would normally expect in that price range. At launch, the phone had a 400 euro price tag and now it goes for around 300. That?s serious money for a feature phone. More importantly though, we?re not sure how many dual SIM shoppers will find the value-adding features relevant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can?t ignore the fact either that the Samsung B7722 has a serious RAM issue. The phone is struggling with multiple applications running at the same time. The whole thing is at its worst when browsing the web. But to be fair, there?s an easy way around this: the Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you do need dual SIM action, the B7722 should definitely be on your list of things to see. No need to remind you, the solid connectivity (including Wi-Fi) is more than welcome. What?s working against the Samsung B7722 is the general view of dual SIM handsets as the perfect second phone ? a cheap two-in-one device that?s nice to have at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One that fits this profile better is the Samsung B5722. It is a full touch dual SIM feature phone as well but it?s cheaper for a reason. The screen is smaller, there is no Wi-Fi and the camera is relegated to 3MP. It does cost half the price of the B7722.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Speaking of alternatives, the LG GX500?s feature set is almost identical to the Samsung B7722?s. So don?t forget to check it out, too. It offers a 3-inch WQVGA touchscreen, Wi-Fi connectivity, 3-megapixel still imaging, as well as a promising 1500mAh battery. As for its price tag, the GX500 costs around 200 euro.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>For the same 200 euro you can get the Gigabyte GSmart S1205. Unlike the other dual SIM phones mentioned so far, it is a smartphone. And of course it can handle two SIM cards as well. The GSmart S1205 runs WinMo 6.5 Professional, packs a 3.2? touchscreen of WQVGA resolution, Wi-Fi support and a pretty nice user interface. Just like the B5722 and the GX500, the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 skimps on 3G.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, to sum it up, there aren?t that many full touch dual SIM phones on the market and the Samsung B7722 is in the premium zone of a niche that?s pretty limited to begin with. It?s not overpriced for what it offers but it does seem like it?s charging more than the typical customer is willing to pay. If Samsung are trying to change how people see dual SIM phones, the B7722 will be right to claim credit. Could be a consolation for the fact that it?s just not meant to be a market success.</paragraph>
