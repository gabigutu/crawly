			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s a sequel. Same cast and the same story but with a new lead and a new director. Shot in HD. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo is to settle some unfinished business at the box office. A year stands between the Vivaz and the Neo and Android does make all the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Neo is part of Sony Ericsson?s new droid lineup and takes advantage of all the new features ? the LED-backlit Reality display with Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine, an 8 megapixel Exmor R camera sensor, 720p video with continuous autofocus and the latest Android ? 2.3 Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neo benefits from new technology but it does well to focus on the important stuff: imaging. It?s not the 3.7 touchscreen that makes this phone, nor is it the 1 GHz CPU or the latest Android Gingerbread. And hey, these are all fine features to have. But in the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo the HD-enabled cameraphone comes before the all-round droid smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The short list of downsides gives away a well-focused device. The XPERIA Neo is spared the predicament of a flagship too. While the Arc might be unsettled by the new dual-core beasts ? the Neo doesn?t need top specs to be good at its main job. The previous generation hardware is less of a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having met the Neo, this review doesn?t look as such a tough challenge. All it needs to do is cement the good impression it already made. Such kind of safety can be deceptive though. Let?s hope the Neo didn?t let its muscles soften. You?re welcome to follow us as we try to find out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well bundled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself and the usual set of accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for charging and computer connections) and a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are a couple of user guides and an 8GB microSD card in the box. The only thing missing is an HDMI cable ? microHDMI to HDMI ones aren?t so widespread and you might not have one at home. But the Neo?s price is cheaper enough, so we didn?t really expect to find one here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo stands at 116 x 57 x 13 mm and weighs 126 grams. It looks slimmer than the numbers will tell you, because of its shape ? what Sony Ericsson call the human curvature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Neo shares a lot of DNA with the Vivaz and this is by no means an accident. The Neo is a true successor of the popular HD capable cameraphone. It was even previously rumored as Vivaz 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Neo is not the only one to resemble the Vivaz. The XPERIA Pro is another design copycat (in a good way). The three devices can be mistaken by the less attentive observer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neo will be available in thee color versions: Silver, Blue Gradient and Red. We have the Red version this time around, having already met the Blue Gradient unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the Neo is entirely made of plastic but that?s not to be held against it. Like the Vivaz, the Neo doesn?t need metal to boost its self-esteem. The shape and weight are just right and the phone is solidly built . Of course the glossy plastic rather easily gets covered with smudges that are hard to clean up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the phone?s front is taken by the 3.7" 16M-color LCD screen with resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The Neo uses the same Reality display as the XPERIA Arc, based on the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine. The high-quality LED-backlit LCD has pleasing colors; contrast and sunlight legibility are decent too. The questionable feature is viewing angles: contrast quickly degrades and the colors get washed out when looking at the screen at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Reality display is no match for the Samsung?s SuperAMOLED, it?s on the better side of LCDs and the latest Sony Ericsson smartphones are sure to benefit from using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the final retail unit of the XPERIA Neo had a display of different characteristics compared to the pre-released unit we had. Sony Ericsson has managed to improve the contrast even more since the last time we met the Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen we find the usual set of controls: hardware Back and Menu buttons, each side of a Home key. The controls are thin but quite solid to press and, being placed on a subtle chin, they are quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty crowded above the display: there?s the earpiece, an ambient light sensor, the secondary VGA camera and a proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand side of the XPERIA Neo is completely bare, while the right all the action. That?s where you have the volume controls and two small knobs: the power/lock button and the shutter key. The camera button is tiny but with excellent tactility, placed within a slight recess whose raised rims are easy to locate by touch. Not a big deal but quite thoughtful of Sony Ericsson. There?s a tiny status LED next to the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s busy at the top too ? there we find the microUSB and microHDMI ports on each side of a 3.5mm audio jack. Both the USB and HDMI ports are covered by small plastic lids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson Neo reveals its key purpose ? imaging. Just like on the Vivaz, the 8MP lens is unusually placed almost in the middle. It makes sense actually ? the lens is nearly impossible to accidentally cover with a finger. The lens is recessed to ensure protection against scratches and smudges. Next to it, there is a LED flash, which is mostly useful as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is all the way at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover, though not beneath the battery itself and is therefore hot-swappable. The Neo supports 32GB cards and comes with a complimentary 8GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is under the impressive 1500mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo is quite reasonably sized and well within limits of pocketability despite its 3.7? display. It?s well built and there is nothing to complain about other than the fingerprint issues. The XPERIA Neo feels solid and is quite comfortable to hold and operate. It doesn?t look cheap, never mind the all plastic body. Even the smallest details are very consistent with the phone?s imaging-centric nature. The phone looks quite a bit like the Vivaz but duly updated.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Deep blue?Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread and Sony Ericsson have integrated it with the Timescape UI to make their products distinguishable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo runs on exactly the same software package as the Xperia Arc. There are no differences in the looks, performance or functionality so we'll be reusing portions of the Xperia Arc review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a short video demo of the Xperia Neo user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.3 Gingerbread has brought lots of new APIs and extended the platform?s gaming capabilities, but the interface elements haven?t been drastically altered. And with Sony Ericsson skinning the whole thing it?s even harder to spot the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we particularly like is the Overview mode on the Sony Ericsson Neo. You pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new pane sets in with a cool transition effect to display all of your active widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s similar to HTC?s Leap view or what Samsung have on the Galaxy S. However widgets are not ordered in mini screens so you cannot see what?s on each of them. Widgets are shuffled instead so they can better use the space. They are as big as possible and thus easier to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next thing to note are the four docked shortcuts (two either side of the launcher key) on the homescreen. Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is nice and simple, the way it?s done on the iPhone. You drag an icon over another and a pop-up appears, prompting you to select a name and layout for the new folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are new animations when moving items around the homescreen, sorting them in folders or deleting them. There are no new wallpapers included in Gingerbread, but you can get as many as you want from the Android Market anyway. Sony Ericsson have included 24 static wallpapers and there are 11 live wallpapers too. You can also set a picture from your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new Sony Ericsson app called LiveWare is preinstalled on the Xperia Neo. It lets you set the behavior of your handset when paired with an accessory. You can have an app launch automatically when headset, headphones or a charger is connected. You can, for example make the Neo start the music player each time you plug-in your headphones or go to picture frame mode each time you connect a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface. Gingerbread really takes things to a whole new level by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as general performance is concerned the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo does splendidly. It uses a Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon System-on-a-chip featuring a 1 GHz Scorpion CPU and the Adreno 205 GPU. The Gingerbread optimizations help too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it?s not synthetic benchmarks that we should focus on ? the real life performance matters here and the Xperia Neo is smooth as silk. Sony Ericsson did a vastly better job this time than the Xperia X10 a year ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Timescape UI is here to stay<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. Timescape has a tabbed structure, allowing you to filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you can not only see the latest activities and updates from your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or call back if you have a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of the new Timescape is you can set it as a widget on you homescreen. It will show all of your updates as tiles. You no longer need to sacrifice all your homescreen estate. Good job!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A beautiful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Neo?s visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. The list can be sorted by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If someone is added in more than one account, you can ?join? their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony still misses smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Neo held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia Neo does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo. Scoring a Below Average result, the Neo isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might miss a call or two at times. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Android values simplicity in design and is very easy to use. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick Contacts feature only works in separate messages, not in the whole thread. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only to three lines, which makes working with longer texts harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Neo offers a just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even on the portrait keyboard, typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The Neo is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course. For proper typing, you should consider a QWERTY messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery downsizes photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Neo uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Xperia Neo's multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia Neo as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia Neo did play a 720p MP4 video though. And the 3.7? FWVGA Reality screen is a pure joy to watch. If you re-encode your videos before hand, the Xperia Neo can make a good video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you should just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Another beauty ? the music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia Neo is quite similar to the music section of the axed Mediascape app. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get send and delete options. There is also a dedicated search bar at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key, which allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service for song recognition is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our audio quality test the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo did just as good as its Xperia PLAY and Arc siblings. It excelled with great frequency response and low noise levels and excellent dynamic range readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problems we noticed is the stereo crosstalk, which spikes when you plug in a pair of headphones, and its its overall average loudness. The distortion levels increase too in that scenario, but they still remain tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an active external amplifier, on the other hand, you are also getting some pretty low distortions and stereo-crosstalk readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range 8 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Neo boasts an 8 megapixel snapper with a single LED flash. The Neo uses an Exmor R backlit sensor which, in theory, provides better low-light images. In reality the advantage of the backlit technology is marginal at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Neo?s camera is quite intuitive. You have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features on the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder switch at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most used shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to pick a scene, turn on flash and switch to the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. As is to be expected from a device in this class, the Xperia Neo also boasts face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is a mixed-bag. There?s enough of fine detail in the Xperia Neo shots, but it?s a lot lower of what we saw on the Arc?s images. The color rendering is good, but the noise levels are too high and in some places you can observe the so-called staircase effect. We really hoped for much better than that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see from the comparison tool that the Arc?s doaing much better than the Neo in shooting stills although they should have identical sensors. The Arc exhibits less noise and produces more natural looking images in terms of sharpness.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HD video recording is turning as a hot feature recently and the Xperia Neo is doing relatively well with the framerate. It?s 30fps and quite steady too. There were a few duplicated frames, but not that much to ruin the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neo?s camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. Its approach is the same as on the Xperia X10 and the Arc: it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe instead of fast and constant re-focusing. It?s certainly the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos run smooth, but have the same problems as the still images. This time they are virtually identical to those by the Xperia Arc. The resolved detail is good, the noise levels are kept low, but the staircase effect is visible on too much places as it was on the Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Xperia Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is another one that we uploaded on YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We added the Xperia Neo samples to our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with the other 720p mobile camcorders we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can see the staircase effects on both Arc and Neo and compare it to other (better) HD camcorders. Surprisingly the Neo managed to resolve more detail in our comparison video, than the Arc.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo has the full set of connectivity options: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), USB v2.0 and Bluetooth 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage is 320MB only, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone will ship with an 8GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nexus S though, there is no NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack and the mini-HDMI port complete the connectivity tally. Unfortunately you?ll have to buy your own HDMI cable, it?s not included in the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser speaks Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With added Flash 10.1 support and the latest and fastest UI version, 2.3.2 Gingerbread, the Neo?s web browser does a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface chrome is pretty light at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 3.7? screen for web browsing. The Neo?s browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap zooming ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the big updates of the Xperia Neo?s (or any other Gingerbread phone) web browser is the full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.2 player. YouTube videos played quite smoothly (360p-480p), and so did the games from Kongregate, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Neo supports the latest Adobe Flash 10.2 but you have to download it separately for free from the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is full suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on the large, high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching all kinds of files is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. Unfortunately you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But all of the applications missing on the Xperia Neo can be downloaded for free off the Android Market in a matter of minutes, so it?s not a big deal really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps, GPS and limited navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo comes with a GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in about 2-3 minutes with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the main application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia Neo came with Maps 5 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has tons of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Neo runs the latest version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson is introducing new additions to their refreshed Android lineup as we speak. With newly found processing power, bigger high-res screens and HD video, even the new Xperia minis are children who will prey on their parents. The difference between old and new Xperia just cannot be overstated. And the Neo is certainly a part of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo has the latest features of the house. Equally important ? it?s the same features that they thought worthy of the flagship. Of course, the Neo will at some point have to worry about the lack of dual core and 1080p video. But it will be a while before they start to make a real difference. And when they will, the Arc will be standing in front to cushion the blow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?ll be enough room for the Xperia Neo to hide behind its bigger sibling?s back. The Arc flaunts a massive 4.2? screen. It?s one of the prettiest phones lately but all the coolness will cost you more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Neo?s more likely rivals are nowhere near the description of a flagship. But with enough Gingerbread phones around, the competition is pretty strong. Let?s have a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is a bestseller with loyal fans around the world. The 4? SuperAMOLED screen and the 1GHz processor have just received a boost from Gingerbread. An excellent package has just got better but it?s an older phone that will be gradually weaned off OS support. Price is in the Galaxy?s favor, and so is the SuperAMOLED screen (if you?re lucky). It?s a tie in terms of video, the Neo getting the upper hand in still imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S is friendly and compact but you?d be wrong to underestimate its ability. Gingerbread-powered, beautifully built and HTC-Sensed, the Desire S is a viable alternative except in the imaging department. The 720p videos are quite good but stills are obviously no match for the Xperia Neo?s 8MP photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need a real contender for imaging skills, it must be no other than the Nokia N8. The bigger 12 MP sensor, the Xenon flash and the 3x zoom in video capture leave little doubt as to which one is the superior cameraphone. With Gingerbread inside though, the Xperia Neo is the better smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A smartphone and a cameraphone, the XPERIA Neo promises solid all-round experience, which it readily delivers. It won?t cut it as a flagship but fortunately that?s not part of the job description. The Xperia Neo will enjoy the sense of space and safety in the upper midrange. And it will certainly take pride in being an option some users will gladly consider ahead of the Xperia Arc.</paragraph>
