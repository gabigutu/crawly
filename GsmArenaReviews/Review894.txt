			<subsectionTitle>The GSMArena tablet shopping guide: December 2013<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not that a disclaimer is needed but the timing of this article is purely coincidental. Helping you decide what gadget to buy is what we've been doing for over a decade, and not just around the Christmas holidays. So, there we go, simply following up on our smartphone shopping guide, with a similar piece on tablets. Whether it's a low-cost compact slate for a stocking stuffer, or a full-size powerful performer to let you start off the new year with a bang, everyone wants to know what the best deal is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've divided our tablet recommendations into three distinct categories: compact, midsize, and full-size. And since tablets generally come in both WiFi-only and 3G/LTE-enabled variants, we've split each section accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things started in the compact tablet category, which has seen an especially large amount of activity in recent months thanks to offerings like the Google Nexus 7 and the Apple iPad mini with Retina display. Compact tablets are growing in popularity not only in casual living room environments, but also out in the open and even in corporate scenarios, thanks to their versatility and portability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, midsize tablets are for people who want a bit more screen estate, while still retaining the mobility of compact offerings. What exactly constitutes a midsize tablet will be different for each individual user, and can vary anywhere between 7.5"-9". We'll give you plenty of choice when it comes to finding the right combination of size, features, and price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, full-size tablets are those that touch or cross the 10" mark. This is where top manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, and Apple will duke it out for dominance, with great deals like the Google Nexus 10 sneaking in, unseen but not unnoticed. Some of these tablets are just a keyboard away from compact laptop territory, so be sure that is the way you want to go when you're considering your options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each section, we order our recommendations starting with the cheapest, most worthwhile tablets available from a reputable manufacturer. While so-called "whitebox" offerings from lesser-known manufacturers are surging and account for a huge amount of tablet growth over the past couple of quarters - particularly sub 8-inchers running Android - their low cost oftentimes comes at the expense of getting lower performing components and simply don't offer a reliable and consistent user experience (let alone future support updates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we get started with our compact tablet recommendations, or you can jump right to what you're looking for using the links below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be keeping this guide up to date, so be sure to check back regularly to see what new recommendations we come up with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WiFi-only Compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter, we'll be focusing on compact tablets measuring about 7" and lacking cellular connectivity. This includes tablets that either do not have 3G-enabled models at all, or the lower-cost WiFi-only versions of tablets that do. The list is sorted by price, low to high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things underway with the Nook HD tablet from Barnes &amp; Noble. The Nook offers a 7-inch 1440 x 900 display, alongside a rather modest 1.3GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 processor. What the Nook really has going for it, however, is the price - at less than ?100, it simply can't be beat by the major manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some sacrifices were inevitable, of course, and those come in the form of performance and availability. The Nook's TI OMAP 4470 processor is passable at best in terms of processing power and, given that Texas Instruments has retired from the chipset game, could go the way of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and have difficulty getting future Android versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind that the Nook could be hard to find in your region. Of course, all Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, so you better know your rooting/CyanogenMod if you are going the Nook's way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is a compact tablet from Asus. While not necessarily the first name that comes to mind when it comes to compact size tablets, Asus is not the world's third largest tablet maker and Google's prime tablet hardware partner for no reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus MeMo Pad HD7 offers a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. For all intents and purposes, it's a cheaper version of the original Google Nexus 7 (also made by Asus), except that it's running on MediaTek chipset and has a microSD card slot for expanding the limited memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation Nexus 7 tablet caused quite a stir at its unveiling this summer, and Google/Asus really went out of their usual ways to give the Nexus 7 a complete and thorough upgrade. The tablet is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset with Adreno 320 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. The Nexus 7 is one of the first tablets to run Android 4.4 KitKat, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, it's the only one of our tablet recommendations that weighs below 300 grams. The only real downside is that is has no memory card slot, so you should definitely pay the premium to get the 32GB model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in terms of raw horsepower, nothing beats the Kindle Fire HDX. It runs on a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. While it will handily outperform the Nexus 7, its Android version is highly customized and does not have Google Play support. Instead, you'll have to rely on the less-robust Amazon App Store for your app needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card slot either, so we recommend at least the 32GB version if you decide to go for the latest Kindle Fire.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you plan on taking your compact tablet on the go - and let's face it, seven-inch or thereabout is the only tablet size that's actually portable - then 3G and LTE are likely on your list of features. After all, there won't be WiFi hotspots everywhere, and a tablet's utility becomes somewhat hampered without being able to go online. What follows is a list of recommended compact tablet offerings that let you connect to a 3G and/or 4G/LTE networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus FonePad 7 is a low cost option that has 3G connectivity and even supports phone calls. You can currently find it for about &#x20ac;100 less than 3G/4G-enabled variants of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should factor in the cost of a microSD card to expand the otherwise limited storage though (around 25 euro for a 32GB card).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad 7 Vogue from Huawei is another affordable offering on par with the Fonepad 7. While it offers an inferior screen of 600 x 1024px resolution and a 3MP camera, it does have a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor. Keep in mind that the MediaPad 7 Vogue only has support for a limited set of 3G bands, so be sure your area supports HSDPA 900 / 2100 if you're getting it for the 3G connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Factor in the cost of a microSD card as the 8GB of internal memory will run out very quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 7's LTE-enabled variant winds up next on our list. It offers a wide array of support for different LTE networks, so you can be assured that it'll work in many areas - even if you're traveling overseas. Like with the WiFi-only version, we recommend going for the 32GB version as the Nexus 7 does not have microSD card support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kindle Fire HDX brings the same stellar performance with its quad-core 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor into the LTE arena. Keep in mind that it has the same limitations as the WiFi-only version: no Google Play support and no microSD card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WiFi-only midsize tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's hard to determine where exactly compact ends, midrange begins, and full-size takes over, which is why the screen diagonal margin in this chapter will be fairly large. But, if you're the Goldilocks of tablets and find compact too small and full-size too big, then it's almost sure that at least one of the tablets mentioned in this selection should be just right. On this page we cover WiFi-only variants, which means that these tablets are best for home or office-only use rather than on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the 7-inch Nook HD tablet as one of our compact tablet offerings because of its great price, and now here we see the larger 9-inch Nook HD+ for the same reason. The HD+ offers the same dual-core TI OMAP 4470 processor as the Nook HD, except it's clocked higher at 1.5GHz. Screen resolution for the larger display is also bumped up to 1920 x 1280 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same sacrifices to performance and availability have to be made, however. The Nook's TI OMAP 4470 processor is a rather dated option that's not going to impress anyone in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nook HD+ isn't widely available, and could be hard to get in your region. Of course, all Nook tablets come with a custom Nook UI, which is quite far from a true Android experience, although it does offer access to the Play Store and its large app selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos has been slowly building a reputation for affordable yet competitive WiFi-only tablets, and its most capable 8-inch offering is exactly that. The Archos 80b Platinum comes with a quad-core 1.6GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Its screen resolution is a paltry 1024 x 768, and it has only 8GB of internal memory (which you'll have to expand via the microSD card slot), but it does come with a microHDMI port, and is the only offering in the midsize lot that can be had for under ?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG released its first tablet in almost a year just in time for this holiday season, and it's a doozy. Featuring a 1200 x 1920 pixel 8.3-inch display, the LG G Pad 8.3 runs on a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 processor with Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of RAM, so you'll have no problems with gaming and multimedia. There's a 4,600 mAh battery and IR-port for some multifunctional living room use, plus LG have even thrown in 1080p video and HDR support for its 5MP camera. There is also a built-in GPS chip to give this one an edge over the Wi-Fi only iPad mini, which is probably the only tablet in this class that can match it (and perhaps even beat it) in terms of looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's only a 16GB model available, so you should factor in the cost of a microSD card with your purchase as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of raw horsepower, no other tablet can currently beat the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It runs on a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. Then there's the 2560 x 1600 display resolution, which provides unparalleled sharpness in the 8.9-inch range. It also features an 8MP primary camera with a front-facer capable of 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, though, that all Kindle Fire's run on a highly customized Android version without support for Google Play, so you'll have to rely on the less-robust Amazon App Store for your app needs. It doesn't have microSD card support either, so you'd do well to consider the 32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if price is not a factor, then the Apple iPad mini 2 is definitely worth a look. The latest mini in Apple's popular iPad lineup boasts a 1536 x 2048 7.9-inch Retina display with a 4:3 aspect ratio, which provides more effective screen estate for reading and web browsing than 16:9 tablets. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of very functional and polished apps and games for even the most demanding among you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup. The Wi-Fi only version of the iPad mini also lacks a GPS chip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G midsize tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want to take your tablet on the go, then being able to rely on a 3G and/or LTE connection is almost a must. This section is for those of us that don't want to have to constantly bounce from WiFi network to WiFi network when we're out and about with our tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, comes the latest 8-inch entry from Lenovo, the Yoga 8. While its 1280 x 800 pixel display and quad-core MediaTek 1.2GHz processor may not be the best around, the Yoga 8 is one of the most affordable 8-inch tablets to offer 3G connectivity. Plus, its built-in 3-stage kickstand, 6,000 mAh battery and Dolby Digital Plus sound enhancement make it a great media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga 8 does have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only HSDPA bands 900 / 2100), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one. Also, if you get the more popular 16GB model you should get a microSD card as well, since the onboard memory will fill up quickly - especially if you plan on using it as a multimedia player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 makes our list here thanks in large part to its extensive LTE support. The 8-inch tablet otherwise has mediocre screen resolution of 800 x 1280, and gets beat out by the LG G Pad 8.3 in terms of performance as well, but the LG offering only has a WiFi-only variant available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 8.0 also has a wide array of connectivity extras, including an IR-port and an USB Host support. Plus, if you don't mind carrying an 8-inch device around there's also Samsung's excellent pressure-sensitive S-Pen for jotting things down or doodling away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9's LTE-enabled variant comes next. When it comes to pure processing power, no other tablet can currently beat its quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and Adreno 330 GPU alongside 2GB of RAM. The 2560 x 1600 display resolution also provides unparalleled sharpness in the 8.9-inch range. It also features an 8MP primary camera with a front-facer capable of 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, though, that all Kindle Fire's run on a highly customized Android version without support for Google Play, so you'll have to rely on the less-robust Amazon App Store for your app needs. It also doesn't have microSD card support, so we recommend at least the 32GB version if you decide to go for a Kindle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 again brings up the rear for buyers for whom cost is not an issue. Apple's latest mini has a 7.9" Retina display at 1536 x 2048px and a 4:3 aspect ratio. Apple's app store is second-to-none when it gets to tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support. It also has the benefit of having a built-in GPS chip, something with the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WiFi-only full-size tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you must have the best, full-size tablets is where it's at. With 10-inch and higher display sizes, you'll have plenty of screen estate for multitasking, and watching videos is also a more pleasant experience than you'll have on smaller screen sizes. If you're going this big then display fidelity plays a much bigger part, so we'll only be listing tablets with eye-popping pixel density in our full-size recommendations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is another offering from Archos, this time in the 9.7-inch flavor. The 97b Platinum HD features a very respectable 2048 x 1536 screen, which is the same diagonal and aspect ratio of the new Apple iPad Air. You'll find a decent 1.6GHz quad-core Cortex-A9 processor and 2GB of RAM, although again you'll have to pay for a microSD card to build on the very limited 8GB of internal memory. But you'll have more than enough money left over, as the 97b Platinum is still more affordable than most competitors' 8-inch offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus makes it to our WiFi-only list with its affordable yet capable Memo Pad FHD10 tablet. At 1920 x 1200 pixels, the 10-inch display provides great sharpness, and although the dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor isn't the fastest out there, the 2GB of RAM should help take some of the pressure off. There's also 1080p video recording for the camera, as well as some interesting colors available like Royal Blue and Vivid Pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's Nexus 10 offering by Samsung is now a year old, but has aged well thanks to its dual-core 1.7GHz Exynos 5250 chipset and excellent 2560 x 1600 pixel Super PLS TFT display. The resulting pixel density is just under 300 ppi. That and the 1080p video recording, Android 4.4 KitKat, and ample 9,000 mAh battery make it a very compelling value for its now reduced price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is no microSD card slot, so we recommend you go for the 32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Surface 2 tablet saw an October release this year alongside Windows 8.1 RT. While the 8.1 update did bring a few improvements, the RT version of Microsoft's mobile OS still retains its love-it-or-hate-it stigma. Nevertheless, the quad-core 1.7GHz Tegra 4 CPU, FullHD display, and solid construction with 2-stage kickstand make for quite a compelling offering, and the ample amount of storage is expandable via microSD. There's also the Full office suite that comes preinstalled, which offers the sort of productivity you will have a hard time finding on competing platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows RT offers a fluid user experience but it's nether Windows Phone, nor regular Windows, so there is not that big of a choice of apps and also the only way you get those is via the Windows Store. There are also many compelling tablets running the proper version of Windows on Intel's new Bay Trail architecture, such as the 8-inch Dell Venue 8 Pro or the 10.1-inch Asus Transformer Book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you plan on getting one of the (rather expensive) keyboard covers, we recommend the Type cover, as the Touch cover offers no tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia Tablet Z is one of the most stylish tablet offerings you'll see at this or any other size, with is dual-glass panel design and ultra-slim 6.9mm waistline. Under the hood there's a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU, and Sony is already working on an Android 4.4 KitKat update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively small 6,000mAh battery is the only real downside, as you may not get much time between charges, but battery life is still passable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're big on typing, then Asus has you covered again with its latest Transformer Pad TF701T. Basically a MeMo Pad on steroids, the TF701T comes with an ultra-crisp 2560 x 1600 pixel screen, a hefty quad-core 1.9 GHz Tegra 4 processor, and 32GB of expandable storage. More importantly, the Transformer earns its moniker by being the only tablet that also comes with a keyboard dock as part of the retail package, making it a great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 brings an incredibly sharp 2560 x 1600 pixel display, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core Snapdragon 800 to the table. Samsung's great pressure-sensitive S-Pen offers something other tablets simply can't match. The pleasant leather-like textured plastic back from the Note 3 has also made its way to its elder sibling and it works great visually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if price is not a factor, then the Apple iPad Air brings an ultra-sharp display alongside Apple's proprietary A7 chipset. The iPad Air features a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is arguably the more user-friendly aspect for web browsing or reading and also offers more screen real estate for the same diagonal. Thanks to Apple's extensive app store, there's no shortage of functional and innovative apps and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air does not come with a microSD card slot, so we recommend you get at least the 32GB version despite its exorbitant markup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3G/4G full-size tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Large or not, sometimes you just want to take your tablet out. This section is for those of us that don't want to have to constantly bounce from one WiFi network to the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's Yoga 10 tablet comes first in this section as it's the most affordable decent 10-inch tablet currently available that also offer 3G connectivity. Although its 1280 x 800 pixel resolution stretches a bit thin on such a large display, at least the quad-core 1.2GHz processor has little trouble dealing with it. There's also a built-in 3-stage kickstand, a 9,000 mAh battery and dual front stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus for multimedia viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga 10 does have fairly limited 3G network connectivity (it supports only HSDPA bands 900 / 2100), so be sure it has the right coverage for your area if you decide to get one. Also, if you get the more popular 16GB model you should get a microSD card as well, since the onboard memory will fill up quickly - especially if you plan on using it as a media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's first tablet offering, the Nokia Lumia 2520, was revealed this October running Windows 8.1 RT. With a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, a FullHD screen and a solid unibody construction, the Lumia 2520 might as well turn the prospects of Windows RT for the better. It's also got Dolby headphone sound enhancement and is one of the first tablets to support USB 3.0 with USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's some capable hardware, but despite it and the presence of LTE, the Lumia 252 is priced the same as the Wi-Fi only iPad Air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you have got to remember that even with Nokia's own software goodies added to the mix, Windows RT has a hard time competing with its rivals in anything but office-related productivity tasks. And the situation is unlikely to change any soon as all other major manufacturers and Microsoft partners have abandoned Windows RT and have turned their attention to making tablets running the full-featured Windows (thanks to Intel's Atom Bay Trail Z3xxx chipsets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE version of the stylish Sony's Xperia Tablet Z makes its way into this section as one of the more affordable top-tier 10-inchers. You get a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU, and Sony is commited to bringing an Android 4.4 KitKat update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition's LTE brings the incredibly sharp 2560 x 1600 pixel display, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core Snapdragon 800 performance of the Wifi-only variant, and bumps up the clock speed to 2.3GHz. Also an LTE exclusive is the Adreno 330 GPU and 1080p@60fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's great pressure-sensitive S-Pen offers something other tablets simply can't match. The pleasant leather-like textured plastic back from the Note 3 has also made its way to its elder sibling and it works great visually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if money is of no object, the Apple iPad Air brings LTE connectivity and an ultra-sharp display alongside Apple's proprietary A7 chipset. Having access to Apple's App store, the Air get to choose between the largest selection of tablet-optimized apps in existence which is certainly its key weapon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled version offers an immensely wide LTE band support. It also has the benefit of having a built-in GPS chip, something with the Wi-Fi only version lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air does not come with a microSD card slot, so you'd either have to pay close to ?700 for the 32GB version or constantly find yourself lacking enough storage.</paragraph>
