			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android devices come from all walks of life, but in each generation there is a "chosen one". In 2012, it's the Nexus 4 and, as an overall package, this is probably the best Google has ever delivered. Yet, by a mean twist of fate, it has the most formidable opposition of any Nexus phone so far. Even with Google's official backing, the purebred Nexus 4 is not guaranteed a win against the Samsung Galaxy S III - the Android smartphone of the season, which has been selling in numbers that make Black Friday look like a slow day at the grocery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hook of the Nexus 4 is flagship specs at a hard-to-beat price. It has a top-notch screen and chipset, but some corners had to be cut to make the budget (the non-expandable inbuilt memory is particularly painful).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a clear objective but dethroning the Galaxy S III is a huge challenge. That beast of a droid has set the user experience bar quite high. Of course Samsung just cannot match Google's aggressive pricing, but the 5-month market advantage has made the Galaxy S III a little more affordable. The flip side of the coin is that the Galaxy S III hardware is no longer cream of the crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 on the other hand, has availability issues - it runs out in minutes. Another thing is that it costs $350 only in countries where the Play Store is available too, elsewhere it gets quite steep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's follow proper championship protocol and go over the highlights of each contender while they wait for the bell in their corners .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S III over Nexus 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 is using tech that will only go into full swing next year. The Galaxy S III in turn will inevitably start showing its age. Our experience with the two phones though is that the Samsung flagship is not to be easily dismissed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software is a different story - Google's approach is one of purist simplicity, while Samsung throws everything its R&amp;D department has cooking up in the labs (and those guys are pretty prolific).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They say the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but before we get to the actual experience with the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S III, we do have to look at their bits and parts first. The hardware checkup is first on our list.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy S III were signed by different makers (LG and Samsung, respectively), their designs have a lot more in common than a casual observer would think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some sort of continuity was consciously sought and the Nexus 4 looks a lot like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus from the front. The hyperglazed plastic of the Galaxy and the Gorilla Glass 2 back of the Nexus 4 feel pretty similar to the touch, even though the Google phone has the upper hand in terms of durability. On the other hand getting the back panel of the Galaxy S III replaced is easy, whereas doing so on the Nexus 4 would be expensive and time-consuming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opinions on looks are pretty subjective but we'll try to summarize the general feel of the two phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III comes in multiple color versions and the plastic either has a wood grain-like texture or is a solid color (the plastic used is not everyone's cup of tea). The curved shape makes it quite comfortable, but the Galaxy S III isn't the most exciting-looking phone in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 on the other hand is a bit more angular and goes for the glass-and-steel look, which is quite popular. The dotted pattern on the back comes alive as you tilt the phone and we think it looks great, though if you want to be negative about it, you can say it's a little too flashy, with a disco-ball sort of gloss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S III are virtually the same height and width and practically the same weight too. The S III is a bit thinner, a feeling that's enhanced by its curvy lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is where the two phones are vastly different in terms of specs. The Nexus 4 uses a 4.7" True HD IPS Plus screen by LG with WXGA resolution (768 x 1280) and 15:9 aspect ratio, while the Galaxy S III goes for a Samsung-made 4.8" Super AMOLED screen of 720p resolution and 16:9 aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two displays have virtually the same size (the S III has an advantage of just under 1%) despite the difference in screen diagonal due to the different aspect ratios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to note is that both displays are protected by Gorilla Glass 2, which is curved. The curvature is more prominent on the Nexus 4, which is great as swipes starting from outside the screen are important to the handling of this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones take a different approach to hardware controls. The Samsung Galaxy S III goes for the company's traditional hardware and capacitive keys setup. The Nexus 4 follows Google design guidelines and uses on-screen keys instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is important both because they provide different controls (Menu / Home / Back for the S III and Back / Home / Task switcher for the Nexus 4) and because the on-screen keys make the effective aspect ratio of the Nexus 4 closer to 14:9, making for a squarer image and less real estate for most of the content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature on the front is the notification light - both have RGB LEDs (so it can glow in any color you like). The light on the Nexus 4 is below the screen, where a hardware home key would normally be, while the one on the S III is in the top left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else seems to be positioned pretty much the same. Both phones have a volume rocker on the left and a power/lock key on the right, a microUSB port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack on top, two microphones (top and bottom), an 8MP camera with LED flash and loudspeaker at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nexus 4 does differ slightly - it has a microSIM card slot, which requires a SIM eject tool to open. There's no way to access the battery and no slot for a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III has all those things under the removable back cover. From there you have access to the battery, microSIM card slot (which is blocked by the battery) and the microSD card slot (which is hot-swappable). Swapping SIM cards on the go is much easier on the S III as it doesn't require any special tools. The expandable memory is another clear advantage of the Galaxy smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones are powered by 2100mAh batteries and we'll have a look at the battery life in the pages to come. The Nexus 4 has Qi wireless charging enabled. The official Orb charger isn't out yet, but you can use any Qi-compatible charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the two phones are virtually the same size, their handling is slightly different. The Samsung Galaxy S III feels thinner (andt is actually thinner, but the rounded edges make the difference more tangible) and it feels lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 feels a bit heavier and a bit thicker (due to its more angular sides). Still, that's just the perception of it, the pocketability of both phones is the same. The Nexus 4 allows a better grip and, overall, has a more pleasant, solid feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. The Nexus 4 is sturdier, though replacing damaged back panel on the Galaxy S III is fast and cheap. The expandable storage, easy access to the microSIM card and swappable battery weigh in its favor too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two major things to consider when you rate a phone's screen quality: how well you can see what's on the display and how good it looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Google Nexus 4 and Samsung Galaxy S III have Gorilla Glass 2 protecting their 4.7-or-so-inch displays, but this is where similarities end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 has a True HD IPS Plus LCD screen with a WXGA (768 x 1280) resolution and full RGB stripe. The Galaxy S III uses a Super AMOLED screen with 720 x 1280 resolution on a PenTile matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LCDs are typically brighter and the Nexus 4 does indeed put out nearly double the lumens of the Galaxy S III when both are set at 100% brightness. The strengths of AMOLEDs lie in perfect blacks, which push contrast to infinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast of the Nexus 4 is finite but very high - 1341:1. In practice, 1000+ contrast is good enough unless you're in a very dark environment. The black levels are pretty impressive - comparable to a Nokia Lumia 920 or an Apple iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem that the Nexus 4 screen has is that it's quite reflective - more reflective than the screen of the LG Optimus G, which was less than perfect to begin with. So, bright light greatly reduces the perceived contrast, affecting the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III on the other hand is one of the best performers we've seen in this category - its screen is not very bright, which hurts sunlight legibility, but the low reflectivity keeps things legible even in the brightest sun.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With that out of the way, let's talk image quality. We already mentioned that the Super AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S III uses a PenTile matrix, meaning it only has two subpixels per pixel, while the Nexus 4 has three subpixels in each of its pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two screens are pretty close in terms of pixel density (318 ppi for the Nexus vs. 306 for the Galaxy), but the subpixel density is a whole different story. The Nexus 4 has 56% higher subpixel density than the Galaxy S III. While at these levels PenTile isn't nearly as noticeable as it used to be, if you look closely you'll see that the Nexus 4 has the sharper screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to color rendering, AMOLEDs tend to oversaturate colors and the Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S III is no exception. Samsung has provided a setting to control the color rendering, so you can tweak it to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 doesn't have such a setting, but its colors look natural and pleasing, so we won't complain. One area where we see room for improvement is viewing angles - the IPS Plus tech keeps color shifting to a minimum (though it's still noticeable), but there's a pretty sharp decrease in contrast when you view the screen at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that came up during our Nexus 4 review is that the LG Optimus G - the base on which the Nexus is built - uses LG-sourced software tweaks to improve the image quality, which are not available to the Google phone. Images drawn to the screen are sharpened and there are adjustments to the color too, so the same image will have more visible detail on the Optimus G than on the Nexus 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not like the Nexus 4 has a bad screen, but it miffs us to know that it could have been even better with the more advanced image rendering techniques of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Google Nexus 4. The screen is bright and with good contrast and is sharper than the PenTile Super AMOLED. We just wish LG shared the secret sauce that made the Optimus G screen better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Simply comparing battery capacities would be largely inconclusive. Both the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S III have 2100mAh juice packs, but their battery life is quite different as we found out from our tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick side note first. The S III uses a standard Li-Ion battery, while the Nexus 4 has a Li-Po battery manufactured by LG Chem. LG promises that it will last more charge cycles than a traditional battery before it starts to degrade. That's good to know, because putting a fresh battery in the Nexus is no easy task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice calls are just one of the many features of a modern smartphone, but still an important one. The Google Nexus 4 posts one of the best times we've seen - just over 14 hours of talking before the battery runs dry. The Samsung Galaxy S III is not bad either with a bit over 10 hours of talk time, but the Nexus has a nearly 40% advantage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our web browsing test, the Galaxy S III managed the respectable 6 and a half hours. The Nexus 4 managed 2 hours less. Keep in mind that we do the test over Wi-Fi and an LTE connection will drain the battery even quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that the Nexus 4 has rather underwhelming web browser benchmarks and software optimizations might improve performance, which in turn will lighten the load on the four hungry Krait cores. The Galaxy S III may be a good reference - it gained over an hour by going from ICS to Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other than web browsing, watching videos is the other area where a big screen is of a big benefit. If you're on a long commute or on a plane, for example, the Galaxy S III will last for nearly 9 and a half hours before the battery hits 10% (many phones refuse to play video under that threshold). That's enough for quite the movie marathon on a long transatlantic flight (note: we do the test in offline mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 is one of the worst performers in this category - it only took 5 hours before the battery reading showed 10%. We suspect the poor performance might be due to the relatively poor codec support - Google just doesn't consider that as a priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you probably won't watch a movie on the Galaxy S III for 10 hours straight, you can watch a three hour movie and have plenty of battery left over. Doing the same on the Nexus 4 will leave you with less than 50% charge, even if you started with a fully charged battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we tally the numbers and take standby efficiency into account, the Samsung Galaxy S III lasts a bit over two full days on a single charge in a usage pattern involving an hour each of calling, web browsing and watching video every day. The S III showed nearly double the standby efficiency of its competitor, too, which helped it achieve an important victory here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>By comparison, the Google Nexus 4 lasts only 32 hours - it could get you through two work days, but you'll have to plug it in the second night. It will do great if all you do is voice calls, but with a 4.7" WXGA screen and S4 Pro chipset, you'll probably want to do some web browsing or watch HD video (we test with SD video) and that's just the kind of thing that brings the battery down quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. It lost the talk time test, but with its time of over 10 hours is more than enough. In the other tests it beat the Nexus 4 outright.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - stock vs. custom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is the chameleon of the smartphone world - each version gives you a base set of features and makers are free to build on it however they like. This is pretty clear when you look at the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While both run Jelly Bean - 4.2.1 in the case of the Nexus and 4.1.2 for the Galaxy - they look and feel different, not to mention have different features and skills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into the details, check out our quick hands-on videos to see both phones in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the first thing you see. The Galaxy S III used to have one of the most customizable lockscreens - you can put shortcuts there, an info ticker (for news, stocks or Facebook), a dual clock and weather info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google topped that with JB 4.2 - they introduced widgets to the lockscreen. So, you can have all the functionality that the S III offers and more. There are some limitations though - the S III piles all the info on one screen, while the stock 4.2 lockscreen shows only one widget at a time. Also, there are only three widgets available by default, though you can grab new ones from the Play Store. And finally, you only get two shortcuts - camera and Google Now (a third-party widget can easily fix that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like what Google did with the lockscreen on Android 4.2, but we're not so sure about the new toggles in the notification area. They cover the basics - screen brightness and auto-rotation, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, cell signal strength and airplane mode, battery info and a settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's great but the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth icons are just shortcuts to the respective settings screen, not power toggles. And the brightness shortcut brings up a slider, so to change the brightness you need to do a two-finger swipe, tap the icon and then set the brightness to the desired level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's custom power toggles in the notification area are quicker - they turn, say, Wi-Fi on and off on a tap and bring up the settings on a long press. The brightness slider is right there, so that's one click less to set. Also, keeping both toggles and notifications in the same place is simpler and it makes sense on a 4.7-4.8" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.2 changed nothing about the homescreen, so the Nexus 4 brings no surprises - 5 homescreens, a fixed Google search bar on the top, four customizable shortcuts in the dock. The drawer holds both app shortcuts and widgets separated into two tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's approach with the Galaxy S III is quite similar, though, again, it offers more customization options. You can have up to 7 homescreens (and less than 5 if you like) and you can easily rearrange them. The drawer uses a tabbed layout for both shortcuts and widgets, but allows you to hide apps and switch to an alphabetized grid, a custom grid or a list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that both the lockscreen and the launcher (which is the homescreen + drawer) can be replaced with a 3rd party app, so you're not tied to a particular combo if you buy the Nexus or the Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that the launcher can't change - with anything but a custom ROM - is the task switcher. The Nexus 4 uses a vanilla switcher accessed from the on-screen button. It's a thumbnail list of recent apps that you can swipe to terminate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung uses the same switcher (accessed upon a press and hold of the Home key) with a little twist - there are three buttons at the bottom, which launch the Task manager, Google Now or clear all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another way to access Google Now is a long press on the Menu key. On the Nexus 4 you press and hold the on-screen Home key and drag (similar to the unlocking gesture). The S III has Samsung's S Voice (double tap the Home key), which has mostly been superseded by Now though it can still do a couple of things that Now can't - e.g. toggling Wi-Fi on/off or snapping a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the latest update to the Samsung Galaxy S III brought something that Google has not yet implemented (though it's certainly being considered) - MultiView. It runs two apps side by side for the ultimate multitasking, and the powerful quad-core processor makes it look so easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only supported apps work with MultiView (root users have ways to get around that), but the list is quite comprehensive - Browser and Chrome, Gmail and Email, SMS app, Talk and ChatOn, Facebook, Gallery, Video player and YouTube, Maps and Polaris Office. The Music player is not supported (though there are controls for that in the notification area).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two apps you pick will split the screen in half by default, but you can drag the divider to adjust it at any time to any position. There are also two buttons that allow you to swap the windows or expand one of them full-screen (essentially turning off MultiView).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MultiView greatly improves multitasking - for example you can chat with someone while browsing, without having to constantly switch between apps. Or you could chat with two people at once. Or edit a document while keeping some reference material in the browser. There are many possibilities - especially now that Samsung has published the API and third-party apps can join in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even splitting the screen to watch a video while doing something works better than using the Pop Up Play feature, which floats the video window around (that's more of a "look at what quad-core can do" feature than a useful one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. We love what Google did with the lockscreen, but everywhere else the Galaxy S III was more customizable and had more features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 uses a Qualcomm APQ 8064 Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset, which packs the new generation Krait CPU cores and the new generation Adreno 320 GPU. The Samsung Galaxy S III meanwhile relies on Cortex-A9 CPU cores and Mali-400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out, the older design holds up very well against the powerful newcomer and wins several rounds, though as we've noted before, it's more because of optimization than having comparable raw power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the CPU performance. The Google Nexus 4 posts a slow time in Benchmark Pi - slower than both the Galaxy S III and the LG Optimus G. It wins out in Linpack, but not by a big margin - it's on the level of the Galaxy Note II, which uses the same chipset as the S III but clocked higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 puts the Galaxy S III above the Optimus G, but the Nexus 4 came out on top.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant both test overall system performance and their opinions are split - AnTuTu puts the Nexus 4 comfortably on top, while Quadrant rated the Samsung Galaxy S III higher and put the Nexus at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to GPU performance, the newer architecture has a clear advantage - it offered nearly 75% higher framerate in the off-screen GLBenchmark 2.5 test (1080p resolution). It practically matched the iPhone 5, which uses some of the most powerful GPU cores around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, the off-screen GLBenchmark 2.1 test (720p resolution) showed lower framerate for the Nexus 4 than the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.1 Egypt (720p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 comes with Chrome out of the box, while the Samsung Galaxy S III uses the stock Android Browser with some TouchWiz tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of pure JavaScript performance, Chrome on the Nexus 4 is well behind the stock browser on the Galaxy S III. The Nexus performed better in BrowserMark 2 (a JavaScript and HTML5 test), beating the S III by a nice margin, though it again lagged behind the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo, another compound web browser test, puts the S III near the top and the Nexus 4 at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After all these benchmarks, we have no solid answer to the question of which phone is faster. On average, the Google Nexus 4 is faster - CPU benchmarks favor it (especially in multithreaded tasks) and the GPU victory was pretty decisive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results seem very dependent on the software, however. The Samsung Galaxy S III won its fair share of benchmarks. Whatever modifications Samsung have made to the browser seem to have really boosted performance and GLBenchmark 2.1 reported a higher framerate for the S III than the Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, both phones are powerful enough to handle any task they're given. But the Nexus 4 has room for improvement, the Optimus G (which differs from the Nexus by software only) beat it in several key benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Google Nexus 4. It may not have won outright, but benchmarks leaned in its favor overall and the S4 Pro chipset has potential that can be unlocked with a software update.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III has a reputation to live up to (the S II had one of the best mobile phone cameras of its time), while the Google Nexus 4 isn't burdened with such high expectations, despite the move to 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google still managed to cause excitement with one of the coolest camera features we've seen recently - the Street View-inspired Photo Spheres. The S III's camera app, along with the rest of the software, is loaded to the brim with all sorts of features - but it only does "regular" panos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a quick look at what each camera has to offer. The Nexus 4 brought another major improvement - the touch anywhere radial menu. We're big fans of quick controls in the browser and this is the same except it works everywhere on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's great on two counts. First, a tap and a drag is all you have to do to change, say, exposure compensation, while that will take several taps on the Galaxy S III, even if you do pin the exposure compensation setting to the left viewfinder bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Second, it's unobtrusive - you can use the circle in the upper right corner to operate the settings in the traditional way, plus the taps for the menu don't get in the way of the taps for touch focus or the swipes for getting to the camera roll. Speaking of the camera roll, we also really like the swipe to delete feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as features go, the Nexus 4 offers all the necessities though advanced users might be left wanting more. There's Scenes and HDR mode, white balance and exposure compensation, flash mode and geotagging, along with touch focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional Panorama mode is still available, but Photo Sphere steals the show. It combines accelerometer and gyroscope readings to guide you through the process, which is quite simple - you aim for the dots and the Nexus 4 handles the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III uses a traditional smartphone camera UI - a column on the right for the major controls (still/video toggle, shutter key, Gallery shortcut) and a left column for settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left column is customizable and you can put four of the most frequently used features. The fifth icon is the settings shortcut, which takes you through a sprawling system of menus and submenus. Don't get us wrong - we love having all these options at our disposal, but getting to all of them can be slow, even daunting for beginners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of features is really extensive: Scenes, HDR, geotagging, burst shot mode, face detection and smile shutter, various automatic modes (best face, best photo, beauty shot), effects and social features like Share shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a list of manual controls too: exposure compensation, white balance, contrast, ISO, focus metering and auto-focus modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Galaxy S III can't match the Photo Sphere feature, its own panorama mode is quite good. But there are a number of features that the Nexus doesn't even come close to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Burst shot takes multiple photos in quick succession (3.3fps). You can use Best photo and Best face to pick the keeps. Best photo automatically picks the best of 8, while Best face keeps track of faces and will stich a composite photo with the best facial expression for each person. It picks each expression automatically (avoiding shots where the person is blinking), but you can manually select a face too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III can snap full-res photos during video recording. The Nexus 4 can do the same, but its photos come out in 1080p resolution (2MP) - basically a frame from the video and not of much use. The Galaxy S III photos are shot at 6MP resolution, the maximum in 16:9 mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the social aspects of the camera - if you've taught the phone what your friends look like (the gallery automatically detects faces and you can link them to contacts), the phone will recognize them immediately after you take a photo and you can tap on their face to get options for sending the photo to the person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To recap, the interface on the Google Nexus 4 is really convenient. It's easy to pick up and very fast once you get used to it. The camera is a bit light on features though, even with Photo Sphere (which will be a great way to wow your Google Plus friends).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III on the other hand offers plenty of features, though it will take you a while to learn which does what and find the best 4 shortcuts to put in the left column. Photo Sphere is the biggest omission from the feature set, but that could arrive in an update, as a third-party app or even unofficially from XDA-Developers or the like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S III have 8MP cameras, but that's not to say they produce photos with the same quality. Actually, there's no way around it, the Galaxy has the better camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos taken with the Nexus 4 have a lot of noise in them, even after noise reduction, and the phone gets pretty aggressive with the sharpening to bring back the lost detail. The results are especially visible in the sky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are fairly accurate (saturation isn't artificially boosted like on most other phones), though the white balance can be a bit off some times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos from the Galaxy S III have much less noise and a lot more detail in them. The S III also has better dynamic range and loses less detail in properly-lit areas. Colors are oversaturated but not out of proportion, and white balance is good (may be a bit on the cold side for some people).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the full resolution samples for the pixel peepers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For even more of the same, head over to our Photo quality comparison tool to see how both phones handle our standardized charts.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We also tested the HDR feature of both phones to find that their approaches differ. The Nexus 4 goes for wider dynamic range and tries too hard to bring out detail in both the highlights and the shadows. The resulting noise in the shadows is quite evident though and the contrast drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III is more conservative and mostly adds detail to the highlights, shadows are barely changed. It resolves more detail than the Nexus in the bright areas (especially the sky on a cloudy day). You're not going to notice much improvement in the dark areas (but no noise either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice between the overstated HDR effect in the Nexus 4 shots and the gentle processing in the Galaxy S III is a matter of personal preference. Have a look at the crop below, which incorporates highlights and shadows (we shrunk the photos to 25% before making the crops to fit more of the scene).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view the full resolution shots, which give you a better look at the captured detail and noise. By the way, the Galaxy S III saves both an HDR and a regular copy, which is great if you don't like how the HDR image turned out. The Nexus 4 saves only the HDR shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the panorama modes as well. We used both the regular panorama and the Photo Sphere modes on the Nexus 4, while the Galaxy S III takes part only with the regular panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparing just those panoramas, the Galaxy S III has a clear advantage - it offers double the vertical resolution, not to mention more detail and better dynamic range (which is important as panoramas often cover both well-lit and shadowy areas). The S III continued shooting until we did a full turn, while the Nexus stopped halfway through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Photo Sphere is composed of many photos and the amount of captured detail improves considerably over the normal panorama mode of the Nexus 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating personal Street View-like shots is great but we should warn against several disadvantages. First off, shooting a Photo Sphere takes quite a bit longer than a regular panorama, at least if you want to complete the sphere (you don't have to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing is that when viewing the resulting image in a regular photo viewer, objects in the photo appear distorted. You need a special viewer on your phone / computer - it works just fine if you upload it to Google Plus, but if you email the JPG to someone, they're unlikely to have a spherical panorama viewer installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full resolution panorama samples. You'll notice that neither phone managed a perfect stitch and there are some obvious artifacts, not to mention distortion throughout the image.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. Overall better image quality and a bigger set of features outweigh the sleeker UI and the Photo Sphere feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 shoots 1080p@30fps videos and so does the Samsung Galaxy S III, but the quality advantage remains in hands of the Samsung flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 doesn't help its case by storing videos in an MP4 file with a bitrate of 12Mbps, which is pretty low for FullHD video. The compression leads to loss of detail, though having seen the still camera perform, we suspect the level of resolved detail wasn't that great to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 also records mono sound (100Kbps, 48kHz), despite having two microphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III uses MP4 files too but the bitrate is higher - 17Mbps - and it shows. The difference in detail is especially visible on the asphalt, but the rest of the image appears sharper too. The colors are a bit oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S III camera has a wider field of view, allowing it to fit more in the frame than the Nexus 4 (and it still wins in terms of fine detail). The Galaxy phone also features touch focus, which works even during video recording and there's a helpful button to go back to continuous autofocus if you like. The Nexus 4 relies solely on continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do have one complaint about the S III videos though - quality is not constant and looks as if the bitrate occasionally drops before going back to normal in the next instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo sound recording (130Kbps, 48kHz) marks another win for the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an 100% crop we made from video stills to illustrate the difference in image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples we shot with both phones:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Video quality compare is worth a look too. The low-light image shows that the Galaxy S III has a clear advantage in quality when shooting in the dark - its videos have more detail and less noise than the Nexus 4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Google Nexus 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy S III in our Video compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick crop of just the low-light part of the video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. It produces better videos in good and bad light and it records better sound to boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We usually don't specifically cover connectivity in this kind of comparison articles, but the two contenders here call for an exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have quad-band 2G connectivity and quad-band 3G connectivity with HSPA. The Nexus 4 supports DC-HSDPA, which doubles the download speeds if the carrier supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't have LTE, at least not officially. You can enable it, but only one band is supported and (depending on your region) it might or might not be the right one. So, you shouldn't take LTE for granted when buying the Nexus 4 - most likely it won't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I9300 Galaxy S III does not support LTE, though there's a dedicated I9305 version that does. It's tailored to support the networks in region where it is sold and if ultra-fast mobile data rates are your priority might just be worth the extra investment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local wireless connectivity is almost identical - dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are all supported. Both phones offer more advanced features too - DLNA, Android Beam (file transfer over NFC) and Miracast, a wireless TV-Out standard. Miracast requires a dongle that hooks up to the TV though newer TVs might have it built-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support HD TV-Out with the proper dongle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III also has USB On-The-Go support, which means you can connect various USB peripherals - mice, keyboards and USB storage. The Nexus 4 doesn't have OTG, it seems to be a hardware limitation (it worked on the Galaxy Nexus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones also do TV-out via the USB port, though they use different technologies. The Galaxy S III has an MHL-enabled USB, whereas the Nexus 4 uses a SlimPort USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Galaxy S III has USB OTG, while the Nexus 4 has rudimentary LTE support. Other than that, the two phones are too similar to pick a definitive winner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two contenders are pretty evenly matched in terms of audio quality. They both have nicely clean output and equal volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When used with an active external amplifier, the Galaxy S III has a slight advantage, but you'd probably need to do lab tests to detect it. What's more important is that both are doing pretty great, with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very little changes when you plug in a pair of headphones - the two smartphones still deliver great results and this time the Nexus 4 is even closer to the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S III. Its advantage is very hard to detect with a naked ear, though, so this win doesn't count for much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 came with improved loudspeaker performance compared to the Galaxy Nexus and it's level with the Samsung Galaxy S III. Both received Good marks in our test, with the Nexus having a slight edge in ringtone performance, while the S III does slightly better for voice audio. You can read more about how we do the test over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. There's no tangible difference between the loudspeakers of the two phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When Google announced that the next Nexus will pack four Krait cores and an upgraded camera, all for the price of $300 ($350 for the more sensible, 16GB version), there was a short moment when it seemed that everyone after an Android phone would be crazy not to get a Nexus 4. It was better and cheaper than anything else out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then reality interjected. Users realized the limited storage would be felt sooner rather than later, even in the "big" version. The vanilla Android just isn't everyone's cup of tea, the image quality isn't quite up to par, and there are a number of other things that are not ideal (non-removable battery for one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, at $350 off-contract there's nothing that can compete with it (unless you're in China and know what Xiaomi Mi-Two is). The bad news is the price is not guaranteed. Countries where the phone isn't offered through the Play Store can expect prices in the &#x20ac;500+ range (and that's more than what the S III costs). It doesn't quite help either that the Nexus 4 is almost chronically out of stock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III has been on store shelves for months now and its price is fairly level across markets. It's also more flexible in terms of internal storage and has an LTE version, plus a home-baked launcher that easily beats even newer Android 4.2 in terms of features offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its weak spot is that software updates will come slower, but Samsung has piled on a ton of exclusive features to make up for it. The Nexus 4 did manage to score big points for its excellent lockscreen and Photo Spheres feature, too, but overall the Galaxy S III software package is far more compelling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have vibrant developer communities that will provide you with a steady stream of custom ROMs if the software of the two isn't quite to your liking (or if Samsung is taking too long to push out the next Android version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's probably not what you expected to hear, but the Google Nexus 4 will probably end up most popular with people looking for a mid-range Android. It's a class above mid-rangers but matches them on price - in short, you get far more than what you paid for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't quite cut it for power users though - a high-end 3D game (the kind you'll want to play on a big HD screen and powerful GPU) can easily eat up a couple of gigabytes of storage and so can HD movies. And the camera just isn't a match for some of the competing 8MP shooters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III has a very good camera and its older chipset still has enough oomph for modern games (not to mention that its wider availability encourages developers to optimize their titles). Storage expansion is cheap and easy too - and you can opt for larger built-in memory. The removable battery lasts longer to boot. Then there's MultiView, which lets you put the big screen and quad-core processor to good multitasking use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The holidays will soon be over and we expect the Google Nexus 4's supply to get back on track. If you have $350 in your pocket and are looking for a great Android phone, you can grab the Nexus 4 and tell Google "Nice doing business with you. Thank you very much!" That's if you can get it off the Play Store, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III makes up for the price gap between it and the Nexus by beating it in several key areas - it has a better camera, plenty of software tricks up its sleeve (we'd go ahead and call smart dial and Smart Stay must-haves) and more battery life. Plus, depending on where you live, there might not be a price difference at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Money shouldn't be of utmost importance it seems when it gets down to two of Android's finest. We enjoyed every moment and still cannot quite make up our mind. There're people on our team who would go for the Nexus even if they have to pay above the Play Store price. However, the diehard Android users among us tend to side with the Galaxy S III. There're some undecided but none who didn't care. We can bet that even people reading this on Retina displays are paying attention, even if they try to look like they have no dog in this fight.</paragraph>
