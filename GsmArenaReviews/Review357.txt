			<paragraph>A gorgeous outlook and high-tech functions are literally breathing from Nokia E65. Yet, is it really so brilliant to be worth the investment?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle> Main disadvantages <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 is an attractive slider smartphone powered by the Symbian OS. It offers Wi-Fi capability and has 3G support. Its extensive software equipment is an apparent necessity, while its built-in 2 megapixel camera and dedicated keys for conference call management are delightful extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 weighs 115 grams mostly due to the materials it is made of and the hardware hidden inside its body. Yet, it could still be considered a medium-weight phone if compared to the 134 gram Nokia N80. At the same time, its dimensions are surprisingly comfortable for a smartphone: 105 x 49 x 16 mm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Beauty rules the parade <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is the very first time in the history of the ?business E class? models that Nokia resorts to a slider construction. In this sense the most eager to upgrade with a Nokia E65 purchase will probable be Nokia E50 or E60 owners, as these models lack a full-function QWERTY keypad (unlike Nokia E61 or E70) and could therefore be used as standard phones rather than communicators. Nonetheless, business communicators fans should not be sad either as Nokia has placed a ?Coming soon? label on two other models - Nokia E61i and Nokia E90</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Nokia E61i and Nokia E90  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Side viewed Nokia E65 looks like a rectangular trapezoid. The bottom side is perpendicular to the base, while in the top area there is an expressed beveling. The label ?Nokia? is probably the only missing element on the colorful body of the testing piece delivered to our office. I doubt any other manufacturer would have dared to use brown shade on a high-tech, high-class device as the one we are presenting you today (Nokia calls it ?mocca brown?). No matter how fashionable at the moment, brown has never been common on the mobile market. The situation with the alternative red version of Nokia E65 is no different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Nokia E65  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter how much or less attractive the two above mentioned designs seem to you, there is no doubt that, at first glance at least, the brown Nokia E65 looks very stylish. This is due to the combination of dark nuances and mirror images on its front side. While the dark plastic areas are intensely matt, both the display and the surrounding area are highly prone to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The phone in a hand ? details on the leather-like back cover  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us make one more remark on the materials the phone is elaborated of. Its rear plate is made of plastic, which strongly resembles leather. Even though the leather design is not so attractive, it brilliantly fulfills its basic purpose: preventing user?s hand from sliding.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Absolute solidity <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s now have a closer look at the sliding mechanism. Unfortunately, we are not able to give you an opinion of a long-time user. As recent users of Nokia E65, however, we have come to like its sliding mechanism. Even more, we consider it a top-class one. Unlike the mechanism itself, sliding process does hide some difficulties: when the phone lies in your palm, you will find it hard to curve your thumb to slide the phone open to the bottom edge. At the same time, given the absence of a bulge on the front cover, where to rest your thumb, you need to either push sideways or press on the keys or the glossy display surface in the worst case. The closing process is pretty much the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The phone opened ? details of the sliding mechanism  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phone parts hold very firmly. However, this solidity seems to be directly related to stronger resistance showed by the sliding mechanism. It also seems that the top cover of the phone skids over the internal keypad when slid out and simultaneously pressed on, which is not good. Nokia E65 features two rails ? one for each side of the phone, whose aim is to maintain the sliding part in vertical position. You can see them from behind as well as hear them whenever the device is opened (quiet friction).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Size comparison with Nokia N73  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, Nokia has never been brilliant in constructing sliders of perfectly sticking parts. This drawback is often a direct consequence of sliding camera covers and is fortunately not present in Nokia E65. Except for the slight deflection when opened, the phone gives a strong impression of firmness. Besides, as you all know, pedantry is our job and this is a tester phone, so do not take each critical remark we make to heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As I am looking at the bottom of Nokia E65, I cannot help but give out a sad ?ah?. The phone only features a Pop-Port, even when Nokia has recently established a practice of equipping its models with a miniUSB connector and a 2.5 mm jack. Right next to the Pop Port you will find a narrowed charger connector (the travel AC-4 charger is part of the retail package).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Right stronger than left <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the phone?s left side is quite poor of control elements, its right side is full of them: a loudspeaker, a voice note/voice dial key, a ?stylus? key for work with text, and a slightly elevated volume button. According to us, however, placing the volume and the text keys on the opposite side would have been a far happier solution, as they wouldn?t have to be so small as they are. Now they are a real trouble for users with bigger fingers as their management requires that you stick your finger a bit under the phone?s surface. The button for profile activation is situated on the top of the phone and is not so easy to press it with one hand only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Pop-Port ? switch-on button ? side keys and battery ? microSD slot  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infrared port is accessed only when you slide up the top part of the phone. The rear plate mainly constitutes of the battery cover; above it are the camera lens and a bit further ? the company logo. Inside Nokia E65 you will find a BL-5F battery of 1000 mAh capacity. As to battery life, the official Nokia site quotes 3 ? 6 hours of call time in GSM, 1.8 to 2.5 hours in WCDMA, and 2.2 ? 3 hours in VoIP, while on stand-by the device should be able to stay on between 7 and 11 days in GSM, 8 to 14 days in WCDMA, and 4 to 5 days in GSM or WCDMA with WLAN being active. Yet, in cruel reality, Nokia E65 lasts in GSM networks for no longer than 4 ? 5 days. On the left, under the battery is a tiny slot for a microSD memory card. A SIM card can only be placed in the phone if the battery has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     The phone dismounted ? retail package?s full content  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is accompanied by an extensive number of accessories, standard for high-class models. Besides a charger, a battery, a software CD, and a manual Nokia E65 also comes along with a Nokia CA-53 USB data cable, a Nokia HS-5 mono headset as well as a very attractive cover Carrying Pouch CP-18 for protection against fingerprints. There are only two elements missing so that perfection is achieved: a stereo headset and a memory card with adapter.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Four new elements <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Few novelties are visible immediately. What you will definitely not overlook in Nokia E65, however, is its four new functional keys located beneath the display. Each of them has a specific function. The icon of the first key is more or less clear: a simple compilation of pre-selected conference call; the phone allows you to choose the participants directly from the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       A closer look at the four new functional keys  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second functional key carries the logo of a ring star. It is an equivalent to the multimedia key present in all models from the N series collection, that is, it carries out any preset task. The image in the top right key is more than evident: shortcut access to the phonebook. The last key silences or activates the microphone during ongoing calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The function of each of the rest of the keys edging the four functional keys is rather obvious: context keys, a call-control key, a menu-access key, and a deleting ?C? key. All of them, however, require some practice as their marginal areas are inactive and thus you have to first get used to the slim profile of the phone and then make sure you press keys? centers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Numeric keypad ? keys are low merging virtually into the surrounding surface  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now have a look at the internal, main keypad of Nokia E65. As pattern from the above images, each side of this keypad is narrower by approximately 5 mm due to the rails of the sliding mechanism. Missing millimeters are most perceptible on the keys; the latter are narrow, equally sized, with low uplift and virtually inaudible press response. There is sag in the middle of each key. To sum up, typing on Nokia E65?s internal keypad is an easy task, it is really comfortable. On the other side, it may not turn to be an easy job for SMS fans with large fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is controlled through a light sensor in the top right corner above the main display. On bright sunny days it does not even get activated. At night it is decently white and evenly distributed under the entire keypad, except under its very right margins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Big, yet so fine <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The light sensor controlling the keypad backlighting also serves the display illumination. The latter is fully active on sunny days while at night it is easier to read even at lower light conditions. If default settings do not meet your expectations, feel free to modify them according to your will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Display ? display backlighting ? full-scale backlighting ? keypad detail in the dark  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself is by a millimeter narrower and by 4 millimeters longer than the display of the forerunner Nokia E60. Even so its grid is very fine with particular irregularities being visible to very demanding users only. The pity here is that resolution has been cut back to the standard 240 x 320 pixels. The color depth has remained unchanged - the display is capable of visualizing up to 16M colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do you remember our critical remarks on the miniature font of the date and time details on the screen-saver of the main display in former Nokia phones? Well, it seems that those times are gone for good. In Nokia E65 both date and time in the strip screen-saver are larger and thus visible from distance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> No changes in Symbian <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The OS is the same, yet a bit different. Nokia E65 uses the last edition of the operational system Symbian OS 9.1 with S60 3rd Edition user interface. Nonetheless, you will probably be dissatisfied. Already 2 new Feature Packs have been introduced for the S60 3rd Edition platform - they supply it with new functions and some other updates. Considering that Nokia E65 was one of the hottest newcomers at the 3GSM congress in Barcelona last month, at least Feature Pack 1 would have been highly appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to older Symbian versions in terms of software design this last edition is safer and far more efficient, which has a lot to do with the fact that each single program used in the phone, even the cheapest one, requires a special certificate. In this new system you can update firmware without visiting the respective authorized service dealer. This last Symbian also provides USB support, but the memory of the phone is not accessible in USB mode. For this reason you need to get yourself an additional memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Always on the move <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many Symbian users will have difficulties imaging a main display without references to favorite programs or overview of tasks, or main events from the calendar. References to functions and programs can be modified from the settings, just like functions assigned to the two context keys beneath the display. Beneath the icons there is a dynamic task list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides missed calls, received messages, oncoming events in the calendar, the number of pending tasks, and running music files, Nokia E65 can also alert you of newly received email messages or SIM card available services. The active mode could even include a list of the last items of a given type. There is also a useful Wi-Fi indication bar; if clicked on, the system starts to automatically check interface for available Wi-Fi networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Settings ? active stand-by mode ? searching for WLAN   &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by mode preferences are configurable from the Settings menu. Along with the above mentioned folder in the active mode here you can also set which modules should or should not appear on the main display so that space is best made use of. For the moment it seems that it is only possible to work with modules delivered together with the OS. Nonetheless, we expect that user-configuration of the stand-by display through third party applications will be available in near future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu is visualized in two standard ways: 3 x 4 icons or as a 6-item list. Menus are cyclic, that is, they do not finish at the display end, but roll back to the next item in line or column. You could also move by using shortcut keys, where key location on the keypad corresponds to icon location in the matrix or in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The menu in a matrix format ? as a list ? user-configurable application  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Preset tools are ordered in thematic folders, while newly installed programs are organized in a folder called ?Installations?. Each item can be picked up and moved somewhere else, into a different folder or be renamed. If an item is not part of the system, it could even be deleted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> It works everywhere <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>According to the legends on the retail package Nokia E65 distributed on the market is quad-band, that is, it can be used in all GSM networks supporting 850/900/1800/1900 MHz bands. You should also be able to communicate in the 3G networks WCDMA 2100 or via VoIP (Internet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call quality is standard, even though in particular moments it would not have been bad if volume levels both of earphones and speaker had been higher. On the other hand, there were also moments when the opposite part was excessively loud. Apparently, the reason for such a difference stays with the opposite side, not with Nokia E65 itself. The phone, however, features another rather unusual problem: constant peeping in the earphone, which remains present no matter whether you call or not, whether the display is activated or not, etc. It is not a big deal, but yet it deteriorates the entire impression of the phone. It might quite well be a defect in a tester model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do not want or cannot hold in hand the Nokia E65 when calling, employ the single-earphone handsfree from the retail package. Music from a single earphone? Forget about it: first you will be considered technologic barbarians; and second: the sound quality reproduced by the earphone serves for nothing more but calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess our reference to 3G networks evoke notion of video calls in many of you. Since Nokia E65 lacks a front cover camera for transmitting caller images, however, the only applicable option here is one-way video calls, that is, Nokia E65 can receive the video of the other party, but can not send video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Call settings ? automatic SMS ? image in a video call ? VoIP can get automatically deactivated  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is possible to silence the ringtone of incoming calls, reject calls by sending the caller a preset excusing SMS, or accept them and start to record the conversation. Unfortunately, Nokia has not learned its lesson? the duration of the voice recorder has not been extended and continues to be a mere 1 minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Received, missed, and dialed calls are stored in independent folders inside the Call register. Information about calls? date and time is available too. In case that you have made more than one call to the same number or received more than one call from identical number, these only appear once with the date and the time of the last try. From the Call register settings you could also select storing period for all registered events or make ongoing call duration become visible on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Call register ? last calls ? call duration ? data register  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Straight from the Call register you can make a call, send a SMS or a MMS, or save a number into the phonebook. The register also indexes call duration and transferred data. In the latter case, however, it is not enough to simply press the green key from the stand-by; applications are run from the main menu. This way you are provided access to a detailed overview of what exactly has been done with the phone: single (and repeated) calls and data connections. The Call register can be organized by connection type or even by a specific phone number.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Millions of contacts <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses shared memory, which means it can fit in an unlimited number of contacts and perhaps even an infinite amount of phone numbers for each contact. Along with first and last name each entry can also contain: company, position, nickname, foot-note, mobile numbers, land numbers, video call numbers, Internet numbers, fax numbers, pagers, Push-to-talk addresses, emails, web sites, notes, street addresses, and birth date. Each entry can be assigned an infinite amount of numbers, 50 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Editing a contact ? phonebook menu ? details ? label modification  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is accessed from the menu through a shortcut from the stand-by display, or via the new key mentioned earlier, located top right from the main four-way control key. Searching is performed by gradually typing the first letters of the respective name. Entered letters are compared to the initials of both first and last names no matter which one of them is set as primary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Voice dialing speaker: settings  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>All names in the phonebook can be voice-dialed. It is not necessary that you record a name tag of your own as Nokia E65 recognizes any voice. The phone presents two preset speakers: Martin and Ellen. When you press the respective key and pronounce the name of the person you are to call, the phone first visualizes them, then reads out their name with an automatic voice, and finally dials the number assigned as default. Shortcut keys to particular numbers in the phonebook are user-configurable too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Emerging voices <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking about voice options, let us also mention how voice commands can be used to run functions. Again, you will find pre-installed voice tags for the most frequently used programs. These tags can be modified, but it will always be the selected speaker that will pronounce them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Basic selected functions ? command menu ? settings ? selection of other applications  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are too lazy to make the effort and read your SMS yourself, then make use of the installed speaker. If the message is not in English though, we do not recommend using this option; few of what the phone speaker would manage to pronounce in a language different from English will sound familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Voice help: menu ? codebook ? context menu ? watch  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the menu there is a special application called ?Voice help? for users with sight problems. It is some kind of a menu inside a menu. ?Voice help? picks up the most important phone functions and organizes them in a list. When the cursor is placed on a particular item of this list, an automatic voice reads what is being visualized on the display. This way one can browse the call register, the phonebook, dial various numbers, use the voice mailbox, or even get to know what the time is. Unlike Martin and Ellen the ?Voice help? operator pronounces details in languages different from English quite successfully.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Online or offline <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s now go back to the phonebook. Each stored contact can be assigned a specific ringtone and an image. The latter appears in a tiny icon when its owner calls you or you dial his name. Contacts can be organized into groups, each of which can be individualized through a specific ringtone, but cannot be assigned an image. The groups may be used for call filtering within ringing profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       List of profiles ? context menu ? profile details configuration  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Nokia E65 features 5 standard profiles plus an additional one for using the phone in an offline mode. More profiles can be user-configured. Within profiles options you can independently set up specific ringtones for calls, video calls, messages, and emails. Volume, vibrations, keypad sounds, and the above mentioned filters can be set up from here too. If you use the filters, Nokia E65 will only ring if calls from pre-selected numbers are coming in. In the rest of the cases it will merely blink. The profiles offer another interesting option: you can select, whether or not the phone should read with an automatic voice the name of the calling person. The only requirement here is that the caller is in the phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nearly all existing formats a mobile phone is able to support can be used as ringtones in Nokia E65. Obviously, MID files with 48-voice polyphony are the basic ones. Besides, Nokia E65 supports AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, M4A, AMR (NB-AMR), Mobile XMF, RealAudio 7,8,10, SP-MIDI file, and True tones (WB-AMR). The vibration?s small motor is quite decent, just like one would expect form a really elegant gentleman. It can be felt inside a pocket, but is not too rough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> SMS <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS application has undergone no modifications. The font is easy to read, the space for typing texts is the same. During the typing process Nokia E65 automatically corrects letter spacing in order to make the text look better, which is quite unusual, but yet very interesting. This extra can be considered either a dish for aesthetes, or an unnecessary load for the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Message options ? editor ? modifying options ? word alternatives  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sent messages are archived in a ?Sent? folder, whose content is user-configurable, that is, it can be limited from the settings. The amount of sent and received SMS is limited by free memory space. MMS are easy to create; their profile is automatically set by the application ?Setup manual?. The editor is simple and well organized. You can write a text, and then insert an image, an audio, or a video file. An instant messaging client is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Setup manager ? email configuration ? detailed settings ? a folder with messages  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create an email account using the Settings manual, just like in the case of MMS. Configuration is no more automatic. You have to enter at least the basic parameters of your mailbox. Once these have been memorized, you can continue with setting further properties or start to download from the corresponding server. Emails in HTML format open up seamlessly. The editor works with accounts through POP3 and IMAP4. You can download either entire messages, or just headers with a subsequent selection of desired/non-desired items. Nokia E65?s client manages Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel (Microsoft Office 2000/XP/2003) attachments as well as all files compatible with the applications Zip Manager and Adobe PDF.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Why so simple? <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Attachments are downloaded and viewed without difficulties. If you try to edit them though, you will run into troubles. It makes little sense, but Nokia has once again equipped an office phone with a document viewer without any editing options. Someone might protest considering the smaller size of Nokia E65?s keypad, which seems rather uncomfortable for editing. Yet, we think that typing a few explanatory notes is not an impossible mission for a 12-element keypad. Work with archives is another story. While earlier Zip Manager would only read zipped files, the one installed in Nokia E65 is already able to zip files on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Office ? Adobe PDF ? menu and... ? ...Zip manager settings  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the corporative type of customer base Nokia E65 is meant for, it is equipped to download further management applications, if necessary. You can download compatible programs straight from Nokia official website or using the Download! application already available in the phone. The Download! application includes a regularly updated catalogue with services and products (often free of charge) compatible with your particular phone model. For work with corporate emails, in particular, Nokia offers applications like BlackBerry Connect and Mail for Exchange. In the Office Tools folder you will find a tool called ?Mobile Search?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Download!: main menu ? email tools ? synthesizers ? application Reuters  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In one of the available folders we even found alternative versions of voice synthesizer. Thirty speakers from all over the world are available. Before you download the item you have selected, a brief info box with price, size, and a short description pops out. If you want to be updated daily, sign in to receive daily news from Reuters for free. If you are a frequent traveler, you may find the application WorldMate with instant weather forecast, unit converter, and other useful functions pretty helpful. The latter is also free of charge. For those lacking entertainment the game Golf Pro Contest is available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Internet in all modes <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu, under Web you will find a high-class Nokia Internet browser. The main cursor is controlled from the four-way navigation key. Everything here works like in communicators, with the mere difference that there is no touchpad. Use the cursor to click on links. If you place the cursor closer to the margins of the page, the latter starts to scroll in the corresponding directions. If you continue to scroll, the phone will show you where exactly on the page you are at that very moment with a visualization of a mini-map. The mini-map can be opened from the menu too. Previews are also applied in history browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;     Browsing ? a whole page on the display ? text version of MM ? visual work with history  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise excellent, the Internet browser suffers one significant drawback: it cannot be used in landscape, although the application itself implies such an option (compare to Nokia E60?s Internet browser).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization as well as file copying from or into the phone is provided through Bluetooth or IrDA connection. If your computer lacks wireless adapters, employ the system cable delivered together with the phone. Faster transfers of bigger-size files will require the use of USB mode (only memory card will be accessible). The E65 cannot be charged through a computer port, unfortunately. As soon as you plug in the data cable, Nokia E65 will offer you two possibilities: work in PC Suite mode for synchronization and control through computer, or Data transferring for USB Mass Storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PC Suite is a standard implemented default application for communication between phone?s software and a computer. It is usually available on an enclosed CD, but you can also find its latest versions on the Nokia website.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Breathtaking speed <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 establishes Internet connection through the technologies GPRS and EDGE, both in Class 10. Of course, you might be able to turn profit from far faster connection, if you are located in a place covered by 3G signal. The flashing-point of all data transfers however, is Nokia E65?s integrated support of wireless WLAN networks, more commonly known as Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Nokia official website Nokia E65 supports IEEE 802.11b/g, which virtually means that it is able to transfer information at the stunning speed of 54 Mbit/s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 features WLAN manual application for work with wireless networks. It helps you detect all available wireless networks in the surrounding area and connect to them if possible (the latter depends on whether the respective network is secured or not).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Wi-Fi networks configuration ? Internet access options  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with WLAN you will also find the so called VoIP application. This is a program enabling calls through the use of Internet. Wi-Fi appears to be the ideal support for VoIP, even though other data technologies could also be applied. VoiP Internet calls are located in the phone settings. It is one of the default options for connection between incoming and outgoing calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call testing through Internet is the same with testing any other function depending on network signal quality, that is, pretty tricky. Flying experience with video calls executed through home-established wireless networks shows that they could resemble 3G network connections pretty successfully. Anyway, as we mentioned earlier, signal quality is a decisive factor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle> Camera <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And here we strike again into an old problem: cameras built in mobiles which are ?made for business?. One of the greatest assets of the previous model Nokia E50 was that users were offered two purchase options: with or without integrated camera. The camera is especially a sensitive feature in work environments where information protection is enforced by all means necessary ? meaning that employees are not allowed to have cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Camera application ? context menu ? picture setup  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has equipped the E65 model with a 2 megapixel camera. This means you can take pictures in a resolution up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. In spite of this, it becomes clear, once the camera has been run, that it is nothing more but a complementary application. Its user interface dates back to the times before the N-series models were released, when Nokia cameras were thought to be of average quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display, whose surface remains partially unused when pictures are taken, shows information on the number of images still possible to make as well as on the 4x digital zoom. If any of the additional functions is active, its icon appears in the view-finder. The functions referred are: night mode, sequence, self-release, white balance, or even color effects. Pictures are stored in JPEG format and carry detailed EXIF information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video is concerned, there are a few innovations worth mentioning. Nokia has increased the resolution used in older Symbian models, jumping from 176 x 144 pixels to 352 x 288 pixels. What?s more, it has started to substitute the older 3GP format for the more universal MPEG-4. Whatsoever, Nokia E65 visualization capabilities remain far behind the VGA resolution achievements in Nokia 6233, for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle> Music player <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has remained untouched, which does not mean anything bad at all, by the way. In several Nokia models already it has been given the highest possible mark. Music tracks can be shown all together, ordered by artist, genres, albums, or composers. Volume levels are sufficient, with the highest ones being almost unusable. What could make the sound better, though, is the acquisition of better audio accessories. For the very moment the only officially supported accessory is the mini-speakers Nokia Mini Speakers MD4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player keeps running when minimized too. In such case the name of the played file appears on the main display, from where it is also possible to adjust volume. When a call is coming, the player mutes gradually; once the call has been ended, the payback is resumed. Incoming calls ringtones can be heard in the earphone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Video records can be played either in standard size, or in a full-screen mode. The latter is pretty handy at boring moments due to the horizontal positioning of the display.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia E65 offers 50 MB of internal memory. Our advice for multimedia fans is to extend existing memory by purchasing an additional memory card.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle> Time management <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What to accentuate more in a manager?s phone if not its organizing functions. The most common, of course, is the Calendar. Here you can open a month, week, or day view as well as choose among three types of events. If you place your selection on a day marked with an event in the month or the week view, a bubble containing details on that particular event pops out. If you start to type while you are viewing the calendar, a new Meeting item is automatically created and the description being entered is visualized inside it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Month view at the calendar ? context menu ? editing ? day view  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks are located separately or as a part of the calendar. They are shown in both locations according to the date they are due. Tasks not accomplished on their due date are automatically snoozed till the moment they are marked-off as accomplished. Export from the calendar and the task list is a basic function of the active stand-by mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to nominate the worst Symbian function in smartphones, then this will doubtlessly be the alarm clock. It has survived years without a single improvement: no repetition, no option for setup of more than one alarm time, nothing at all. It will wake you up, but that?s all. Let?s hope that better times are to come with the release Feature Pack 1, in whose standard features the alarm clock may finally live to experience so-longed functions. Here are several other standard organizing functions present in Nokia E65: notes, calculator, unit converter, and an elementary file manager.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A piece of news in this Symbian version is the application Teams. It is basically a state-of?the-art analogue of the call groups. Here the phone does not filter incoming calls; it is you who should provide the filtering. The application is based on a simple principle: you need to create a team, in which you subsequently insert any number of contacts. Should you need to later contact all members of such a team, you just mark it in the list and chose the means of communication: call, SMS, web address, Push-to-talk, or conference call.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle> A bit of everything <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E65 features one especially exquisite application ? ?Search?. We did miss this one in mobile phones. Here is how it works: with the time items in you phone start to pile and you start to slowly lose your grip. Thanks to ?Search? you do not have to delete some of them in order to organize your agenda. ?Search? helps you browse all your messages, emails, events in your calendar, your contacts, other files, tasks and notes, or even a random combination of the above mentioned items. Even though phone?s content is not indexed anywhere, searching takes no more than a few seconds before you are offered a satisfying result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Browsing ? the application Location ? Navigator  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Flash Lite is also present for work with flash animations and applications. What?s more, Nokia E65 features software support for external GPS modules connectable through Bluetooth. There are three pre-installed products for GPS ? Space with up-to-date information from the closest environment, Navigator, and Description points for localization of device position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another innovation is the option to export the display to an external device. It might sound insignificant for common users, but for businessmen this option is a true savior during corporative meetings and conferences. All files can be sent from the phone to a compatible printer via Wi-Fi.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle> Difficult dilemma <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Were you looking forward to purchasing the new Nokia E65 as soon as it appeared in the Internet stores? Poor you ? The phone doesn?t differ much from its forerunners, and especially from Nokia E60. It is not even worth mentioning that newly implemented applications can easily be insalled in older Nokia models thanks to Nokia?s liberal approach. All in all, our expectations of more innovations have not been met. What might make Nokia E65 a successfully selling phone is its solid construction, elegant design and the slider form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case one thing is for sure: by choosing Nokia E65 you get a high-class elegant office helper together with all pros and cons of a Nokia ? Symbian cooperation.</paragraph>
