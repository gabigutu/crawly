			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Galaxy Ace S5830 did well for Samsung in the midrange. And, as we all know by this point, midrange droids are a force to be reckoned with, especially among users looking to move up from dumbphones without breaking the bank. Now, exactly a year later, the S7500 Ace Plus enters the fray looking to build on the success of the original.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7500 Galaxy Ace Plus official photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It seems that Samsung has taken note of the major drawbacks found in its initial Ace offering, and provided improvements in many key areas, most notably a more robust processor and larger internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while it is an improvement per se, VGA video recording @ 30 fps is nothing to write home about, considering the original Ace had that fixed via a software update. Now that Samsung upped the processor to 1Ghz. That being said, the Ace Plus offers a spec sheet that we would write home about, if, you know, we didn't have cell phones and such.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there were no blatantly poor areas in which the original Galaxy Ace needed to be improved upon (besides the camera, of course), the updated processor, internal storage, RAM and slightly larger screen make the Ace Plus feel-and perform-like an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android has seen many improvements since the Froyo 2.2 version originally found on the first Ace, and while it's no Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread 2.3.6 runs absolutely glitch-free on the Ace Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming up is our traditional hardware tour, where we look at the Galaxy Ace S7500 in detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The unremarkable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the box you'll find the manual alongside a microUSB cable and A/C adapter. Unlike the original Galaxy Ace S5830, there's no complimentary 2 GB microSD card in the bundle, but then again it's not as badly needed. The Ace Plus has 3GB of internal storage, which is enough to get you going. The original had the dismal 158 MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus measures 114.5 x 62.5 x 11.2 mm and the all-plastic handset weighs 115 grams, which are virtually the same dimensions as the original Ace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The edges are curved, which makes the phone appear slimmer, and the build-quality is good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the device features the slightly larger screen, 3.65 inches compared to 3.5 to be exact, which forces the minutely larger overall dimensions. Not that the extra millimeter here and there makes any noticeable difference. The increased screen real estate mostly comes at the expense of the bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the bigger screen features the same HVGA (320x480) resolution, which makes for a slightly lower ppi ratio than the Ace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 has an average LCD screen. The brightness and contrast are okay, but the colors are quite dull. Viewing angles are far from perfect and sunlight legibility leaves a lot to be desired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results of our display test on the Ace Plus alongside several other devices for reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as touchscreen sensitivity goes we have no complaints - the screen is responsive enough but not overly so (a feature that can be annoying since it often results in unwanted taps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there is the proximity sensor, which blends well with the surrounding surface. There's no ambient light sensor though, so the display brightness cannot be adjusted automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there's an arrangement of three keys, typical for Samsung. The hardware home key is central, with two capacitive buttons on either side - Menu and Back. The latter two are only visible when backlit - with the backlighting off, they disappear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 there's the lanyard eyelet and the volume rocker. The volume rocker is quite thin, but prominent just enough to use comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is on the right (as it is on many Samsung phones), which makes it accessible with both the thumb of the right hand or the index finger of the left, depending on which hand you're holding it with. This positioning can be uncomfortable for some though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Ace S5830, the microSD slot is no longer side-mounted, but is instead under the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of the phone is the 3.5mm standard audio jack, as well as the small crevice for removing the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone features the USB port and the mic pinhole. The microUSB port is used for both data and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus has changed since the early version we used in our pre-release preview and we like the new look and feel better. The new back panel takes after the original Galaxy S with a subtle chin. The textured pattern, which is pleasant to touch, we last saw in the Galaxy S Advance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the original panel from our preview, it is also practically impervious to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera lens is centrally placed near the top of the back panel, along with the LED flash. Just like in the original Ace, the lens is exposed and vulnerable to scratches so you'll have to take care not to damage it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back also features the loudspeaker grille, which has a small nub that keeps the speaker from getting muffled when you place the phone down on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover is the SIM card slot and the battery. This is also where you can access the microSD slot. Located on the right edge of the phone, it's perfectly hot-swappable. On 2G networks, the 1300 mAh battery is quoted at 670 hours of standby (420 h in 3G) and up to 11 hours of talk time (7 h 20 min in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the hardware package keeps its target audience in mind; a consumer who may be upgrading from a feature phone or an entry-level smartphone, who wouldn't pay a fortune, but doesn't want to scrape the bottom of the barrel either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taken by itself, the addition of a slightly bigger screen is a moot point. On one hand, 3.6 inches at HVGA is hardly the best there is. The pixel density is below average, which makes the UI look somewhat grainy at times. On the other hand, the low resolution puts no strain on the processor and helps to increase performance. And as we said at the beginning, the 1 GHz processor runs the software without skipping a beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is our tour of the Android-powered TouchWiz-skinned Galaxy Ace Plus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android topped with TouchWiz 4.0 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus runs Gingerbread 2.3.6 with the most recent TouchWiz 4.0 launcher. The visually rich experience and added functionality should be no news for loyal Samsung users. Of course, the company's high-end phones are moving on to Ice Cream Sandwich but the Ace Plus has nothing to be ashamed of in terms of speed and reponse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at our video of the device in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The redesigned lockscreen of the Ace Plus has the usual integration of missed events with shortcuts to the relevant apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreens. A pinch on any homescreen zooms out to an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a taskbar at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can choose List view instead of the default Grid view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. You can swap the first three with different ones (by default the shortcuts are Phone, Contacts, Messaging). The rightmost is the app drawer/home shortcut used to toggle between the apps menu and the homescreen, so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus you get a standard Android task switcher but with one modification - it has a button to launch a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager which Samsung have preinstalled offers a lot of functionality. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you would only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus runs on a single-core 1 GHz Snapdragon S1 processor with the older Adreno 200 GPU and has 512 MB worth of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressed with the speedy response of the phone, we ran a couple of benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of them reflect the low-to-mid-range position of the Galaxy S Plus, but we'll say it again - the handset was a nice surprise in terms of general speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus is very responsive and runs the OS glitch-free. HD video is too much to ask of course and the poor codec support is another downside of the Qualcomm chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge your contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information, while the other stores call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only Facebook and LinkedIn contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus had almost no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting or holding the call, or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, while sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also performed our traditional loudspeaker test. The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus scored an Average mark. The vibration on the other hand is strong, which will alert you in case you don't hear the ringer in a loud environment. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Complete messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging interface is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly locate a message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts for easier sorting and viewing. Conversation layout is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also onboard here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as XT9. Both are fairly comfortable, although the keys might feel a little cramped in portrait. The landscape keyboard should be good enough. There's handwriting recognition but no Swype.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Slick gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. It supports sharing images over Bluetooth, email, messaging along with uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also offers some editing options - cropping, 90-degree rotation and some more advanced features such as image adjustments, effects and selections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs or FF/rewind by sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple yet powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy Ace can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution. Never mind the higher clock speed, Qualcomm processors aren't famous for wide video codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn't play, but that's overkill on a HVGA display anyway. But you're not limited to the Galaxy Ace display. Thanks to DLNA you can view photos and videos on compatible hardware - like TVs or computers with the right software (the latest version of Windows Media player for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be - there almost isn't one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7500 Galaxy Ace Plus pulled off a decent, if unspectacular performance in our audio quality test. The smartphone did well with an active external amplifier and decent when a pair of headphones is plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Ace Plus show its full potential and achieve some excellent scores. It's not particularly loud and its frequency response could be better, but the other readings are as good as they should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of a huge hike in stereo crosstalk, and some extra intermodulation distortion. The rest of the scores remained pretty decent so it seems the Galaxy Ace Plus is ready to offer more than what the average user needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus comes with a 5MP camera and an LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. The lack of an actual shutter key tells us photography isn't taken too seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get the front/back camera switch and the flash control. You can replace those two and add two more (for a total of four) shortcuts to any option in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus comes to replace a phone that was very good at taking stills and we hoped the successor to deliver too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well the final results reflect that the Galaxy Ace Plus is a good cameraphone. Images had impressively low noise levels, colors come out great and there's plenty of detail to go around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shadows still hide enough detail and automatic exposure got the right ISO each and every time we were shooting, even in these conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shooting macro is something the Ace Plus likes to do. Images turned out great with good detail at really close up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus can be measured against other 5MP cameraphones in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording doesn't impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts. You can use the front camera to record video too, but at a lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the original Ace the Plus version is capped at VGA video recording at 30fps in .MP4 format, with at a bitrate of 10.1Mbps. That's just not enough and we would've loved to see the quality improved to HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are smooth but detail isn't impressive. Colors are okay too and so is the focus in the video. The Galaxy Ace Plus records sound in mono @ 96Kbps bitrate and only a 16.0kHz sampling rate, which isn't satisfactory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're the uploading to YouTube or Facebook type this phone just won't satisfy your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an untouched VGA@30fps sample (3.6MB) straight from the phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Above average connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus has quad-band 3G and GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 for fast local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support and a Wi-Fi hotspot option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as always, flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we've seen before - it combines your email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and email accounts and shows all incoming messages on one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There's filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A plethora of organizing tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a To-Do app called Task and a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace comes with the ThinkFree Office pack pre-installed - it's a document viewer and an editor combined. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the office package is excellent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus has the latest version of the Android Market - now called Google Play. The new name and icon aside there aren't major changes in the look of the app store. In select countries aside from apps you'll also find music, movies and books but this content remains limited so far. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connect to a PC wirelessly with Kies Air<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer's web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone - from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who's connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a package that has a 1 GHz processor, 3 GB of storage, 512 MB of RAM and a 5MP camera, all for around &#x20ac;220, the Ace Plus isn't very hard to recommend. If you can live without some of the extras, such as a larger, higher-resolution screen, front-facing camera or better video recording, you'll find that the Ace Plus doesn't hurt your wallet much either. And we really can't stress enough how fast Android runs on the Ace Plus, as well. There certainly are better midrange Android phones but they're either more expensive or not exactly brand new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The likes of the HTC Salsa, Motorola Defy+ and Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V are all in the Ace Plus' price range. With an 800MHz and 3.4-inch display, the Salsa can't compete with the Ace Plus in terms of processing power or screen size, but it does have a secondary camera, and features a more compact (although slightly thicker) profile. The Defy+ and Xperia neo V both have higher resolution 480 x 854 pixel displays at roughly the same size, but neither can compare to the 3 GB of internal memory found in the Ace Plus (both come with 2GB microSD cards, however). The Xperia neo V also comes with 720p video recording, a secondary camera, and an ICS update in the works. At 13 and 13.4 mm thickness, respectively, both are going to add a bit to the waistline of the 11.2 mm Ace Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Salsa &#x2022; Motorola DEFY+ &#x2022; Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't have your heart set on Android, Nokia provides some very sensible options in the &#x20ac;200 price range. The Nokia 701 and Nokia Lumia 710 both have higher resolution displays and 8 GB of storage, not to mention 720p video recording. The 701 runs Nokia's Symbian Belle after the latest OS update and has a slightly smaller (but higher resolution) screen than the Ace Plus. It boasts a robust 8MP camera (fixed focus), a secondary VGA camera and better 3G speeds. The Windows Phone-powered Lumia 710 has a very nice ClearBlack LCD (480 x 800 pixels on a 3.7" diagonal) and is powered by a faster 1.4 GHz processor, but has no way to extend its 8 GB of internal memory.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The S7500 Galaxy Ace Plus does well to remedy the shortcomings of the original Ace. The quick processor and added RAM leave nothing to be desired in terms of speed. And it's obviously targeting users for whom a high resolution screen is not as important as long battery life. As usual, it's Samsung themselves that's making it hard to choose. It's arguable whether the Galaxy Ace of all phones was in need of two updates - the Ace Plus and the Ace 2. They must've thought that double coverage wouldn't hurt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Plus is a great phone if you want to be introduced to the smartphone game, without being thrown in the deep end. But the Nokia Lumia 710 can put more pressure on them than Samsung are used to in the midrange.</paragraph>
