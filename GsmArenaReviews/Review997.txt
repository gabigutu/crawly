		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took some time but Sony had the big comeback many have been waiting for. The Xperia Z is selling well and we suspect it's been the driver for turning the company's fortunes around in the first quarter of the year. It's now time to carry that momentum over to the midrange and the Xperia SP looks like the right phone for the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nicely spec'd screen and an adequately powered chipset come together in a beautiful and well-built package, giving the Sony Xperia SP the right tools to survive in the cutthroat battle in this price bracket. The transparent LED strip, which now has even richer functionality, will definitely add character too to help it fight the last generation of flagships, fresh from relegation to the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP is a well-rounded package that's making very few compromises, considering its standing in the pecking order. A 1080p screen is certainly a nice thing to have, but we can live with 720p at this size and, while the two extra CPU cores that today's flagships offer give a definite productivity boost, the 1.7GHz Krait should do just fine in day-to-day tasks. Not to mention that the Xperia SP GPU is of the class-leading Adreno 320 variety, so gaming performance should be as good as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems then that Sony is ready to produce yet another gem in the midrange that offers a loud bang for your buck. The company has made this their specialty and we are certainly liking Sony's chances here. Besides, the Japanese are clearly fast learners - addressing the major issues of the Xperia P with its successor. The Xperia SP has the right-sounding battery backup (more than an Xperia Z, actually) and none of the WhiteMagic display trickery that compromised indoor performance to boost outdoor visibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hopefully, there'll be no nasty surprises as we go and we'll be feeling just as positive about the Sony Xperia SP by the time this review is complete. Join us for the ride and find out - unboxing coming up right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is about what you'd expect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP comes in the same slim box as the Xperia Z/ZL pair of flagships. Inside you will find an A/C adapter, a USB cable and a pair of headphones. The USB cable is to be used with the dedicated charger as it has no cable of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card supplied either, but given that even high-end smartphones omit that, it would be unfair to expect the Xperia SP to have one. However, the relatively limited internal storage (only 5.8GB are user-available) you'd probably need to get one sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia SP 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 130.6 x 67.1 x 10 mm, the Sony Xperia SP isn't really in the running for the most compact of 4.6" smartphones. It only has a marginally smaller footprint than an LG Optimus 4X HD (which has a 4.7" screen and hardware keys), and it's also 1.1mm thicker than the former LG flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP is also quite heavy at 155g and, while we certainly appreciate the solid feel (the metal frame does add to the total weight), we have to admit that it's not the most comfortable smartphone to carry around. It's just not a device you slip in your pocket and forget about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quick to make up for the less than perfect portability, the Sony Xperia SP scores big in the looks department, featuring a pleasant matte plastic on the back and a co-molded aluminum frame running all around the body. The relatively thick profile does take away some of the high-end feel, but the overall design is still quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic on the back not only looks cool, but also feels sturdy and grippy enough, while the front is mostly a replica of what you get with the high-flying Sony Xperia Z. However, the most characteristic design element of the Sony Xperia SP is certainly the transparent strip at its base.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beginning with their NXT line of devices last year, Sony introduced a new take on the notification LED in the form of an illuminated strip dubbed Ambience light. While it's not something particularly groundbreaking, it does help the Sony lineup stand out in the smartphone crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ambience light illuminates to match your currently selected theme, or the dominant color of the image you are currently looking at in the gallery. It also works in the Walkman music player, lighting up along with the beat of the currently playing track. Of course, you have the option to disable it, if you find it too flashy for you taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP brings a cool upgrade to the transparent strip, allowing it to act as a visual caller ID, by flashing in a specific color, depending on who is calling you. Since it's also visible from the back you will easily be able to tell who is on the other end of an incoming call even when the Xperia SP is lying face down on a table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may add a few millimeters to the footprint (and perhaps to the thickness), but we'd definitely say the Ambience light strip is worth it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>4.6" 720 TFT with the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP comes with a 4.6" TFT screen of 720p resolution, which is the new norm for the mid-range. The pixel density adds up to 319ppi, which is enough to get into Retina territory and make everything appear tack sharp. It's no 1080p beast, but at this size the difference is pretty hard to spot with a naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TFT screen is backed by the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2, which enhances contrast and sharpness, brings down noise and saturates colors to make them more pleasing to the eye. The reds in particular tend to really pop out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast is only average and colors are hardly the best around. Brightness levels are pretty decent, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the subjects of viewing angles. The Sony Xperia SP isn't the best performer in that aspect with color shifting and contrast loss occurring the moment you start tilting the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the sunlight legibility on the Sony Xperia SP is mediocre, meaning that in brighter environments you might need to work a bit harder to find a proper angle for working with the smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP has a pretty standard set of controls as far as the latest smartphones by the Japanese company go. The smartphone relies on virtual buttons, so understandably there are no keys beneath the display. All you can find there is the primary microphone and the transparent antenna which doubles as an illuminated notification strip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VGA front-facing camera is joined by the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the proximity sensor above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the bare microUSB port. The lack of protective cover facilitates usages, but can lead to some dirt accumulation with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, you'll find the volume rocker near the top, the power/lock button (of the signature Xperia variety) and a two-step camera button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We always appreciate a dedicated camera button on a phone, even more so when talking decent snappers. The shutter button on the Sony Xperia SP has good feedback and distinct half-press, although ideally it would have been a bit wider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Sony Xperia SP only features the 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is completely bereft of functional elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Sony Xperia SP is user-removable, but even so you don't get access to the 2370 mAh battery. All you get underneath the plastic cover is the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the microSIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as battery life goes, the Xperia SP posted some very good numbers, even beating out the likes of the Xperia Z and ZL flagships. The Xperia SP achieved a score of 51h in our endurance rating, suggesting that it can last for more than two full days on a charge if you use it for an hour of web browsing, an hour of video watching and an hour of telephony per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on the test can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has done well to make the Xperia SP easy to handle despite its relatively large for the class dimension. The controls are all nicely placed and easy to press, so none of them causes any usability issues.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP runs on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, the same firmware ticking inside the latest Sony flagship, the Xperia Z. Sony has promised to bring the 4.2 Jelly Bean update to its flagship line soon, and there's no reason to believe the Xperia SP won't be getting the same treatment at some point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backend software optimizations, combined with Project Butter, give you as smooth a ride throughout the Xperia SP UI as you can expect thanks to the powerful dual-core chipset and graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia SP in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The Xperia SP gives you the option to change the number of homescreen panes (by adding more or removing any of the default 5) and even select any of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Unfortunately, the widgets in the Xperia SP do not resize or re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.). Depending on the theme you've chosen, the LED strip below the screen will light up in matching color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no overview mode like with previous Sony Xperia smartphones. Instead, you get the homescreen edit menu when you do the familiar pinching gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has been redesigned too. It uses cool new default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). The hardware shutter key actually makes the camera shortcut redundant - it will launch the camera even if the device is locked. When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and now features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is organized in pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome task manager we first met on the Xperia T is also here. It lets you go to the recently opened apps as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are here too. They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage system service is onboard too. It also lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP uses a Snapdragon S4 Pro MSM8960 chipset, which includes a 1.7 GHz dual-core CPU - planting it firmly in the upper end of the midrange. It does, however, feature an Adreno 320 GPU, the same found on the flagship Xperia Z, so we're expecting good performance when it comes to graphic-intensive activities like gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Xperia SP is a midrange device largely due to its dual-core CPU, yet the processor is clocked quite high at 1.7 GHz, which resulted in some pretty good performance in the BenchmarkPi single-core CPU benchmark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to multiple CPU testing, the Xperia SP expectedly lands behind most quad-core devices, but not by much. In fact, the SP results act as a sort of bridge, landing somewhere in the gap between quad-core flagships and dual-core midrangers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the Xperia SP scored more than the Xperia ZL on GeekBench 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Adreno 320 is currently one of the more powerful mobile GPU's around, and the one found in the Xperia SP didn't disappoint, scoring as high as the Xperia Z flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. Here, the Xperia SP was able to top out are charts, but before we get too excited, let's keep in mind that the test is run in native resolution, which in the SP's case is 720p. Most of the other top scores are from 1080p-toting devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having tested many other droids with Google Chrome as the default web browser, we were expected a clearly midrange performance, but it turns out Chrome has become a lot faster after its latest software update. The Xperia SP scored 1116ms on SunSpider, which is the top result by a Sony device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In HTML5 BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo tests, the Xperia SP did very well, once again likely due to the Chrome browser's most recent optimizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're more than happy with the Xperia SP, and particularly impressed by the beefy Adreno 320 GPU found inside. While it cannot match the raw horsepower of some of the top dogs, the 720p display means there aren't as many pixels to push out, resulting in some great performance for its class.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia SP gets activated with a press-and-hold of the virtual Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a review of all popular voice assistants and you can learn even more about Google Now there. Just follow this link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP phonebook has also been upgraded since the last iteration under ICS and, thanks to the light background, it looks livelier. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu. The tabs for Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too. This is where the LED strip comes into play as well. You can set a custom color for a contact, so the ambience light can serve as a caller ID of sorts. Of course you cannot possibly have a different color for every single contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia SP was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia SP automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia SP, and the results were far from impressive. It scored a Below Average mark. We recommend keeping on the xLOUD and turning off the ClearPhase features, otherwise you'll get worse results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia SP offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP comes with the new Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LED strip below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy video player, plays everything but chokes on AC3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP did splendidly with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD, even MKV. The only exception was AC3 audio support - videos with this audio codec did not play at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video editing app called Movie Studio is bundled too. It lets you edit video, images, and audio together (both imported from files as well as recorded/taken by the device itself), using a variety of cool transitions. You can then export the resulting project into a video file that you can share using the SP's generous connectivity features (more on this below).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music when listening on the pre-bundled Sony headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and bookmarks stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is onboard as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test and was about on par with the high-end Xperia Z and ZL. The smartphone got great scores all over, and if it wasn't for its below-average volume levels, it would have been pretty great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but things certainly aren't too bad. The stereo crosstalk rises notably and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels remain pretty low, but the overall performance is still quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 MP camera leaves us wanting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. However, if you use the default Superior auto mode, you only get 7 MP 3104 x 2328 shots instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and regular mode with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all settings accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode among other things. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From what our experience so far shows, though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are a photography enthusiast or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia SP camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geotagging, touch capture and HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does. You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as actual output is concerned, the Xperia SP camera gives you generally oversaturated colors, with average dynamic range and good contrast. The oversaturation is particularly pronounced on the red channel, resulting in occasional clipping and red objects coming out pink. More importantly, though, the Xperia SP sensor resolves an unsatisfactory amount of detail and produces pretty noise images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you switch to the regular auto mode, you get images that appear slightly more natural without that overprocessed look. This gives you more headroom if you plan on post-processing your images, but resolved detail doesn't change significantly, so the output is still far from great.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP challenges the other 8MP shooters in town in our dedicated photo comparison tool. The blown out red channel is very prominent in our color poster, and the quality of the images under artificial lighting is among the worst we've seen from an 8MP shooter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Xperia SP does 1080p HDR videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP is capable of capturing 1080p video footage at 30fps, which is on par with most modern day smartphones. However, as a nice extra touch, the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it one of the few devices to have this feature after the Oppo Find 5 and Sony's own Xperia Z and ZL flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia SP is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images at 1MP resolution. That's less than half the resolution of the individual frames in the video itself and not really worth much. Given that last year's flagships could capture full res stills during video recording, what the Xperia SP offers is inexcusably poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's important, however, is that the Xperia SP does the important things right, at least when it comes to video recording. Videos come up with very good detail and a hover right around the 30fps mark. The bitrate is around 17MBps, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched 1080p video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benefits of the HDR mode are not always as easily visible as we hoped, but it still adds some detail in the highlight areas, which, on some occasions, can mean the difference between a usable and a poor video.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP joins our video quality comparison pool. In contrast to the still camera, the 1080p video recording of the smartphone is quite capable, and even offers good - if a bit grainy - performance under low light. You can take a look at how it compares to other 8MP shooters in the Tools' main page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity package includes LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP has quad-band 2G and up to quad-band 3G connectivity depending on your regional model. Mobile data speeds are an impressive 42 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA. There is also up to six-band (region dependent) LTE support with 100Mbps of download and 50Mbps of upload speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia SP but you can get it off the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP also comes with NFC, although that's easy to overlook considering there are no included NFC tags in the retail package (like with other NFC-enabled Xperia models), and the Xperia SmartTags app to manage them is not available eitehr. In the settings though you can find and use Google Wallet and Android Beam functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you have an Xperia tablet, Xperia link is a simple app that lets you share the internet connection from your phone to your tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range and want to go easy on your data plan, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn form auto-fill and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome does not support Adobe Flash, and neither does Android Jelly Bean in the first place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP offers a completely new social hub, replacing the previously popular Timescape. It's called Socialife.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife is a Sony home-made app that brings together your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Reader accounts. You have a unified Stream page where you can view every social network notification, ordered chronologically or using the Smart Sorting feature. The latter serves the topics you might find interesting ahead of others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Post field which from where you can update your Facebook and Twitter statuses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service offers four widgets - two for your stream with different visual styles, one for quick social status update and one with quick shortcuts to your social friends. The latter also shows new notifications with small balloons in the upper right corner (the iOS style).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP comes with the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view almost any type of document, although you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia SP. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver setting helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold, turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off the mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking for even more organizational options, the Google Play store is full of free apps that can cater to all your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline maps, Google and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another from the Android Market - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot is also part of the Sony Xperia SP package, with a navigation license for 30-days and downloadable maps for offline navigation. You need to pay extra to continue using the app once the trial expires. Unfortunately it was not working on our unit due to some incompatibility with the Android version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is the gate to the app world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Xperia SP has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The midrange Android market has long been a Sony stronghold, and is becoming ever more enticing with offerings like the Xperia SP. We are looking at a more than reasonably powered and competitively priced smartphone with an HD screen, whose robust performance and capable hardware make it the hidden gem in Sony's growing lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the styling is not as sharp as that of the Xperia Z flagship, the Xperia SP's more traditional shape makes it pretty attractive in its own right. And the transparent LED strip at the bottom gives it extra style points - all the while being quite usable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia SP shares another important similarity to Sony's flagship line in the inclusion of the Adreno 320 GPU, which offers an impressive graphics performance thanks to its lower resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the still camera is somewhat of a disappointment but the 1080p videos partially make up for that. The battery is non-user-replaceable but the memory card slot is a welcome improvement over the Sony Xperia P, which is the Xperia SP predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long story short, we believe the Sony Xperia SP to be one of the most compelling packages in the new midrange. It looks good and behaves admirably. It should definitely keep an eye on some of last season's quad-core smartphones, but probably not fear them too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own offering with the LG-made Nexus 4 is perhaps the closest match in both price and features. If you can stomach the rather limited (and non-expandable) internal storage, the Nexus 4 provides a near identical HD screen, twice the RAM, and a superior 8MP camera. Even better, you get quad-core Krait performance alongside all the latest updates directly from Google. Keep in mind that the Nexus 4 is only a deal worth considering if you can get it from the Google Play store in your country - otherwise, it's prohibitively expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG offers another serious competitor in the LG Optimus 4X HD. Launched last June, the phone may not be the freshest offering on the market right now, but LG has done well to give it the 4.1 Jelly Bean treatment. The Geforce GPU on the Tegra 3 chipset won't hold a candle to the Adreno 320 in the Xperia SP, but the quad-core processor and lower pricetag will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 4X HD P880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also offers an alternative to the SP in the form of the Samsung Galaxy Premier. The Premier features a more impressive 720p AMOLED screen, but its dual-core CPU is however inferior to the Xperia SP processor. The Samsung mid-ranger does sweetens the pot with its arguably more feature-full Android Jelly Bean build, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Premier I9260</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is doing the right thing by offering a midrange smartphone hot on the heels of their two flagships. Last year, HTC had a similar thing going on with the One X and the One S but failed to capitalize on the width they had through those two excellent devices. We're yet to see whether or not Sony will do better but if you're looking for a capable smartphone in the 300 euro range, the Xperia SP should be high on your short list.</paragraph>
