			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 is a subtle but meaningful update of what was - literally until a few days ago - the company's top smartphone offering. While designers and engineers were busy fixing the Lumia 920, the guys next door produced a louder bang with the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Lumia 920 was in many ways the flagship that really showed the company with its best foot forward. And the Lumia 925 is a very welcome facelift, sporting a lighter, thinner aluminum frame instead of the all-polycarbonate bulk of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of the same size and resolution, except this time around it's an AMOLED panel, which works great with the mostly black WP8 interface. It's the AMOLED screen too that takes credit for the fat loss. Other small highlights are the inclusion of an FM radio and some minor software improvements, but those will also be seeded to the Lumia 920 with a software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the updated chassis, the Lumia 925 refresh can be likened to BMW's M-Series - they're very similar to their non-M-powered brethren when it comes to design, but the updated body is a definite improvement over the original. In terms of what goes under the hood though, these are two different schools of thought. Because the 925 is basically the same package as the the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 925 is all about the looks and feel - the updated body is a definite improvement, and there's a few extra features thrown in to sweeten the pot as well. Although it may be minor, the inclusion of the thinner and, more importantly, lighter frame takes care of two of the disadvantages we listed for the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is the same as before and while it's not a benchmark blaster, but WP devices have consistently demonstrated they don't need too much horsepower to give a smooth ride through the UI. Of course, heavier apps may tend to load a bit slower, but lags and system freeze should be pretty much out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next, we'll be taking a closer look at the redesigned body in our unboxing and hardware inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Nokia Lumia 925 is a pretty standard deal. Inside the moderately-sized box you'll find a USB cable, an A/C adapter and a headset of a seemingly high quality. We've certainly seen worse in the retail boxes of the Lumia 925's competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items inside the box are a bunch of leaflets and the SIM eject tool, which can be hooked up to a keychain.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 925 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 129 x 70.6 x 8.5 mm the Nokia Lumia 925 is far thinner than the Lumia 920. The 2mm slimmer pofile makes all the difference in the world, making the phone much more comfortable to hold and carry around. We dare say it's exactly what the Lumia 920 should've been in terms of feel and weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has been favoring polycarbonate unibody as the design of choice for its high-end phones, including the latest Lumia 1020. This makes the Lumia 925 the odd one out - it's the first Nokia phone in a while to feature aluminum accents. The latter, combined with the new AMOLED screen, has helped reduce both the phone's thickness and weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, the Nokia Lumia 925, which tips the scales at 139g, is a long way down from the awe-inspiring 185g of the Lumia 920. The updated version is nowhere near as great a burden to carry around. Needless to say you won't be getting sore hands after a long call either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of looks, the Nokia Lumia 925 is closer to the Lumia 720 than the 920. It's a rectangular phone with rounded sides and a tapered back to hide some of the thickness. The sides are made of exposed aluminum, while the back is polycarbonate with a kind of rubberized finish to it. This provides a bit of extra security when holding the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal vs. plastic debate has been heating up in Android land, but the Lumia 925 is somewhere in between. It's not a bad choice as Nokia's polycarbonate has always been top notch and the aluminum still gives a solid, premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum also has another function - it serves as an antenna. The antenna in the grame design became infamous with the iPhone 4, which suffered from the so-called "death grip". That's when touching the metal would compromise reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has promised that the Lumia 925 is immune against it and, indeed, we didn't experience any signal drops. No matter how hard we tried, the phone didn't suffer any signal loss. Kudos to Nokia for pulling that one off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The polycarbonate on the back has a soft touch finish and will come in three different colors at launch - White, Grey and Black. This propensity for monochrome is uncharacteristic of the Lumia line, which favors bright colors like Red, Yellow or Blue. It's durable and not prone to scratches, which is good, because it ultimately means you won't need to wrap the phone in ugly cases to protect it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 925 is wider than most phones with 4.5" or so screens - the bezel is pretty thick and the screen has 15:9 aspect ratio, making it wider to begin with. It's also taller than usual, but at least that leaves enough room around the capacitive keys to prevent accidental touches (which are not uncommon on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and others).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That affects the handling - it's certainly not a deal-breaker (it's on par with the Lumia 920), but narrower phones are more comfortable to hold. Pocketability, however, has soared in part due to the reduced thickness but mostly because of the lower weight. 185g is phablet kind of weight, while 139g is virtually the same as the iPhone 4S which many people carry in their pockets without complaint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that the Nokia Lumia 925 lost some body fat by dropping the wireless charging support of the Lumia 920. You can add that back with a thin back cover that connects to the three pogo pins above the loudspeaker. Nokia has not announced the combined thickness or weight of phone + cover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For its latest iteration of a Windows Phone flagship - the 925, 928 and 1020 - Nokia chose AMOLED over LCD. AMOLEDs have a number of advantages over liquid crystals - deeper blacks and better contrast, lower power usage in some scenarios (especially on WP, where most of the time the background is black) and great viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Nokia Lumia 925 is a 4.5" AMOLED of WXGA resolution (768 x 1280), which is the maximum the OS supports at the moment. The display has 332ppi density and its matrix has a PenTile arrangement. That's not ideal, but at that kind of density you will need to look long and hard to tell the difference. It does become a tad more obvious if you put the Lumia 925 next to a 1080p Android flagship, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gorilla Glass 2 covering the screen is slightly beveled at the edges, which makes it fit better with the aluminum frame around it. This makes swipes from the side of the screen (common in WP) more comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has excellent contrast thanks to the deep blacks. That's typical for AMOLED but what isn't is high brightness. Nokia advertises 600nits, which is slightly higher than we measured, but this is still one of the brightest AMOLED screens around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility turned out very good, with the Lumia 925 landing amongst the top devices in our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another common complaint about AMOLEDs is the colors - too saturated for some people's liking. The Nokia Lumia 925 has an extra setting allowing the user to choose one of eleven saturation levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color temperature option is great too - it has 11 settings and goes from cool through neutral to warm. On LCD phones you're usually stuck with either a cool screen or a warm screen, depending on your preference it's either good or bad, it's a matter of luck hitting the right one. Having control over that takes chance out of the equation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display on the Lumia 925 is laminated to the Gorilla Glass 2 and that reduces screen glare (some of which is caused by the air gap between glass and screen). Nokia's proprietary ClearBlack tech reduces glare even further and the 925 has one of the best screens in terms of sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Nokia Lumia 925 uses the Super sensitive touch technology that debuted on the 920. It can respond to fingernails or car keys, and will detect touches even if you're wearing gloves. You can set the sensitivity to Normal or High and we found even the Normal setting to be capable of working through thin gloves and responding to fingernails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's tweaks to the display don't end there - a feature called Glance displays a clock on the lockscreen while it's off (like on the Symbians of yore). That doesn't waste a lot of energy due to the nature of AMOLED and by default it's set to turn the screen completely off after 15 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Glance feature makes it easy to check the time. There's an option to leave it always on (or turn it off completely) and to dim the clock's brightness in a certain interval (it makes it more comfortable to look at in the dark).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft requirements for a Windows Phone mean there's little variation in terms of controls across the product range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 is no exception. It has three capacitive keys below the display - Back, Home and Search. At the bottom of the glass covering the screen is the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the 1.9MP front-facing camera, the ambient light and proximity sensors, and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the right side of the phone where it gets interesting. Here are the volume rocker, the Power/Lock key and the two-step camera shutter key. They are all made of aluminum and have uniform width, all of them are on the thin side but prominent enough to locate by touch and press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key can be used to wake up the screen, but you can also do that with a double tap a la Nokia N9 (even the new Asha 501 does this). Another way to unlock the Nokia Lumia 925 is to long press the shutter key. There's an option to either start the stock WP camera or Nokia's custom Smart Camera (which we'll cover later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone is quite busy with the microSIM card slot, the microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary mic pinhole. The microSIM card goes in a tray which takes an ejector to open. There's no microSD card slot here and the Lumia 925 doesn't have a third microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and bottom sides of the phone are left completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We leave the aluminum side of the Nokia Lumia 925 to get to the polycarbonate back. There's a bulge around the lens, which was inevitable considering the elaborate imaging setup. The Lumia 925 has a six-element (vs 5 for the Lumia 920) F/2.0 aperture Carl Zeiss lens, the Optical Image Stabilization mechanism and an 8.7MP image sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the camera lens is the dual LED flash that doubles as an AF assist light and video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The positioning of the camera makes it easier to hold the phone when taking a photo - with phones that have their cameras too close to the top edge you always run the risk of your finger getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, further down the back is the loudspeaker grille with a small nub to raise the phone when you place it on the table and keep the loudspeaker from getting muffled. Also around here are the three pogo pins that feed electricity to the phone when you attach the optional wireless charging cover or use certain car docks or other accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden below the polycarbonate back of the Nokia Lumia 925 is the 2,000mAh Li-Ion battery. The back cover isn't user-removable, which means you can't access or replace your battery. It's the same capacity as the battery of the thicker Lumia 920, but we've seen thinner Androids pack bigger batteries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2000 mAh unit inside is said to last for up to 10 hours of talk time or 400h of stand-by in 3G networks, but if its endurance is not enough for you, you'll have to carry either an external juice pack or a battery case - both of which are pretty awkward and uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our test the Lumia 925 posted an endurance rating of 43h, which is an about average score. It can withstand quite a lot of talk time, but its web browsing endurance is only average and its video playback wasn't much better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Nokia Lumia 925 battery test scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about what we test and what exactly these score mean over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another shortfall of the Lumia 925 that it shares with its unibody siblings is the lack of expandable storage. While the more modest Lumia 820 offers you the option to cheaply increase its storage capacity via the microSD card slot, the Lumia 925 is stuck with what it has built-in. Luckily, 32GB, which should be enough for most users. Microsoft and Nokia also provide you with 7GB of free SkyDrive cloud storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 had a great feel in the hand, despite its bulk. Naturally, the Lumia 925 with its more premium aluminum frame feels even better. With the weight loss also taken into consideration, one handed operation doesn't feel like a chore. The smartphone's curved sides and display benefit the handling quite a bit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is Nokia's only smartphone OS and the Finns have taken care to add as much value as possible to the Lumia line. And since Microsoft doesn't really allow UI customizations, adding value translates to supplying exclusive apps and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 comes with the new Amber update preinstalled but that doesn't change the user experience dramatically. It does add a few features like Glance Screen, FM radio support and a new camera lens, but the rest is barely different from the previous WP8 iterations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Glance Screen is one of the coolest features that the Amber update brings along. It's a tribute to the MeeGo lockscreen (and Symbian smartphones of old), where you can always see a clock and get any missed events flagged right on the black standby screen. And just like on the Nokia N9, you can wake up the phone with a double tap. The Glance Screen feature leverages on AMOLED to achieve very good power efficiency - only the handful of pixels needed to display the clock and notifications are actually lit up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several options to the Glance Screen feature. It can either be Timed (after a pre-set period of time it turns off the screen completely to save battery) or always on, if you want to be able to see it at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a fourth option called Peek. It allows you to wave over the phone's face to display the clock and notifications, much like Samsung's Quick Glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lockscreen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone straight into the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications and images. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps to show less ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player replace the lockscreen image with the album art of the currently playing track, or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook can put photos and notifications on the lockscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get an extra resize button, next to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind, the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller or a drag-to-resize option, like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking, though not with the level of user control that Android allows. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). If an app needs to run in the background (sat-nav clients, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps behave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you keep on hitting the back key, you will effectively be closing all of the open apps one after the other, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has confirmed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 can also be controlled by voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice Actions, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 925 comes with the Data Sense app, which shows you the amount of data you've used. Both cellular and Wi-Fi traffic is accounted for. There are different data limit types: one-time, monthly and unlimited. The first two accept custom bandwidth limit values, while the latter is applicable if you have an unlimited data plan, but would still like to track your usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data Sense can also restrict the background data usage for all apps, provided you're near a preset data limit. This will prevent some apps from functioning properly, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 comes with a special feature for kids conveniently dubbed Kids corner (HTC liked it well enough to put a similar feature on the One). You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info relevant to their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 uses the higher-end chipset of the two used by Windows Phone 8 handsets - Qualcomm MSM8960 (1.5GHz CPU, 1GB RAM, Adreno 225). Naturally this means hiccup-free performance and smooth navigation around the UI. Loading times aren't always perfect, but are never too long to be an annoyance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to build the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" options. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many contacts and too many notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions: "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab has the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, but the ringer is quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 offered loud and clear in-call sound. Signal reception was problem-free as well, despite the aluminum frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The Phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 925 scored average. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (only the whole message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails as read/unread, flag and unflag, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with busy inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text does take some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up with the available actions and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2013, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board the Lumia 925, which is one of the few extras it has over the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 audio output is pretty similar to those of the Lumia 928 and the Lumia 920. It's relatively clean and with decent volume levels, which should be enough for most users, but may not be enough to please very demanding audiphiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 925 managed good scores with the higher than average intermodulation distortion the only exception. Volume levels are good, even if not the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones isn't too bad either. It consists of a notable increase in stereo crosstalk and it's certainly not the worst we have seen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid 8MP shooter, backed up by OIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 has an 8.7MP camera that shoots 8MP photos (3264 x 2448) in 4:3 aspect and 7MP photos (3552 x 2000) in 16:9 mode. This is the special sensor design Nokia has used since the N9, which loses only 11% of the resolution when going from 4:3 to 16:9 mode instead of the 25% that traditional sensors do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its primary advantage over the competition is the Optical Image Stabilization. It improves low-light performance by allowing longer exposure (the f/2.0 lens helps here too) and eliminates hand shake in videos. The Lumia 925 brings another upgrade over the 920 - its lens is has 6 elements over the 5 of its predecessor. In theory that should result in sharper images with more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the Nokia Lumia 1020 announcement event, the Finns broke the news that the Lumia 925 will be getting the Nokia Pro Camera app that allows users to adjust the camera settings to their liking. You can read more about it in our Lumia 1020 preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the UI of the built-in camera, it's fairly simple - the controls available on the right edge of the viewfinder are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can swipe to get there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone has rich settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, always on or off. A separate setting allows the LED to work as an AF assist light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the latest camera software Nokia has raised the maximum ISO setting from 800 to 3,200 and has tweaked image processing in low-light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive is available for photo auto-upload (it's turned off by default), but you can install third-party apps to handle this functionality as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses is an interesting feature, allowing third-party camera apps to enhance the core camera functionality without the need to access them separately and get use to their different UIs. The so-called Lenses are like plugins for your camera and they are available directly in the native camera app. They show up in the list of installed apps too in case you'd like to pin a Lens to the start screen, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app. You can set Nokia's exclusive Smart Camera to be launched instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we've mentioned Smart Camera several times already and it's time to explain what it does. It's the next generation of Smart Shoot and is based on technology developed by Scalado (now owned by Nokia).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It shoots a burst of 10 photos at 5MP resolution and allows you to edit those photos later. When editing a Smart Camera photo you choose one of several modes by swiping through their respective cards, each with a helpful label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic feature here is best shot - automatically selecting the best photo out of the 10 (you can manually override the selection). You can also select the best expression for each individual face in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple photos can be used to remove moving objects as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Action shot - a moving object is overlaid on the photo several times to create a sense of motion. You can pick which of the 10 photos are used to create the action shot and the multiple copies can either be opaque or semitransparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few samples captured with the Nokia Smart Cam app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other mode that enhances motion is Motion focus - it locks the moving object, but blurs the background around it. Imagine turning the camera to track a fast moving object, that's the effect that Motion focus simulates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's decision to limit Smart Camera photos to 5MP leaves us scratching our heads. Sure, Smart Camera shoots 16:9 photos, which eats into the resolution, but Nokia's sensor can do 7MP in this mode. We suspect the midrange chipset is the real answer. 5MP is not far ahead of HTC One's 4MP camera and without the benefit of large sensor pixels. It's also no match for the fine detail captured by high-end 13MP shooters either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama is self-explanatory - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying. Shooting in portrait orientation is impossible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting - a tripod works best. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern. You can get back to the image later and correct it if you didn't get it right the first time around (we did that to reduce camera shake visible in the background).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image Quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a pleasing amount of detail in the Lumia 925 shots and considerably more than the Lumia 920 delivered . Apparently, Nokia has tamed the noise reduction and boosted sharpening up a notch. If you look closely, you'll notice some oversharpening halos as a result of that treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That would explain the higher levels of noise as well, but most of it is of the less-irritating luminance variety. In comparison, the Lumia 920 was way too heavy handed with the noise, producing more noise-free shots but also losing a lot of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white balance and color saturation are also better tuned on the Lumia 925 than it was on the Lumia 920 - colors are natural and accurate. Those looking for more punchy output might find them a bit on the dull side, but you can easily fix that in post processing. On the other hand, making the oversaturated shots of the Lumia 920 look natural wasn't really possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only part of the Nokia Lumia 925 shots that we are not particularly enthusiastic about is the contrast. It tends to be rather low with the smartphone trying way too hard to preserve tiny highlight patches and shadow areas and ending up with a bit flat looking shot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive 1080p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's. You can control the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 shoots 1080p and 720p videos (720p is the default mode). The OIS comes into play here if you're holding the phone in your hand (we doubt many people carry tripods around).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have excellent detail and very nice colors. The framerate is perfectly smooth and dynamic range is quite decent as well. The OIS contributes a great deal to the overall quality when shooting handheld as it reduces the unpleasant shaking of your hand. Continuous autofocus behaved well, too, adding up to very impressive overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bitrate of the 1080p video was around 20 Mbps while the framerate hovered around the 30 fps mark. The Lumia 925 has a two high-dynamic range microphone setup (meaning it can capture loud sounds without distortion) but even so audio is recorded in mono only (96Kbps, 44.1kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 720p videos the bitrate fell to around 16 Mbps with the same 30 fps framerate. Audio is mono again too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a 1080p sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA and 4G LTE connectivity (there are two versions of the phone with a different set of LTE bands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in range of an LTE network, the 925 will do up to 100Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 3.0. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager (although a third party app is now in its beta testing stages) and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 925 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 925 on top of it and will charge it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on the Lumia is the classic Windows Phone 8 deal, which has hardly changed with the minor update of the OS. The Lumia 925 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing and the 332ppi pixel density keeps text sharp even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer browser on the Nokia Lumia 925 had the same great SunSpider and Browsermark performance as its predecessor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 925 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing offers more than just web results though - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Local Scout now integrated into the places section of Nokia Maps, there are now two search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is the camera scanner, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The second is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is higher than 165,000, and while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps on the other platforms are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 don't work on the older versions but all of the older apps are compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, or the windowsphone.com website, from where you can push apps to your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HERE Maps and Drive+ get a makeover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a high-end Lumia smartphone, the 925 gets the Drive+ navigation suite for free out of box. Unlike Drive available on lower-end Lumias, Drive+ has global coverage, meaning it can easily be used abroad. And since it's available offline you don't have to worry about roaming data charges, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive+ offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive+ you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive+ uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most recent update to the HERE suite (from just this month) adds an overview of traffic conditions in your area, including your drive to and from work with the My Commute app. My Commute shows you an at-a-glance look at your specified commute with a special Live Tile on your homescreen. You can setup up multiple commutes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest release, the former Local Scout and City Lens features have been integrated into the Places section of HERE Maps, and gives you a quick view of restaurants, shops, galleries and other POIs around you, including an augmented reality view via the camera called LiveSight. Tapping the virtual signs in the camera interface pops up more info about the place, as well as directions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been eight months since the release of the Lumia 920. At that time, the great design and updated WP8 build, complete with Nokia customizations and exclusive apps, resulted in one of the best smartphones representing the platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much has changed in the time between that launch and the Lumia 925 we have today. The introduction of the Lumia 1020 is perhaps the most significant development, although that matters mostly to photography purists that want the best possible image quality from their smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New flagships and camera interfaces aside, the user experience you'll get is largely the same as what the Lumia 920 offered more than half a year ago. Even the rebranded HERE Maps and Drive+ global navigation suite is no longer a Lumia exclusive, as Nokia have made it available (for a price) to other WP8-powered handsets in the Windows Phone Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So with such marginal software updates (which the Lumia 920 will also get) aside, what it really comes down to with the Lumia 925 is the updated exterior and the new 6-element camera lens. The improved image quality along with the AMOLED screen, aluminum frame, and resultant thinner and significantly lighter body are all marked improvements over the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, how much will those improvements actually run you? Currently, the Lumia 925 retails at around &#x20ac;500. This is significantly more than the Lumia 920, which can be had for around &#x20ac;325. So while the 925 is definitely a better smartphone, we can't in any way recommend paying such a premium for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all if you must have Nokia's cream of the crop then the just-announced Lumia 1020 is the only way to go, anyway. It features an incredible 41MP PureView camera, complete with a huge sensor OIS and Nokia's very easy-to-use and intuitive Pro Cam Lens. However, besides doubling up the RAM to 2GB, all the other internals are identical, so there isn't much of a performance difference between that and the Lumia 925. The real kicker, though, is the price. The Nokia Lumia 1020 is currently up for preorder for AT&amp;T in the US for $660 unsubsidized, which translates to only slightly more than the Lumia 925.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If, however, you want to go easy on your wallet, and don't want to lug around a hefty device like the Lumia 920, there are a couple of viable alternatives. The Samsung ATIV S and HTC Windows Phone 8X both offer Windows Phone 8 for less than even the Lumia 920, with the ATIV even giving you a bigger screen and larger battery. And we can't reiterate enough that the formerly exclusive-to-Nokia mapping and global navigation suite is now available, to these devices as well. It's even free of charge in North America, as well as the UK, Germany, Spain, France and Italy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Ativ S I8750 &#x2022; HTC Windows Phone 8X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately, if premium feel on the Windows Phone platform is what you're after, and you don't like a jutting camera sensor dominating the back of your device, then the Nokia Lumia 925 is your best bet. It addresses two of the biggest issues people had with the former flagship, bulk and weight, and the AMOLED display's ability to turn off pixels lends itself really well to the predominantly black Windows Phone interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pricing is its biggest Achilles' heel, though, as it's hard to justify paying over &#x20ac;150 more for a Lumia 920 with a redesigned body, especially with competitor alternatives hovering at half the price! More than likely, the release of the Lumia 1020 will take most of the wind out of the 925's sales (sic), so to speak, which may force it into a more accessible midrange market.</paragraph>
