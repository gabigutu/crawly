			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Incredibly Fast and About to Take Off written across their flag, Huawei took this year's MWC by a storm. Firing up on all cores - four of them, in case you've missed it - they pinned themselves emphatically on the Android map with an impressive new lineup of smartphones and a shocker of a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their rise didn't happen overnight of course. And although we're about to look back at a less glorious chapter of their history, phones like the Vision and the Honor deserve credit for helping the company get where they're now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what about the Huawei Vision? Incredibly like an HTC Desire S and About as Smart makes a good motto. Come on, the Vision is no droid if it can't take a joke. And by the way, it looks strong enough to take a beating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vision reports to the Honor in the previous generation of the Huawei Android lineup. By far the better-equipped smartphone, the Honor was let down by a stark lack of style. The Huawei Vision must've been quick to grab the chance. Not that it's propelled to staggering heights of finesse but the unibody design is a source of strength and credibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vision risks being soon overshadowed by its younger and more gifted siblings, and faces frightening competition. No one can reasonably expect Samsung, HTC, LG and Sony Ericsson to be nice to newcomers. With dual-core phones becoming more and more affordable, the Vision needs to be prepared to battle some tegra 2-yeilding brutes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Vision looks good and is more than decently equipped to be a trusty day-to-day companion or your first smartphone to learn the basics with. All it needs is the right price and an audience to make happy. It has all our attention. Let's see if it can keep it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Vision 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Vision is one of the more compact phones to feature a 3.7" display. At 118 x 59.9 x 9.9 mm, it's a good fit in the hand. The slim unibody is very pleasant and comfortable to hold, and reasonably lightweight at 121 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Huawei Vision, parallels to the HTC Desire S are inevitable. Thanks to the unibody design, the overall look and feel are too similar to ignore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But once you're past the first impression, you'll see that there are some major differences, especially at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're pleased with the ergonomics of the Vision - it's compact and easy to operate, while it still manages to offer respectable screen real estate. For comparison's sake, the Vision is shorter than an iPhone but offers a bigger, 3.7" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to its Huawei siblings, the vision fits right between the Honor and the Sonic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vision's LCD screen has WVGA (480 x 800) resolution and pixel density of 255 ppi. The contrast was a pleasant surprise but the screen is a little short of brightness. Add the reflective coating and you get less than stellar outdoor visibility. Other than that, this could easily rate as an above average screen and we're happy with its behavior indoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display you'll find four capacitive keys for Menu, Home, Back and Search. They light up upon touch and are placed at a safe distance from the touchscreen to not get in the way. Above the screen there's a video call camera, a proximity sensor to disable the screen during calls and an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is bare - exactly like in the HTC Desire S, whose unibody styling the Vision uses as an inspiration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you'll find a single-piece volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the Vision disagrees with the original is the USB port placement. The HTC Desire S has it on the side, a position, which favors landscape use. On the Vision, the microUSB port for both charging and file transfers is at the bottom. That's where the mouthpiece is too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation at the back of the Vision. That's where we find the speaker grille, the 5 MP camera lens and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic bit at the bottom slides open to reveal the SIM card compartment and microSD slot. As soon as you pop the cover off, the phone shuts down automatically, meaning the microSD card slot isn't hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vision is a very pleasant device to hold and operate. It has a nice solid feel - we wouldn't call it premium but reassuring and seemingly durable. We liked the compact size too. Those who aren't too obsessed with smartphone display size will be more than happy with the Vision's 3.7" touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unibody borrowed from HTC is nothing fresh or original but the Vision doesn't feel like a cheap replica. It's lucky to do without the cheap gloss of the Huawei Honor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3D user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unable to match the Honor's level of customizations, the Huawei Vision settles for a ready-made solution. The preloaded SPB Shell 3D launcher is the only major add-on to what's mostly stock Android. You naturally have plenty of other custom launchers to choose from but there's the SPB Shell 3D .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface demo video to get things started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SPB Shell 3D offers a fluid and very customizable UI experience with up to 11 different screens. You can set any of them to be the main homescreen. The custom launcher comes with its own custom widgets to go with the standard Android set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing items on the homescreen is simple to do and the custom SPB widgets do live up to their 3D name in the visually rich and smoothly animated interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called Carousel is an overview of all available homescreen panes. A dedicated button placed at the bottom of the screen launches the Carousel preview and lets you switch between screens, rearrange them, set different background colors, rename or get rid of the unneeded ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area really feels like pulling the blind - so stark is the contrast between stock Android and the rich visuals of the custom launcher. You get all current connections and new notifications displayed but there're no quick toggles for Wi-Fi, screen rotation, Bluetooth, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Vision is standard Android too. A swipe to the right unlocks the phone while swiping in the opposite direction toggles silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is a vertically scrollable grid. You can't reorder icons, which are sorted alphabetically. It's not the best way if you're used to seeing your latest downloads at the top or bottom. All apps that have had their shortcuts pinned to any of the homescreen panes are marked with a small Home icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SPB Shell 3D launcher offers options for the background color of your screens, along with other visual tweaks, including a stereoscopic mode, which is utterly useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all it's a nice custom launcher with plenty of options and full of eye candy. What we didn't like about it is that it tends to feel cramped on a smaller screen. Homescreens appear crowded and can be disorientating.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The good thing is the custom SPB Shell launcher doesn't slow things down, not a bit. The Huawei Vision is not the fastest piece of smartphone to begin with, running a single-core 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU with Adreno 205 and 512 MB RAM. This is duly reflected in its benchmark scores, but the important thing is we didn't experience any frustrating lags.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Beyond the deeply-customized entrance, the Vision is quick to retreat to the familiar territory of vanilla Android. The stock phonebook is a good example of this - although the functionality is of course intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we missed is the Stream feature of the Huawei Honor, which displayed Twitter and Facebook feeds by your contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vision held on to signal without trouble and audio was good on both ends of calls. Just like the Honor, it doesn't have video calls out of the box. Apps like Tango or Skype can be a way around this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer app hasn't got smart dialing enabled either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we liked about the Huawei Vision was its top notch loudspeaker. You'll have no trouble hearing the ring of an incoming call with this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Input method<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard on the Huawei Vision has seen some changes and now looks like the one on the updated final version of the Honor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's slightly more elaborate than the regular old Android keyboard and features three shortcuts on either side of the space bar, instead of the more common two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Huawei Vision too is different from the one on the Honor. It lacks most of the eye candy and some of the functionality. It's the stock Android version that we haven't seen for quite a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is lacking in visualizations and there are no equalizers preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search by tapping and holding down on a song's name. The YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an alphabet scroll on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output too quiet to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei U8850 Vision is easily among the quietest smartphones we have subjected to our audio quality test. If you are the kind of guy to attach huge headphones to your smartphone and push the volume all the way up until your ears start bleeding, you better look elsewhere. And once we've got that out of the way, we can say that the Vision's output is decently clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as impressive as most high-end droids or the iPhone, when attached to an active external amplifier, but the Vision isn't too bad either. The good to very good readings that it got in the first part of the test should be enough for most of the users out there anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pretty glad to find out that there wasn't much degradation when headphones come into play. Some hardly detectable intermodulation distortion comes up and the stereo crosstalk goes up an average amount and that's that. It could certainly be better, but not by much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Vision has a 5 MP camera for maximum image resolution of 2592??1944 pixels. There's a single LED flash to go with it, as well as geotagging and HDR functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is stock Gingerbread. Almost every big Android manufacturer has a better custom solution, but this is not the case at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offered settings are okay. You get exposure, HDR and Flash settings among others, but ISO and White Balance are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth mentioning that our Vision unit had obvious issues with focus, probably due to its pre-release status. But we expect the Vision to offer nice quality pictures as it offers good detail where focus is okay and noise is kept in check with nice colors. The Vision does a decent job and we've got several camera samples to show.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a single-core processor, the Huawei Vision is capable of 720p video capture at 30 fps at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder UI is the same as the still camera's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are nothing to be excited about. The 3gp video container compares poorly to mp4. The actual resolution of the videos isn't very impressive. They are smooth but detail is low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We repeatedly compared the Huawei Vision to a year-old package. Similarities with the HTC Desire S are too many to ignore. The unibody design is just the tip of the iceberg. The two handsets are nearly identical on the inside too. It almost feels like Huawei were skimming through the competition until someone pointed at the Desire S and said "Let's do that one".</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, we can think of quite a few year-old phones that can do as well or better than the Huawei Vision. But the Vision itself isn't exactly brand new. It's our bad actually. We had it lying around for a while and it got pushed down the pecking order over and over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Huawei Vision is well-built, good-looking and reasonably spec'd but that does not a smartphone hit make. The good news for Huawei is that they've got the smartphone hits duly covered as of late. Which means the Vision could safely focus on the lower midrange and not worry about what's to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One likely rival to keep an eye on is the Samsung Galaxy W. The Samsung Galaxy Ace and Ace Plus are good alternatives too, especially if you want to save a few bills. The Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo V is also worth a look if you want to get the most out of a tight budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy W I8150 &#x2022; LG SU420 Cafe &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 &#x2022; Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get more serious with affordable dual-cores keen to raise the stakes. The LG Optimus 2X has been around for a while and costs about the same as the Huawei Vision. The Vision is way out of its depth against the ex-flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while the LG Optimus 2X looks like the straightforward choice for its speed, performance and cameraphone credentials, the rest of the competitors get their edge mostly from a higher level of brand awareness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, a change - albeit slow - is under way. The impressive showing Huawei had in Barcelona may put phones like the Vision back on the radar. The Huawei Vision is still a decent option in the lower midrange and one that can do a good job as someone's first smartphone. The difference is - and it's a big one - that it's safe to like it. And if you like it enough to stick around, Huawei will be more than happy to discuss your upgrade options.</paragraph>
