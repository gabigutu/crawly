			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the beginning there was G1: the frontline trooper, the mean machine, the expendable GI. Elsewhere, in the HTC discourse, it was hope and vision. Well, it seems the dreamer's Dream is coming true and someone there is really proud with what they've done. HTC Hero is perhaps the most advanced Android to date. And the OS is probably the closest the competition has ever come to the iPhone's touchscreen revelation. The bold lines of the HTC Hero are just a hint at its superior hardware and when it comes to homescreen kit and widgets, it definitely has an edge even over the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC and their Hero are finally bringing the fledgling new Android OS up to speed and up to par. Not that a Hero is badly needed to save the day for either HTC or the Android OS, but inspiration is always welcome. Having made their name in Windows Mobile, HTC probably most appreciate the creative break from the Microsoft mobile OS that's become a habit (and a curse) for them. It would be too much to call it a plan B, but after all business is propelled by competition - even if it's household.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the HTC Hero brings even more style to the Android family. Breaking with the full QWERTY heritage but keeping the trademark angled chin, the Hero continues the tradition of slim full-touch phones much along the lines of HTC Magic that we also recently reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But today's story is a Hero's tale, and you can bet we've got one here to inspect. Let's kick it off with a rundown of the key specs and the main letdowns that we've found so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero is hitting the shelves in two main colors - white and brown. The white is said to have the supposed advantage of some sort of super duper Teflon coating. No, it won't cook more healthy food for you but should keep away dirt and fingerprints alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brown variety purportedly doesn't have this kind of coating, but we can't really comment on that having not seen both paintjobs. No matter what color you choose however, the frame around the display is finished in very classy brushed aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if it so happens that black's what turns you on, the HTC Hero borne on the T-Mobile waves, a.k.a. T-Mobile G2 Touch, has only recently been announced and it's got that delightfully exclusive black armor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, black, white or brown, we sure plan to have the Android reveal its true color. We got the white-clad Hero to test and, as you can guess, we're more than eager to jot down all the little bits and pieces that make it stand out of the Android crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Heroes are made and unmade in the blink of an eye but telling their story right sure takes longer. So, there we go - follow us to the hero's chamber?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Few surprises in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the HTC Magic, the retail package of the HTC Hero is quite neatly shaped. As to contents, the essentials are well taken care of, with a few bonuses on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the mandatory charger and a miniUSB cable. There's no sign of the stylish white leather carrying pouch that shipped with the Magic (the Hero is a hard one to cut a suit for), but the 2GB microSD card is here alright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get quite a tasteful wired stereo handsfree - a one-piece kit - but if you want to listen to music on third-party headphones, the standard 3.5mm audio jack of the Hero says you're welcome. We guess you'd probably go for a third-party set anyways, as we're not quite content with the output of the Hero's own headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Hero 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero shares the rectangular design of the HTC Touch Diamond2 and has even borrowed the quite pleasant brushed aluminum front. It has an Android touch too keeping the angular chin of the T-Mobile G1. In a nutshell, we're pretty sold on the HTC Hero design, no doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 112 x 56.2 x 14.4 mm, the HTC Hero is not the most compact or the thinnest smartphone around, but it's sure to impress. The build quality is also near perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 135 g is perhaps a notch above the class average but grants an extra solid feel in hand. For a sizeable touchscreen, the HTC Hero handles very comfortably, no issues for singlehanded thumbing around the interface. The trackball is comfortably raised too thanks to the chin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We quite like the angular bottom of the HTC Hero and we dare say the tilted chin looks even better on a handset that's notably thinner than the T-Mobile G1/HTC Dream. The Teflon coating said to cover the white variety of the Hero was quite intriguing too - we're usually quite a bored gang looking to get a thrill of something radically new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of HTC Hero, the Teflon thingy certainly sounded like stuff worthy of a full page alone. Well, in reality the extra special new finish isn't all that fascinating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sure looks like premium matt plastic: almost rubbery to the touch providing excellent grip, but in the end it's plastic and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whew, now that we've got it sorted (so much for the page or so), we can safely move on to the display frame, which, if you ask us, is as sleek as it gets. We can't really help but praise the fine brushed aluminum surface. Hopefully, we're not making some sort of fetish out of it, are we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways that said, the central piece on the front is the touchscreen display as usual. The 65K-color capacitive touchscreen of HVGA resolution (320 x 480 pixels) is pretty much standard Android issue. Measuring 3.2 inches in diagonal as pretty much all other Android devices by HTC, the display pretty much meets all our requirements for sensitivity, colors, brightness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as sunlight legibility is concerned, the HTC Hero fares just like the HTC Magic. It's close to the iPhone unmatched screen but is still more reflective and that can get in the way at times. Overall, the HTC displays used for Android phones seem way better than those on WinMo handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you'll find several hardware controls, the trackball taking charge of course. It's not so usual to find a trackball or a D-pad on a touchscreen device, but HTC and Android seem to be quite fond of that and we gotta admit they have a point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, trackball navigation is certainly one of our favorites. It might not be as usable as a D-pad for gaming but at its full-time job it's quick, intuitive and pleasing. The trackball implementation on the HTC Hero is very good, quite on par with BlackBerry devices. Of course, it would've been even better to have adjustable trackball speed like on them Berries, but we're pushing it too far already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the controls below the display are exactly the same as those on the HTC Magic, they're just arranged in a different fashion. We could've used a little larger keys and a wee bit more of press feedback, but they are hardly a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're interested in Android, you probably already know what each of these keys does, but here's the rundown anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu key is usually used to unlock the screen and launch various context-dependent options across the interface, while the main menu itself is handled exclusively via the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home key always takes you to the main homescreen, while a press-and-hold opens the multitasking manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Back button is self-explanatory, and so are the Send and End keys. Perhaps the only interesting thing here is the End key, which actually turns off the screen and locks it - it's also used to power the handset on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search knob is an interesting thingy as there's hardly a similar key on competing smartphone platforms. Other than starting a Google search form for making hassle-free Google searches on the go, it also offers a variety of context dependent searches. It will search your contacts in the phonebook, mail messages and contacts, artists in the music library, even POI's on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing our tour around the Hero, the right-hand side is pretty bare. That is if you don't count the microSD slot, which is there, but is hidden under the battery cover. You can still hot-swap cards if you need to, but you have to remove the cover every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot supports cards of up to 16 gigs and we found a 2GB card in our retail package (that of course can be market and carrier specific).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing we miss the most here on the right side is a dedicated camera key. Much like with the Magic and Touch Diamond 2, there's no shutter key here. Instead you use the Hero's trackball. As much as we like the trackball, it's hardly a handy shutter key as there's no way for it to accommodate half-press for autofocus. So, once you've framed and locked focus you can't skip the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand part of the HTC Hero is also quite bare with the sole exception of the volume rocker. Much in contrast with the overly thin volume key on the Magic, the one here is big, and wobbly, and all plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, on the bottom of the phone, you will see the standard miniUSB port used for plugging a charger, headset or a data cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top there's a nice surprise - the standard 3.5mm audio jack allows you to plug any standard set of headphones to enjoy your music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera is on the back - again there's no flash, LED or xenon, to boost low light performance. The camera doesn't have any lens cover either, so you better keep an eye on it or it will scratch in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the plastic battery cover you can spot the 1350 mAh Li-Ion battery. The manufacturer claims up to 750 h of standby time and up to 7h of talk time - all in a 3G network. During the intensive testing of the phone for this review, we had to recharge daily, but that's hardly what you may consider "normal usage pattern".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've paid attention so far, you'd already know that we're quite fond of the HTC Hero looks and we find its construction solid enough and generally quite suiting its high-end status. The Hero is hardly the slimmest phone around, yet its size is not a burden and the hand feel is great. The nudge at the bottom gives it a charm of its own, plus the handset shapes quite naturally and comfortably around your face while talking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: brilliant, though few finishing touches short<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC must have a team of developers locked up somewhere underground and only given meals when they get things right. If that has even distant connection to the reality, they must've been treated to a feast upon completion of the Hero user interface project.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It used to be just TouchFLO, but enter Sense UI. Simply put, Sense UI is a cross between TouchFLO and the stock Android interface, but at the same time, it's neither of those. Some changes are purely ornamental, while others profoundly affect the way you work with you mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow button at the bottom of the screen that used to pull the main menu up is now replaced with three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu (this time around, you simply tap - you can't drag the Main Menu out, though you can drag it back in). The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Add to Home" menu. And there's plenty to add to the homescreen but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen is on - it can't be used for actual scrolling. HTC have extended the homescreen to seven partitions instead of the usual three. Even if it sounds too much, with all those widgets (which are quite useful too) it may not even be enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Welcome to the scene<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the most important novelties is the addition of scenes, which are essentially six custom desktop setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't modify the scenes but if you rearrange the current homescreen you are prompted to save changes as a new scene. The Clean slate scene in turn lets you start from scratch - it's just the default Android setup with a Clock and a few shortcuts underneath. Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization - the business and personal mode that other phones offer seems quite a limited solution compared to scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are far from perfect though: the Travel scene has the HTC Footprints widget but nothing on GPS or maps. Unfortunately, you cannot edit the default scenes. Your only option is to save a new modified Travel scene under a different name along with the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changes to the UI that Sense brings go deeper than just the homescreen. For example, the main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch it to a list similar to what you see in TouchFLO. With it, you can use kinetic scrolling or an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Homescreen widgets change the ruls of the game<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When adding a widget to the homescreen you are faced with two options - Android widgets (the stock widgets) and HTC widgets. HTC are obviously quite proud of what they've achieved and with good reason. A neat HTC solution is the Settings widgets - simple switches that turn things like Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions - most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget, different look (There are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!) and some even offer different functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the Twitter widget for instance - one version also shows updates for the people you follow, while the other version only lets you tweet from the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC widgets offer a better level of interaction than the stock widgets - there's a Favorites widget that keeps a list of your favorite contacts you can scroll through, no need to get to the contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo album widget is a "stack" of photos that shows all the photos in some folder and you can flick them to view the next photo in line. This is quite fun but the experience is somewhat ruined by optimization - during the animation of the photo going up and the next one settling in, the widget uses low resolution previews of the photos and it takes a couple of seconds for the next image to fully load. Larger photos suffer the most from this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages and Mail widgets work much the same way, but instead of photos, you flick messages. And you don't get the pixilation issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way widgets are moved around on the homescreen has changed too. A green rectangle marks the area the widget will occupy while the rest of the background is faded. If the current section of the homescreen is full, a message urges you to move the widget to another section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is generally fast but at times it would become frustratingly slow. Like when you access a microSD card with a lot of image folders. It's not that it takes a while to open the folder, but the couple of seconds lag before the Hero would continue registering taps that is so disappointing - a "Loading?" sign is better than a frozen screen with no indication of what's going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the Sense solutions are not as positive - on the homescreen the trackball is only good for scrolling desktops, you no longer can select anything with it. Tapping a shortcut is of course faster than selecting it with the trackball but this change is a little limiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more things - most apps won't run without a microSD card inserted and screen vibration feedback works on the virtual QWERTY keyboard but not elsewhere throughout the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just wait to see what they've done with the phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook synergy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You've probably heard of Palm's new WebOS - and one of its most touted features - Synergy. Well, HTC have their own take at the concept, which is reminiscent of the way TouchFLO displays contact info but with plenty of additions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a contact's details presents you with the basic info for the contact - name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs at the bottom and you're just viewing the first tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the SMS messages received from the contact - it'd have been a lot more useful if it held the entire conversation, but for that you have to go to the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact. The next two tabs are quite interesting and can turn the Hero (or in fact any phone running the Sense UI) into a social networking power tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts and favorite contacts tabs, as well as a call log, groups and "Updates and events". The latter holds updates for all your Facebook contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen has been reskinned. It looks closer to the Dream concept rather than the Magic. There's no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy - just press the search button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality in calls is good and the volume is louder than the Magic's. Reception is quite good as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features a keypad and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad) and also sports Smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the HTC Magic, the Hero has an interesting feature you'll notice when you make your first call - it vibrates when your call is connected. That's a good way to let you know the other side has picked up if you hold the phone in your hand and not to your ear. But if you do hold it to your ear - then it's just irritating. It would have been great if it were disabled automatically by a proximity sensor for example. Unfortunately we didn't find an option to at least switch it off manually either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows the latest dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero doesn't have voice dialing, even though previous handsets had it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging takes a step back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. Google Talk is in charge of instant messaging. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard in the HTC Hero works in both portrait and landscape modes. The individual button size is decent and sensitivity is better than the Magic, though there are still problems with the edges of the screen - often it takes several taps before it registers a press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Androids, if you have only one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the SMS section is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads. Each thread is labeled by the names of the recipients and shows the number of messages in the thread and part of the last message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like with the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 10 or fewer characters remaining to the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as,the text box only takes a small part of the screen even if you hide the keyboard, which really only gives you little to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. In the Magic, the list of recipients was kept in a "Name 

 " format (e.g. "Mandark &lt;123-456&gt;") but the Hero shows only names for the contacts from the phonebook and just the number for others. 
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magic way was better because if a contact has several numbers you can see which one you're about to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsent messages are marked with a warning sign, but draft messages that used to stay in the thread with a red "Draft" label next to them, are now kept separately in the dedicated Draft section. This makes continuing drafts harder. In the Magic, text in the compose box was kept right there instead of forcing the user to go back to the Drafts folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as forward and delete as well as view details. The options to copy the text of a message or edit a message have been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There are two email clients on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much since the Magic. There are a few HTC add-ons, but nothing major. Batch operations, which debuted on the HTC Magic, allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slighly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The scrolling speed has also been increased compared to Android v1.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or HTC mail, and set one of the two options as default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, it's kinda hard to talk native / non-native email clients on the Hero as Gmail is native to Android and HTC Mail is native to ? well, HTC. Anyway, the coexistence of a Gmail and a standard HTC email app is no news since the Magic and the reason is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been tweaked up compared to the Magic. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages. At the bottom there are three virtual buttons that change the inbox view to display conversations or only the emails with attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversations view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the standard inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand. Attachments are not automatically loaded by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Hero lacks in terms of email capabilities. What you basically have is a local copy of your Gmail account bundled with its main functionality plus a Microsoft Exchange compatible alternative client, which can manage multiple POP and IMAP accounts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia reskinned<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playing was the big news in the HTC Magic, and now the Hero brings a totally rehashed image gallery called Albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery has a new main menu list-with-thumbnail structure to replace the old grid view. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder - quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery undertakes reindexing of the content each time you open it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. And that's a bugger as when cards are full of content, it's quite slow to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a number indicating the count of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. No sign of the camera shortcut that we found so comfortable in the HTC Magic's main gallery. It is only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons - one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and finally - Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images and share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Hero image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip view. You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero supports multi-touch and you can take the full advantage of this while browsing your images. Zooming in and out is done in the same fashion as on the Apple iPhone. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen. And unlike the LG recent implementation, the one here is extra smooth - just as it is on the iPhone (and those are 5 megapixel images we're talking about here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And turning to video...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums' subfolder as there is no separate icon for the video player in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared via Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application of HTC Hero has seen some cosmetic changes, but is still quite basic. The only new addition is the full screen mode, where the original clip is stretched / cropped to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite as expected, the player is capable of playing only 3GP and MP4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the go HTC Hero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you intend to do a lot of video watching on the Hero you should be warned that for some reason almost all the MP4 videos we tried were played quite choppy. We guess there's some software reason behind that, as the 528MHz CPU should be capable enough to cope with those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As our tests confirmed, any video with a resolution larger than QVGA (25fps) is quite unusable due to the performance stutter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player only looks new<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with the rest of the multimedia department, the music player is also totally redesigned, but there are no new features inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find no contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff in YouTube or Google. The other music player weaknesses of the Android platform still need addressing too - no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is passable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero has tolerable audio quality but if most certainly won't be able to blow your mind away. Much like with the HTC Magic, the noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk are the strong points of its performance but the rest of the readings are somewhat below-par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shaky frequency response suggests that the hardware still has much room for improvement. The distortion levels which are several times higher than those of the Apple iPhone 3GS also come to confirm that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To summarize, if you aren't too demanding the HTC Hero might do the trick for you. In all other cases feel free to join the Apple bandwagon. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero is equipped with a 5 megapixel autofocus camera for a maximum image resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. Missing any flash whatsoever strongly suggests that you'd better not count on it in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple enough and at first glance quite resembles the iPhone's. There is a camera/camcorder switch and a gallery button. The trackball serves as a shutter key. We would have preferred a dedicated shutter key with half-press action, but perhaps that's just us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the viewfinder on screen reveals the digital zoom bar on the left. Hitting the "Menu" reveals five buttons on a tab at the bottom of the screen, the latter leading to an advanced settings menu. There you can set the metering mode, sharpness, saturation and contrast of the photos and you can add a viewfinder gridline to assist your framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick settings appearing in the viewfinder handle image resolution, white balance and brightness. You can also activate a self-timer (2 to 10 second lag) from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can guess the available options are quite outdated as there's no sign of stuff such as face, smile or blink detection, automatic panoramic modes, full resolution burst shooting modes and other modern stuff that have been making their way to cellphone cameras for quite some time now. At least geotagging of photos is available as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero image quality is quite good for a 5 MP shooter. It produces satisfying enough photos with good amount of resolved detail. The colors aren't tuned so well and they are represented cooler than they are in reality and there is a bit over sharpening at some places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely we have seen better (the recent Nokia 6700 and 6720 classic, for instance), but there's no major flaw here. There is no purple fringing and the dynamic range seems rather good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The things that need some further adjustment are the white balance and the over sharpening issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC Hero. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the HTC Hero fails to deliver as much detail as the Nokia N97, but it quite matches the Samsung S8000 levels. Still the difference between the Hero and N97 isn't too great so it probably won't even be noticeable in most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>CIF video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite disappointingly, the HTC Hero is capable of recording CIF video with 15 fps, which isn't something to write home about really. It still is better than nothing (remember the G1 back in the day or the unmodified Apple iPhone 3G), but it hardly qualifies as high-end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We frowned at the Nokia N86 8MP for its VGA@30fps video recording, so you may guess we're already spoiled by the bunch of D1-res recording Samsung and LG phones. We quite expect something along those lines from every high-end device out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera's. It sports a setting for picking between MP4 and 3GP (H.263) encoding, which theoretically should give you the choice between smaller file and a higher-quality video. In practice the low resolution makes sure that the differences aren't really so obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a HTC Hero video sample to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero offers 7.2Mpbs HSDPA, 2 Mbps HSUPA, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0. The handset features quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA support, as well as USB 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing the connectivity options can be done via the Main Menu by looking up Wireless controls under Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the new Sense UI implemented in the Hero, there are quick homescreen widgets for turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on or off. If you have already configured wireless networks or previously paired devices, they will be connected automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi support is excellent. It's very easy to get running, with no need to dig through the menus or meddle with various settings. Just click on the desired network, type a password if needed and there you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth support is far from being so good though. It's limited to headset use and does not support file transfers. Those disadvantages can be addressed by gaining access as "root" to the OS files - the popularly called "rooting". We'll say more about that in the Tweaks&amp;Modding section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the HTC Hero comes with A2DP support, which allows streaming music to a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing your data couldn't be easier - it's just that you mainly sync with the Google services. For those of you who prefer desktop syncing with Outlook or Outlook Express, the HTC Sync comes in handy. It is a nice tool for quick syncing your contacts and calendar events with PC (Outlook) and works just fine for both Magic and Hero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of its connectivity suite, the HTC Hero also has a standard 3.5mm audio jack. There's no TV-out functionality though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hero can be used as a USB 3G modem under Windows. You need to connect your device to a PC with HTC Sync installed. When done, you should enable the ?Mobile network sharing? setting in the Wireless Controls menu of the Hero. Your Windows OS will do the rest and you?ll be ready to use the Hero as a wireless 3G modem. Unfortunately, the whole tethering thing is not available over Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Probably among the best full touch browsers out there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero is the first Android device to pack any Flash support. The browser will run animated banners, Flash games and other web content just like on a regular computer. We had no problems with the desktop YouTube either except for the naggingly choppy playback, regardless of the god Wi-Fi connection. That again hints us of some underlying software video playback issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have even gone further adding multi-touch support for the popular "pinch" zoom. So, the Hero is not only the first Flash-enabled Android, but also the first with multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hero's browser is fast and the interface clean. The application is based on the same open source WebKit platform as Mobile Safari and the browser of S60 and recent S40 Nokia phones. You can bet that promises some nice user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages load quickly, and thumb navigation is just as smooth and easy as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is as easy as on the iPhone and just as fluid. There is almost no lag and the browser handles the changes to the page view very smoothly. There's even a form auto complete functionality, password manager much like desktop browsers (and a certain phone made by Apple).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the option to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves nice smooth transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser handled perfectly most of the pages we threw at it and we are very satisfied with the results. The capacitive screen securing the browser's fluid response along with multi-touch make surfing on the Hero a real pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hero web browser may as well bid for current best-mobile-web-browser title. It's probably the first time we see a full touch web browser match the iPhone and thanks to the Flash support and the nice download manager, it even outdoes the iPhone Mobile Safari browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's still some work to do though, and we hope the promised Flash 10 update will come soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero's elder, the T-Mobile G1, was condemned for the lack of a document viewer - a must for every smartphone, especially in this price range. Since the Magic though, the available free Quickoffice and the PDF viewers make sure you can read office documents stored in the phone's memory, the microSD card or received via email. Editing isn't possible at this stage but this is still a step forward for the Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once all the files supported by the viewer are found and displayed everything goes extra smooth. You just have to wait a bit until the file indexing is finished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike HTC Magic, where e-mailed office documents or PDF files can be displayed and forwarded but not saved, Hero does it all (including saving attached documents and images on the memory card). Attaching saved files is possible as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, monthly and today. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to remind you of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator available (almost the same as the one we found in Magic). It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and very comfortable. The only difference from the Magic's calculator is the missing landscape support but it's not that much of a loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another improvement over the predecessors is the now preloaded voice recorder. Its interface looks nice and is simple enough to make voice recordings a breeze. Files are saved in .amr format. You can browse, hear and delete previous recordings. This application isn't capable of sending files directly after they have been recorded but there are enough alternatives just a few clicks away in the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is accessible right on the homescreen - just tap on the clock. There you'll also find the stopwatch and the countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Hero lacks a preinstalled To-Do app you can download one of the many found in the Android Market. It won't take more than a minute.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that the only application you can rely on for navigation right out of the box is Google Maps. The only difference from the version we saw in Magic are the added walk capabilities (not really much more than route planning for pedestrians).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, multi-touch doesn't work in Google Maps; double tapping won't do either. To zoom in and out you use the two virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen. These are hidden when not in use and only appear when you touch the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first we thought that the Street View mode isn't available anymore because it was missing from the modes list. It took a tap-and-hold on the screen for this option to get revealed. Aren't we glad to see it again! As usual, you can enjoy the sweet 3D view of the area, which the trackball controls with impressive fluidity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation isn't available on Google Maps. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your goal sometimes? assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already several ways around that. One of them, called  CoPilot Live, offers 2D and 3D maps for North America and Europe, turn-by-turn voice guided navigation, portrait and landscape mode support as well as many more goodies. Once you purchase it you can download the needed maps and save them on a memory card so you won't have to worry about data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are looking for a free navigation app, take a look at the AndNav2. It offers decent turn-by-turn navigation. The voice-guided part, however, is questionable - to use it you need an extra, free app (Text-To-Speech Library) which supports English along with many other languages. Text-to-speech instead of pre-recorded voices means a horrible computer voice but the app will still do the job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being an open-source OS, Android was sure to attract a lot of modder attention. You can tweak an Android phone beyond recognition - you just have to know how. However, not everyone will be comfortable flashing their brand new handset costing them their hard earned cash, but if they do they'd be getting more than what they paid for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense UI has really empowered the Hero, with multi-touch support and tethering (out of the box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, things like Bluetooth file transfer or changing ROMs and recovery images are enough to make you think of gaining root access ( the so-called "rooting") to your new HTC Hero Android OS. Of course, the coin has two sides, so be sure to check out what you might get and what you might lose if you decide to root your Hero after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what does rooting exactly mean? Normally, there are some functions that are enabled in the phone's hardware but the software just can handle. A simple example: Hero would normally support Bluetooth file transfer but it's software-locked. Basically, the one-time process of rooting gives you full control over your phone OS and allows you to remove all those restrictions set by defaullt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the xda-developers forum is your best source for more information on the matter.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market: giving you more by the day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero comes with a few useful preinstalled applications - Google Maps, the Quickoffice, the PDF viewer and YouTube app. Others include Google Talk (its name says it all), Peep (app for access to Twitter's services), Stocks, HTC Footprints and the weather forecast app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Footprints app allows you to geo-tag images and save them in diverse categories such as favorites, shopping, dining, etc accompanied by a personal note. Once you take a picture of a place you can look up its address and location using Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather application is also accessible using the dedicated widget. It not only has very attractive interface but is quite useful as well. As you might guess, access to internet is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero also packs a YouTube app, which may sound kinda redundant given the fully Flash-enabled web browser, but it's not. The application uses the mobile version of YouTube, which means less traffic and perfect playback (unlike the stuttery experience on the desktop YouTube).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the rest, there's the Android Market. Here you can finds a large number of apps (a good portion of them is free by the way) which can be downloaded directly from the handset over Wi-Fi or the mobile network. If you're interested what type of apps the Androird market offers, you can jump over to Cyrket, an unofficial online market catalogue, developed and maintained by Jay Freeman (or saurik) - the same guy that gave iPhone users the unofficial third-party app repository Cydia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch to the regular Android Market on the phone is the warning shown if the application you're about to download has potentially unsafe access to personal data, connectivity settings or else. The warning says exactly what data will be accessed so you can abort the download if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market follows the logic of the pioneering Apple App Store. Everything about it - the structure, the look - is pretty familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding specific apps is pretty easy even now, several months after our first meeting with the Android Market and there are a lot more apps available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty useless (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers and video players).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, there are also games... lots of them. That's quite nice, as the Hero has only one game pre-loaded. It's quite a catch though - the Teeter is loads of fun.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you go back to page one of this review, you'd probably be over and over that long list of disadvantages in disbelief. We did but hell? in HTC Hero we still trust. Really, some of them are big enough like the flawed video playback (which seems more of a software issue to us), the poor video recording (anything lower than VGA@30fps hardly cuts it anymore) and the slow file reindexing. And those are just the lame implementations of features that are already there - just don't get us started on MISSING features. But still the HTC Hero is no unlikely hero in our tale, if you would forgive us the pun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the small gap between Magic's and Hero's unsubsidized prices, the choice between the two is undoubtedly in the Hero's favor - especially since they share most of their disadvantages. The Hero not only sports a shinier and smoother UI but also has a few features the Magic is short of (like tethering enabled by default, multi-touch support and a better still camera). Of course, you can get some of those benefits just by installing a modded Hero ROM on your G1/Dream or Magic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Magic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most formidable adversary that comes to mind is probably the Apple iPhone 3GS. HTC Hero packs an exchangeable battery, microSD slot with microSDHC support, 5-megapixel snapper. The iPhone, on the other hand, offers faster processor, dedicated graphics chip, much better audio, quite richer app store and snappier overall performance. You can check the other differences using our  comparison tool or you can revisit the iPhone 3GS review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 3GS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer to stick to Android, you can also consider Samsung's first Android powered smartphone - the I7500 Galaxy (check out our first take here), which is quite similar to the Hero. However, the Galaxy comes with less RAM and omits features like multi-touch support - porting those from the Hero might be trickier than with the Magic as they come from different manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I7500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another possible rival is HTC's own Touch Diamond2. The latest incarnation of the  TouchFLO 3D UI brings a usability boost to Windows Mobile. Plus, it sure looks more up-to-date. Unfortunately, the flaws of the underlying OS are still there just swept under the rug of the TouchFLO 3D. So even though the Touch Diamond 2 is the most technologically advanced among the competitors on this page, we'd still think twice before going for Windows Mobile - at least not before 6.5 comes out and we take it out for a spin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If those 500 euro they're charging for the Hero are a little too much for you, but you're keen to have a touchscreen smartphone, you might as well look at the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic or its more affordable variety Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. Before you drop the cash however make sure you go through our 5800 XpressMusic review as many of its issues are still unsolved even after a bunch of firmware updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5530 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As our story draws to an end, we must admit we quite enjoyed walking with the Hero. It may not turn out the ultimate smartphone but things not always go as planned. It's nonetheless the best HTC and Andorid OS have churned out to date. And we don't mean to imply that HTC or Android's best is just not good enough. Rather, if they keep that pace of getting better, we're in for a close and wildly entertaining game.</paragraph>
