			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This QWERTY messenger is compact and to the point, with clean and grown up design. The Curve 9360 is sure it can deliver, its confidence unshaken by unknowns and uncertainties. RIM must've enjoyed the safety and comfort of doing what they're best at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Bold flagship and the next Torch generation did the Curve 9360 a favor by taking the pressure of high expectations off it. All it needs to do is focus on the important stuff: giving business users and heavy texters the quality service they deserve. And by the way, it should be the best Curve experience they ever had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher-res screen, robust processor and the new BlackBerry OS 7.0 with NFC support propel the 9360 into an entirely different dimension. Well out of reach for the Curve as we knew it - stuck at QVGA screens and 2 or 3 MP cameras. In fact, it's an option that Bold 9700 and 9780 users would do well to consider. Blasphemy - upgrading from a Bold to a Curve! Well, no more. Just take a closer look at the specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Bold stepping across into touchscreen, the Curve has new found space for growth. And the popular line of BlackBerries didn't hesitate to seize the opportunity. The Curve 9360 is a robust upgrade of its predecessor and a huge step forward for the entire lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Respectful of rank and tradition, but not constrained by them, the new Curve 9360 is unafraid to push into new territories. And it doesn't need to push too hard to impress a new crowd. There will be plenty of returning customers to attend to. The Curve 9360 does well to make them feel at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is in small part due to the design and feel of the handset, which we're about to explore. Interested? See you right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing surprising - or disappointing - about the contents of the BlackBerry Curve 9360 retail package. You get a microUSB data cable, a charger and a single-piece set of earphones. There's also a 4GB microSD memory card (inserted in your phone) and the usual bunch of papers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Curve 9360 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 stands at 109 x 60 x 11 mm and weighs 99 grams - almost the same size and weight as the previous two Curve phones, the 9300 and 8520. Well, it's been a while. It's either that or the new Curve is darn good. The phone is pleasingly compact and friendly. A tidy package that means business. Just the way we like it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Simple, efficient and to the point, and it seems to come naturally for the BlackBerry Curve 9360. Yes, you can tell it's a Curve - the beads of the QWERTY keyboard are a telltale sign. But a phone this slim could've easily been a Bold too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an all-plastic handset but the build is solid. Simple and to the point, the Curve 9360 looks the business messenger part. The only thing we disliked is the glossy battery cover that gest greasy in no time - so much so that the whole thing feels slippery in the hand. A bit of rubbery finish and the Curve 9360 could've one of the most comfortable phones to hold. The phone is sized and shaped for excellent palm fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top half of the front is taken by the 2.46" HVGA+ display (480x360). This is one of the big upgrades in the Curve lineup - a step up from QVGA. The Curve 9360 has a pleasantly crisp screen with vivid colors, nice contrast and viewing angles, and very good sunlight legibility. You can check out its brightness performance in the table below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our dedicated brightness test showed that the Curve 9360 screen is really bright. Its blacks, on the other hand, aren't the deepest we have seen, but they are okay for the LCD league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is what you usually get in the Curve lineup. It's four rows of spaced out buttons, each popping out of its own nest, as opposed to the delicately sculpted keys of the Bolds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard on the Curve 9360 looks a bit cheap and certainly lacks the soft precision and tactility of the Bold 9900's keyboard. But it does the job. The tactility and keypress are decent. There is sufficient spacing between the different rows and columns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a four-row keypad the numbers had to be accommodated over some of the letters - the numpad is on the left. You will also have to use a two-key combo for all the punctuation. Wherever the context allows it, the switch between numbers and letters is automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial. There is a dedicated currency symbol key - its other job is to switch between the loudspeaker and the earpiece (in the music player too). In the music player you can skip tracks back and forth by pressing P or N (previous/next). There're the usual command shortcuts too: * locks the keypad and screen, while # toggles Silent mode on/off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical trackpad sits between the display and the keyboard of the BlackBerry Curve 9360. The typical Menu and Back keys and the two call buttons are placed around it. They're not actual buttons, rather a single piece of screen bezel that can be pressed at different points. It's a neat layout but the downside is the controls are quite hard to press, much in contrast to the soft and responsive trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece and the status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Curve 9360 features the microUSB port for charging and sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right are the thin rubbery convenience key and volume rocker. By default the convenience key is set to launch the camera and serve as a shutter key. Portrait is the default orientation for taking pictures with the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900, and a shutter key placed low on the side makes little sense. It's a fixed focus camera too, so the trackpad will do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small dedicated pause/mute button is placed between the volume Up and Down keys. In the music player, you skip tracks by a long press of the volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the Lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything interesting at the bottom, the microphone pinhole being the only notable presence there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the BlackBerry Curve 9360 features the 5 megapixel camera lens accompanied by the single LED flash. The lens is well recessed so you cannot scratch it unless you try really hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is at the far bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery. The back cover of the Curve 9360 is a rather thin piece of plastic. It comes off easily if you manage to place a fingernail in a tiny, tiny dent at the side of the phone. The battery underneath would easily give us up to two days of medium to heavy use, constantly connected to 3G and - most of the time - our WLAN network. This is about as much as we had with Bold 9900, which has a bigger 1230 mAh battery, but also a higher-res VGA screen and a more powerful processor. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9360 is a nice phone to look at and handle. When it's not covered in smudges, that is. Not only is it an aesthetic thing, finger grease makes the glossy rear dangerously slippery. Other than that though, the phone is a looker. One that even the Bold series wouldn't be ashamed to call their own. It has a solid build despite the all-plastic construction and very good ergonomics. The stiff controls around the trackpad are among the few things to warn against. The screen is a great improvement over the previous Curve generations, the keyboard is solid. The phone is impressively slim and business-like. Maybe a couple of extra paintjobs would be a nice thing to show to young texters, who are typically a Curve target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now join us on the next page as we check out the software package of the Curve 9360.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7 relies on the trackpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Number 7 is the last upgrade of the OS before the switch to BBX. The OS 7 brings very few new features (NFC is well worth a mention though) and focus should be on the user experience instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new platform is based on a better processor and more potent graphics hardware, and it?s exactly the higher system requirements that won?t allow older BlackBerry phones to run the new OS 7. The Curve 9360 runs on a less-capable 800MHz processor than the new Bold 9900 and the Torch 9860, but it is enough to handle the newest OS glitch-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the other OS 7-based BlackBerries, the Curve 9360 doesn?t have a touchscreen and relies on the traditional trackpad navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 is trying to look like the QNX-based Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - changes to the functionality are kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has quick toggles for the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It gives you quick access too to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7 is voice search enabled, too. Clicking on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it. By the way, on the homescreen you can initiate a search by just typing something on the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. The first one holds all icons. For convenience, you can sort some of your apps to the Favorite tab. The most frequently used apps are auto generated in yet another tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Media and Download (for the apps you have downloaded yourself) sections for even more ways of sorting your apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Curve 9360 has a menu button, so usually there are options that are not visible on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the less-powerful processor, the OS 7 ticking inside the Curve 9360 is fast and responsive. We experienced no lags and freezes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 may run a new edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities to get displayed when checking out their details. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Curve 9360 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has both voice and smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Curve 9360 is the usual solid performer. No voice quality drops or reception issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives the Curve 9360 some extra points however is the Smart dial feature. Indeed that was our preferred way of locating contacts on the handset - you just press a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggested names is promptly returned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then select them with the trackpad to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 scored an Average mark in our traditional loudspeaker test, but despite the lower mark the phone sounds really loud so so you should have probably no concerns about missed calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A BIS plan is your only way through the messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 handles has all kinds of messages. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Curve 9360. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not every carrier worldwide is offering BIS, which reduces the Curve 9360 reach. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its name over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with a convenient QWERTY keyboard, the Curve 9360 is great at its main job ? texting. Some visual improvements would've been welcome, but getting the job done is what really matters here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player has no changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>RIM have surely refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s basically all they did. The styling is still pretty conservative, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick search of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Custom playlists are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, what's missing is an indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 performance in our audio quality test is best described as just below average. The smartphone isn't among the loudest we have seen, nor has it got the cleanest output, but it's not terrible either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to the line-out (i.e. the active external amplifier) the Curve 9360 did quite decently. Its signal-to-noise, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk reading were really good and the frequency response was quite good for the most part. Intermodulation distortion was a quite a bit higher than average for that scenario, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when you plug in a pair of headphones quite serious issues arise. The stereo crosstalk goes to levels we have rarely seen before and even more distortion creeps in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With so many better options out there, the Curve 9360 is an easy one to overlook if video-watching is a priority. It would be a mistake. The Curve 9360 does a really great job, so you might want to tick that box on your wish list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape screen is a good start, while the video player itself isn?t bad either. Its styling might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen, along with a dedicated fit/zoom to screen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9360 video player is said to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but the XviD videos didn?t go that easy. Some of the files were OK, while others where just incompatible. It seems it's a bit rate or audio thing, but we won't count on that XviD support much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry customers will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery copy-pasted from OS 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid mode or viewed as a standard list. There?s search by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our image files, so we won?t count that as an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can only be browsed in landscape mode or you can manually rotate them. Unfortunately the Curve 9360 has no built-in accelerometer to provide automatic rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery ? you just flick your finger over the trackpad and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Checking an image?s properties, applying zoom, as well as starting a slide show, are all a menu key click away. Setting one of your images as a homescreen wallpaper is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are zooming and panning. It would have been nice to use the volume rocker as a zoom lever, but the gallery is generally pretty good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 comes with a 5 megapixel camera which is, still the highest resolution you can get from a RIM smartphone. To make it worse, it's a fixed-focus unit so close-range shots (like say documents) are hardly its element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. What?s even worse is that the bar at the bottom covers a part of the frame, making proper framing a really hard task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also pretty uncomfortable, considering that you do most of your shooting with the Curve 9360 in portrait mode. Still you can always use the trackpad to take a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Curve 9360. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Curve 9360 is a mixed bag. The contrast is OK, but the combination of low detail and high levels of noise pretty much ruins the pictures. They will surely do for your Facebook wall, but that's all they are usable for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Curve 9360 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see the Curve 9360 does surprisingly well in studio environment rather than in the live shots. All the charts quality is above average with good amount of detail and the noise levels are kept low enough. Still this won?t do you much good in reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   BlackBerry Curve 9360 in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 records VGA videos at 30 fps and the camcorder's user interface is pretty much similar as the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is pretty high ? the frame rate is good, the resolved detail is adequate, the noise levels tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. We really can?t find anything wrong with the videos, something we didn't quite expect after the disappointing still shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a VGA video sample from the Curve 9360 camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect in a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the tri-band 3G with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2.0 Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The Wi-Fi b/g/n support is another nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also available. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9360 is NFC capable too. You can pair it with other NFC-enabled devices and NFC accessories as well as read NFC tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser, but on small screen and no Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Curve 9360 is one of the best we have seen lately. Despite the smallish display, the browser still does an excellent job and will serve you well. It is fast, responsive, supports text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing missing is Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start using the trackpad, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple tabs are supported and switching between them is pretty easy - just click on the tabs key at the top right corner. Page rendering is near perfect, displaying almost every page like on a desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow works like a charm, working everytime you zoom in or out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the missing Flash support, the handset provides probably one of the best user experience in browsing the web despite its smallish display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business ethic, the Curve 9360 has superb time-management capabilities. Its organizer includes a decent set of applications and although some of them are hardly lookers, their usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and lets you easily set up customized events. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but sadly the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the alarm tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9360 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the standard functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Curve 9360 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World is where all the app are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal. Some you can get for free of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage your apps on a computer or directly on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest releases. In general there's hardly anything to complain about in terms of interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, and to make it worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps works only with a BIS plan<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Curve 9360 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated to include more cities. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comfortably compact and impressively slim, the BlackBerry Curve 9360 looks good and works hard to meet your needs. The newly-found skill makes it the definitive upgrade for anyone coming from a previous generation of the Curves. Even Bold 9700 and 9780 owners, who are trying to steer clear of touchscreen, can give it a thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QVGA screens and low-spec'd cameras are a thing of the past. The lineup has moved on with confidence and style - the 9360 is the best Curve experience to date. Take out the VGA touchscreen and the 1.2GHz processor (oops, HD video goes with it!) and it can nearly match the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9360 is lucky too not having to deal with as much pressure as the flagship Bold 9900. It won't be too hard for the Curve 9360 to keep upgraders happy. There're plenty of old Curves, Pearls and even old enough Bolds whose owners will be happy to get the latest OS version in a good-looking and well featured package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition doesn't seem to be at its fiercest either. Android messengers and Eseries touch phones are likely to do more damage to the Bold and the Torch. There's an extra line of defense too in the Curve 9380. The touchscreen alter ego of the Curve 9360 is basically the same phone inside - for both hardware and software. The 3.2" HVGA+ touchscreen just costs a few euros more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Curve 9380</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the droids, they can successfully compete with the Curve 9360 for the young social texters, not so much for the hard-core business user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro, which we recently reviewed, has a LED-backlit Reality display with Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine, an 8 megapixel ExmorR camera sensor, 720p video with continuous autofocus, and the latest Android 2.3.4. It costs about the same as the Curve 9360.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Arguably, the just released Motorola PRO+ matches the business messenger profile somewhat better. It runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread and packs a 1GHz processor, a VGA touchscreen, a 5 megapixel camera with HD video recording.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy M Pro B7800 even throws in an optical trackpad to mimic the BlackBerry experience. With a 1GHz processor and the latest Android, it doesn?t seem underpowered at all. It's quite slim too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>None of these otherwise fine smartphones though seems to directly threaten the Curve 9360. It's not just the form factor or the lack of touchscreen. It's the years of BlackBerry experience that many users will find hard to put behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RIM may not be the standard-setter in touchscreen, they're less than stellar in tablets and obviously suck at saying sorry. But they don't have to prove anything to anyone when it comes to messengers. The Curve may pale in comparison to the massive effort invested into developing a whole new touchscreen lineup and the BBX platform. But the BlackBerry Curve 9360 is not a step back. It's RIM back at what they do best.</paragraph>
