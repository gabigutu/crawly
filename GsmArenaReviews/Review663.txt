			<paragraph>Lenovo's MWC stand is drawing quite a lot of attention, and rightfully so. The company has a large portfolio of devices on display, spanning the entire range of smart gadgets from phones, to tablets, to wearables, and then some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arguably the centerpiece of the lineup is the photography-centric Lenovo Vibe Shot smartphone. It packs a 16MP camera with a multitude of features in both hardware and software. The phone is made of high-quality materials and doesn't compromise in terms of specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then proceed to meet the Lenovo A7000, which joins the highly successful A6000 model in the midrange, but carries improvements in screen size, memory and processor department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A range of tablets are also on display, with a large 10-inch FullHD slab stealing the show. Two smaller 8-inch units provide more compact solutions in either Android or Windows flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo pulled a joker out of its sleeve though, and that's the Pocket Projector. Striking adequate compromise between size and features, the small device offers a large screen experience on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spent a few minutes with each of the above and we'll share our findings on the following pages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe Shot hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Shot is the most exciting smartphone the company has brought to Barcelona. We were teased with leaks suggesting exclusive features and premium build in the weeks leading up to MWC and we were eager to get to play with it in person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is targeted at photography enthusiasts and doesn't hide it. It packs a 16MP main camera with triple-LED flash, optical image stabilization, and manual controls. Design throwbacks from rangefinders of old can also be spotted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot comes with a 64-bit Snapdragon 615 chipset with 1.7GHz octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, so performance is a non-issue. On the front you are greeted by a 5-inch display of FulHD resolution, utilizing an IPS panel. The smartphone boots Lollipop out of the box, with the company's home-brewed Vibe UI on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display produces punchy colors and is sharp and bright when viewed head-on. On the downside, the screen is very reflective which impacts viewing angles in a negative way. The coating is also rather prone to smudging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is very good, but has its flaws. For starters, the outer frame is finely-machined, feels great in the hand and exudes quality. The metal strip on the back, however, is less impressive in terms of craftsmanship, at least in the demo units. As you can see for yourselves the back is also a fingerprint mess. Overall though, the device is solidly put together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame is home to the dedicated photography controls. A rarity among smartphones of late, the two-stage shutter release button is a welcome sight. Lenovo's implementation may need a bit of tweaking before official launch though, as the button in the demo units was much too stiff and had little travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the shutter release, a settings slider lets you choose between Smart and Pro modes. Smart is your average Auto and offers little control other than flash modes. Pro is what we're here for, and it brings a handy list of settings on the left, including exposure compensation, ISO, white balance and focus modes. No video recording is available with the slider in this position, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Shot sports a 16MP BSI sensor, with a 16:9 native ratio and the images come out at a rather odd 5,328 x 2,997 pixel resolution. If you prefer the more traditional 4:3 aspect ratio, you'll end up with 12MP stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a few samples and they appear to contain plenty of detail. The Vibe Shot also handled with finesse the difficult lighting conditions in the venue in terms of white balance. The triple-LED flash was also spot-on. We'll reserve judgement until we get to review a proper production unit in our studio, but the outlook is promising.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo A7000 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not all about photography and Lenovo brought in a more generic balanced member of the midrange. The A7000 is a 5.5-inch phablet sporting 720p resolution on its IPS panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone packs a Mediatek MT6572 chipset with a 1.5GHz octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM. At has no major omissions on paper and comes with LTE connectivity, expandable 8GB storage and 2,900mAh worth of battery. A current Android 5.0 is on board, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The head-turning feature on the A7000 are the Dolby ATMOS certified audio enhancements which emphasize sounds and offer broader dynamic range, the company claims. We couldn't test it ourselves but got a brief hands-on time with the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made entirely of plastic, but it's the preferable matte variety, so the back doesn't instantly turn into a smudgy mess. The surface is also reasonably grippy and handles well, for a 5.5-inch device, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is obviously not as sharp as the one on the Vibe Shot, but 720p on a 5.5-inch diagonal is still acceptable, given the price segment. It's an IPS unit as well, with all the positive implications including accurate colors and wide viewing angles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Tab 2 A10-70 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo isn't short on tablets here in Barcelona, and we got to play with two Android slates as well as a Windows 8.1 offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top model that the company has brought is the Tab 2 A10-70. Behind all this alphanumeric disguise hides a full-size slate with a 10.1-inch IPS display of 1,920 x 1,200 pixel resolution. The list of innards goes on with a Mediatek chipset with quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet boots Lollipop out of the box and will have an LTE version as well. It's also Dolby ATMOS enabled and has a strip of speakers running along the entire length of the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hands, it's a pretty hefty slab, thanks in no small part to the 7000mAh battery. On the positive side, the display is bright and sharp, and lends itself well to sideways viewing. The glossy coating is very reflective though, and is a fingerprint nightmare.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Tab 2 A8 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving down the lineup, we are greeted by the Lenovo Tab 2 A8. We've learned our lesson, and recognize by now that the 8 denotes screen size. Indeed, the Tab 2 A8 comes with an 8-inch IPS display of 1,280 x 800 pixel resolution for a decent density of 189ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Computing power comes courtesy of a Mediatek chipset again, only a single gig of RAM is on board and storage is either 8GB or 16GB, expandable too. This one runs KitKat, and is available in Wi-Fi only and 4G version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the screen isn't as sharp as the one in the Tab 2 A10-70, the colors are equally great and only fade slightly if examined at an angle. The back of the 8-inch tablet has a similar texture to the one on the 10-inch offering but subjectively the black color looks cheaper and is more revealing of oily finger marks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo MIIX 300 8" hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIIX 300 8" (whether that's mee-x or M-two-X is questionable) runs Windows 8.1 and unsurprisingly features an 8-inch IPS panel of 1,280 x 800 resolution. It will presumably come in a number of different configurations with an Intel Atom chipset, up to 2GB of RAM and up to 64GB of internal storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Pocket Projector<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a slight distraction from the smartphone/tablet theme, we checked out the Lenovo Pocket Projector. The compact device weighs merely 170g and can project an image up to 110 inches in diagonal. The projecting part can be rotated around the other half which acts as a stand. It comes with DLNA and Miracast Wi-Fi connectivity and battery is rated at 2.5 hours, enough for a full-length movie or a PowerPoint presentation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't do miracles at this size though, and the Pocket Projector has its limitations. Resolution is rather low at 854 x 480 pixels and brightness is only 50 lumens, so daytime use is very much out of the question.</paragraph>
