			<paragraph>Out-of-this-world design, head-turning exterior, non-touch Symbian UIQ, excellent multimedia equipment. We're testing a Motorola kick-slider!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the RIZR Z8 Motorola is creatively revisiting the realms of Symbian UIQ. Except for Wi-Fi, the handset offers full data connectivity, perfect display and high-capacity memory card support - all packed in a sexy black slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A high-end multimedia device, the RIZR Z8 offers a few unique features: it's a UIQ 3.1 and yet a non-touchscreen handset, plus the kick-slide form factor is a true show-off. Almost all is staked on multimedia with this phone, so much so that the improvements offered by the enhanced RIZR Z10 model are limited to the imaging: a 3-megapixel camera and xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough has been said about the seductive power of the RAZR's revolutionary design. With a handful of RAZR models already seasoned veterans, Motorola has always been keen to replicate that huge popularity by releasing updated versions and limited editions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tempting looks were later inherited by two other Motorola lines: KRZR and RIZR. Rizr is the label of the handset we're testing - the Moto Z8. The Motorola genes to look out for are the trademark chin and the slider form factor, which is the convention in the RIZR lineup. Along with some of the usual Motorola design and functionality solutions, the Z8 brings exciting multimedia power and the unique slide-and-bend action for high-end targeting of both the style sensitive and the tech-savvy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Slide and bend<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The RIZR Z8 is currently available in black only, but market success will surely bring out alternative color versions. To not let the subdued conservative black smother the dazzling personality of this handset, designers chose to perk it up with a fluorescent green trim, which goes well with the interface background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, most of the surface is matt - the only troublesome areas are the display and the mirror-like coating on the back. This designer solution would be welcome by many. The slick KRZR is a lovely sight but how long will it stay clean? With the Z8, wiping the screen and the back every now and then will keep it as good as new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, RIZR stands for slider in the Motorola language, though with the Z8, sliding has a twist to it and that's not just a punchline. Pioneering a unique form factor, the sliding action in Z8 is coupled with a bend, curving the handset's body inwards. This eccentric design comfortably wraps the handset around your face, but at the same time eats up the headroom for the top row of keys on the alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The peculiar rocker point is a little over halfway up the back part of the slider. The whole area above the break point on the non-sliding part is the battery cover. At the very top, all you have is the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typical Motorola<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the left side there's a threesome of identically sized and shaped buttons. The upper two are the volume keys, beneath them is the dedicated video-call button. The decent stroke and adequate response hardly make up for the almost zero touch orientation. The keys are flush with surface and even you feel your way to them, it's hard to guess which one is which. Below this three-key layout is the microSD card slot protected by a rubber cover. The RIZR Z8 supports cards of up to 4GB capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the right-hand side - right below the bend point - is the dedicated media player key. Another control on this side is the conspicuous green shutter key. It is right above the miniUSB connector port, which is protected by a thin rubber cap of rather questionable durability given the frequent use of the port (charger, data cable, headphones). The side control layout is quite typical Motorola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset sports a mirror-like strip, which comes out as metal but is actually plastic. The initial feeling of exclusivity and luxury vanishes with the very first touch of its soft and squashy surface. The shiny strip is divided in three segments: the upper is part of the battery cover, whereas the lower covers the SIM card holder. Yes, with the Z8 you can switch SIM cards without removing the battery. The middle section is fixed and houses the camera lens and the LED flash, which serves the dual purpose of a camera tally light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location of the camera lens just couldn't have been worse. The most comfortable way of holding the phone to your ear inevitably sticks a finger right onto that lens, which will end up covered in smudges ever too often. Given the form factor it could've been easily placed at the back of the front sliding panel and thus kept safe and clean.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling the phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The solid feel and nice resistance of the sliding mechanism are worth commending. The slider is firm and secure in both open and closed position, no irritating wobbles. The bend hinge is a different story: even with the slider closed it will still fold over, causing a visible rift between the display and the keypad. Other than that, the hinge seems sturdy enough, not too loose or shaky. The question is how it will put up with a few months of intensive usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though frankly driven by looks for the most part, the slide and bend action does have some purpose - it addresses the typical slider disproportion and makes the handset more ergonomic in calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the slider we have the VGA video-call camera, the earpiece and the handsfree microphone. Beneath them is one of the Z8 true goodies: the 2.2" TFT display of 16 million colors and QVGA resolution. Brightness can be adjusted in seven steps and a screensaver is activated upon a set interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the interface appearance by varying the color themes. The RIZR Z8 has two of them, though few are likely to ever prefer the white one over the default black and green combo that goes perfectly well with the phone's exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Readability is excellent in sunlight and, overall, the display is quite successful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display is the round navigation key. There's a threesome of buttons on both of its sides: two soft keys, Home (menu) and Clear key, as well as the Call and End keys. The keys on this flatbed control pad are separated by tiny rubber ridges for better touch orientation. Another rubber strip is placed right above the D-pad serving as a thumb-rest for opening the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the Z8 open reveals the alphanumeric keypad shouldered by the omnipresent Motorola chin, well-known ever since the very first RAZR came to life. Within it a loudspeaker and a small status LED - indicating battery charge - are incorporated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is typical flatbed, though little curved given the kick-slider form factor. It's all a glossy membrane with individual keys separated by rubber ridges, which do provide some touch orientation. The good backlighting does help usability, but overall the keypad does require quite some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper row of keys are not so easy to reach due to the insufficient headroom, the chin stands in the way to the bottom row. The stroke is minimal, which some may like, but tactile feedback could've been better. Both the control and alphanumeric keys are quite rigid and require rather firm presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing on the Z8 does require some practice and you're likely to eventually get the hang of the alphanumeric keypad. The D-pad however was a nightmare. Wrong presses just didn't seem to end; the directions should've been more distinct and less prone to mixing up. On a different note, response to keypresses is commendably fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RIZR Z8 is undoubtedly a style-driven handset and the shiny metal knobs at the bottom corners of the keypad do raise brows. They are the tiny terminals that help the handset determine slider position and placing them out of the user's sight shouldn't have been a great engineering challenge. The tiny hole in the right one, visible upon a closer inspection, is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the handset's got to offer comes in the fairly good dimensions of 50.7 x 109.7 x 15.3 mm, and 112 g weight. For a classic slider these are on the bulkier side, but the Z8 is a Symbian smartphone, which is a good enough excuse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting with the world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z8 is an above average performer in terms of connectivity - GPRS, EDGE and HSDPA - it has it all. The only prominent absence is Wi-Fi. We can't help the feeling that the ignoring of Wi-Fi is an ill turn for Motorola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Short range connectivity is courtesy of Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP and AVRCP (remote control) support. PC connectivity is available through the supplied miniUSB cable, the connection modes available are modem, phone management and Mass Storage with the memory card inserted. In this mode speed varies from 750 KB/s for writing to 830 KB/s for reading. A card reader seems the better option for putting stuff on your memory card as the read/write speeds are way faster. The battery can be charged off the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB charging is hassle free however bear in mind that the Motorola Z8 is incompatible with some miniUSB chargers. A closer inspection of the supplied charger revealed that its output is lower - 850 mA instead of 1 A. In case you have a charger of the second type at hand, be warned that it's not to be used with your Z8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Houston, we have a problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The RIZR Z8 is powered by a 330 MHz processor and makes use of 50 MB RAM. The user available storage memory is 80 MB, expandable via the microSD slot. System speed is relatively good and users are up against a stable, problem-free operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the shortcomings of Z8 are not much of a burden and we can even live with the lack of WLAN support. The worst news is still to come though. Motorola RIZR Z8 is based on Symbian 9.2 UIQ 3.1, for which there are not as many applications available in the first place, as for - say - Symbian S60.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That wouldn't have been such a drawback, had it been possible to get most of the existing applications running off UIQ. Quite a few attempts at installing third-party UIQ software went up in smoke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we eventually made it - and even got the thingy going - it was another disaster. The Z8 doesn't have touchscreen support and the control pad is your only option for working with the application interface. It's kinda irritating to look at icons on the screen and not being able to use them, plus some functions - even essential and irreplaceable ones - are not accessible by way of the control and navigation keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't wish to make it appear worse than it actually is and in day-to-day use things may not be that hopelessly dismal. But what we have is proclaimed simplicity, which all of a sudden faces potential users with a handful of challenges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile forums on the Internet will sure be a vital resource for Z8 owners but some challenges won't be properly addressed unless a firmware update is available to alleviate the situation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a nine icon grid or a list, with all items freely rearrangeable. Filling the contact list is quite straightforward upon a PC connection. The way contacts display can be set by first and last name, or company. When adding a new entry you don't have to go through all the available fields (more than 50 of them). You can use the few basic ones and add more according to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing messages, a number of editing options are available (copy, remove, insert). The iTap editor is at hand of course, which can also be turned off. We do like it better than T9, for its superior user-friendliness and handling of new vocabulary entries. Keypress response is great when typing, once you master the alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the email department support for POP3, IMAP and SMTP is available. Downloading headers only or entire messages is user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the usual threefold combination of calendar views and several events to set (Appointment, Reminder, All day event and Anniversary), the calendar offers a setting for the home-screen indication, item size, snooze and advanced notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All these settings are available when saving a new calendar entry, along with the default fields the manufacturer deemed most frequently used. There are 5 ringing profiles, new ones can be added too and a Kill Filter can be applied to block calls and text from user defined numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time application displays local and world time, and offers three alarm slots. Tasks, notes and a calculator are available in Z8 too, along with a File Manager and a voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you're used to working with Office documents, PDF or ZIP files on the go, you'll need to install additional software on your Z8. We tested adding the "Documents To Go" application and it worked, though far from flawlessly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bored? No, thanks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z8 has a main 2 megapixel camera and a secondary VGA unit for video calls, which can also be used for taking pictures. The maximum image resolution available is 1600x1200 pixels. To take pictures with the primary camera, the slider has to be closed. Sliding the handset open activates the secondary VGA unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of operating the camera is quite straightforward, but it would've been way better to have the main unit operable with the slider open and the keypad available for quick access to the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When taking pictures with the main camera, the interface is in landscape mode, with the soft keys used for choosing the desired settings. The left soft key is used for entering the settings menu, which will disappear upon confirmation leaving a number of status indicators at the bottom of the viewfinder (showing storage, picture size and quality, camera mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated camera key or the center of the navigation key serves as the capture button. The four ways of the navigation key are also assigned specific functions: Up will save the shot and open the Gallery, Down saves and launches the MMS editor to send the picture, Left saves and returns to viewfinder, while Right will discard the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z8 camera offers the usual set of features: four color effects, self timer, several white balance presets, adjustable shutter sound, picture size and picture quality settings. Video is recorded in 3GP format at a maximum QVGA resolution. There are three video size options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to be desired of the pictures taken with Z8. Color saturation is generally low, and the pictures are somewhat dark. The edge-to-edge sharpness is also uneven but that is normal for a mid-tier phone camera. Of course, since there is no auto focus, shooting close-ups is impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Staying on multimedia, the music player supports the AMR NB, XMF, MP3, AAC, AAC+, AAC Enhanced and MIDI formats. MP3 are played with variable bitrate, though handling files of higher than 320 kbps is problematic. The music content is automatically arranged in the library, tracks are sorted by artist, album and composer. The player can be minimized to run in the background and controlled with the volume rocker, the D-pad and the dedicated player key, which functions as play/pause. The now running track is displayed on the home screen, including running time indication.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on the loudspeaker, the standard wired headset or on Bluetooth headphones. The supplied wired headset is connected through the miniUSB port and works without problem. Only the microphone could've been a bit smaller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Storing multimedia content follows a logical and easy to observe file structure. Audio files, videos and images are easy to access and comfortably at hand in the media gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With watching videos it is a totally different story. You'll have to install a bunch of codecs, or even a brand new third party player, to enjoy your favorite clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled MobiClip is there mostly for the Bourne Identity movie, which comes on the supplied 512 MB memory card. Once you've watched that one, the video player is pretty much doomed to oblivion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Java support makes sure additional applications can further expand the functionality of your Z8. Having installed the downloaded application in Control Panel, it is available in the menu along with all the rest of the applications or games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RIZR Z8 comes with the Asphalt 2 game preinstalled. The system expandability is unlimited, provided you're lucky to get some of the titles you like running on the non-touch UIQ 3.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z8 is based on some great novelties, but the implementation of the concepts is far from perfect. The choice of platform is most questionable when it comes to compatibility with third-party applications. Maybe the good old Windows Mobile or even Symbian S60 could've been the more straightforward choice. Though on a second thought, Motorola are deliberately evading positioning the Z8 as a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is more than obvious that the RIZR Z8 is fit enough to cater to the taste of the style minded, but on the other hand it could get easily buried in the multimedia niche.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, the Z8 deserves credit in quite a number of aspects. The splendid display is the most obvious starting point, the high-end data capability follows suit. The high-capacity memory card support and the stereo Bluetooth give it enviable music player abilities. Let's not forget the brand new interface, which healthily departs from the old Motorola looks and questionable user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two things are unique about the Z8 - the kick-slide form factor and the non-touch UIQ platform. A smartphone of the least conservative looks, the RIZR Z8 is easily a class-in-its-own niche product. And then, pressure on it is coming from all ends - non-smart feature-packed handsets and smartphones alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expect to see even more UIQ smartphone products by Motorola in the near future having in mind the recent acquisition of half of UIQ from Sony Ericsson. So the MotoRIZR Z8 might as well turn out a proof-of-concept platform that is yet to see development.</paragraph>
