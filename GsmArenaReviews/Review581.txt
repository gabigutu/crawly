			<subsectionTitle>Introduction:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic is putting on its boots, pulling on its anorak, slinging its rucksack over its shoulder and striding out into the unfriendliest of environments: water, dust, tough ground?you name it, this device promises to shrug it off and keep on going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After countless Nseries, Eseries, XpressMusic and classic releases and facelifts, Nokia look keen to revisit an almost forgotten niche of users - those who need a tough phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the Finns have finally put that right and they seem to have a promising candidate on their hands for those who care less about features and even less about the weather. So, if you're after a handset that can survive the elements, get ready to check out the rugged Nokia 3720.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a part of the Nokia classic series, the 3720 has a stylish oval design, nice handling, S40 user interface, decent display, FM radio and a 2 megapixel camera. But that's not all. As a ruggedized device, the Nokia 3720 classic has been designed to resist water, dust and to survive some pretty extreme situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a list of what the Nokia 3720 classic can do for you and another one of the things that just didn't fit in that sort of tough body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well here we are, holding the rugged Nokia 3720 classic in our hands and just itching to submerge it in water or run over it with a car. It's not too often that we get the chance to play with devices from this specialized sector of the mobile market, so we hope you'll share our enthusiasm as we put it through a battery of tests.But we'll come to that eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, let's not waste any more time and get straight to it with the design and ergonomics after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>No USB cable in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Nokia 3720 classic is standard issue stuff. Along with the handset itself, inside you will find the battery and 1GB microSD card. Yes, well spotted, there is no USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you also get a charger and a 2.5 mm handsfree, which unfortunately is one-piece. Finally, there's the usual load of paperwork.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3720 classic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic measures 115 x 47 x 15.3 mm with a volume of 69 cc. The phone hits the sweetspot of comfortable handling. Neither too small, nor too big, it would fit nicely into any pocket. Don't let the weight of 94 g fool you, the 3720 classic has a pleasingly solid feel in the hand, and the body seems quite sturdy and reliable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a device fashioned to survive in tough environments, the Nokia 3720 classic looks really mainstream. It doesn't quite have the rough, almost intimidating, appearance of a Samsung B2700 - or the Nokia 5140 for that matter. We're not saying it's less fit for outdoor action - it just looks more work-and-play than hike-and-bike. We do have our doubts about the silver front frame - a bit of hardened rubber would've been more like it in this segment, but we quite like it the way it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the rugged picture though, there is a strong rubber cushion between the metal lining and the rear panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the 3720 classic is among the finest we've seen by Nokia in terms of both contrast and color rendering, and it has an impressively wide viewing angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QVGA screen can display up to 16M colors on a 2.2" diagonal. Sunlight legibility is an absolute treat even if the colors get washed out a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display, the two sides of the D-pad accommodate the soft keys and the Call and End buttons. The navigation frame of the D-pad projects nicely over a roomy confirm key. All controls are comfortable to use and occasional mispresses are very rare. Typical for a ruggedized device, the keys are stiff and have quite a low stroke but that's the price to pay for splash resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is made of robust plastic and the spaces in-between are filled with isolating rubber. The D-pad has metal finish, which improves both looks and sturdiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star and hash key are smaller and slightly less comfortable but that seems to be a sacrifice to the curvy styling of the device. Otherwise, the keys are big enough and well defined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a small flashlight on the Star key, which allows you to start the flashlight feature of the camera LED flash by a longer press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display backlighting and the white keypad illumination are quite strong and even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and left sides of the Nokia 3720 classic completely blank, as Nokia decided to cram everything into the bottom this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the 3720 is where all the connectivity ports are - microUSB, a 2.5mm audio jack, and the charger plug port - all hidden under a plastic cap. The lanyard eyelet is also at the bottom as well. This means that if you want to listen to music, you have to keep the cap off. It's only the charger port that is not completely closed, but Nokia have that quite waterproof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset doesn't have much to show either - the only thing there is the rubber volume rocker. What's more interesting is that the volume keys are part of the rubber frame surrounding the whole phone and dividing the front from the rear panel. We suppose its purpose is better insulation. It can even soften some falls as it slightly protrudes from the rest of the body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our round trip of the 3720 classic with the rear. The extremely well secured battery cover is locked with a metal screw. As you might imagine, the battery cover is made of robust plastic with a rubber sealing. The matt plastic used is quite nice actually and is totally fingerprint-proof, however it didn't survive our car run over without damages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the 2-megapixel camera lens there is a LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. We assumed that the loudspeaker beneath the grill is water-tight alright, but during our water and? here's a spoiler coming? beer dip test, it was the first thing to start breaking down eventually dying in us upon a throw on the asphalt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens has metal edging and is slightly recessed into the surface to avoid scratches, but surprisingly for a ruggedized phone, there's no lens cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover is very easy, but you need to use a small coin to turn the screw. A half turn around the clock is enough to unlock and open it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover reveals the Nokia Li-Ion BL-5CT 1050 mAh battery. The SIM and microSD slots can be found under the battery. Nokia quote an expected battery life of up to 408h of standby or 7h of calls. In real life, the battery lasted some good 4 days of moderate usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic is extremely handy and pocket friendly. It has no glossy plastics so there is no chance of it slipping out of your fingers, and it has the added bonus of not attracting fingerprints.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tough S40 for a tough Nokia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic employs the Series 40 6th edition user interface. The UI is well familiar and the 6th edition novelties will hardly surprise you if you have been keeping track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available much like on its smart S60-based peers. The active standby adds new functionality to the homescreen - more that you would generally have on a feature phone by another brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fields on this special homescreen consist of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for some shortcuts that give you instant access to favorite applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second section displays today's events from the calendar. At the very bottom events from the calendar are displayed for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic main menu can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical for the S40 UI 6th edition, the icons themselves have been changed to match the current styling of Nokia Symbian smartphones and the 3D animation has been dropped. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic comes with five preinstalled themes. All of them fit the ethos of the handset with their conservative styling. There are of course many additional themes available for download online. There are even some that produce sounds on certain events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720c menu seems to respond quickly, without any lags or holdups. This is the case with basically any S40 device nowadays and we wouldn't expect any less from the Classic series device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Easy phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 3720 classic offers space for up to 2000 contacts and extensive configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. Also, first names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing. Contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters. Another praiseworthy application is the voice dial, which requires no pre-recording of the commands and phonebook names. It is even equipped with a training application that helps get better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and call quality are in line with the Nokia 3720 classic's high standards. Calls are loud and clear on both ends eliminating any possible obstacles to communication. After all a handset like the 3720 classic is mainly intended to be used for making calls even in unfriendly environment and conditions so any compromise in this area would be a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 3720 classic ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It certainly doesn't have the loudest speaker around but it's not all too bad either. You can find more info about the test itself, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Message menu of Nokia 3720 classic is almost perfectly organized. The handset is capable of handling practically any type of message - SMS, EMS, MMS and e-mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three types share an editor and all you need to convert an SMS to an EMS or MMS is to apply text formatting or insert any multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the messaging editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really good stuff. It automatically adjusts its settings once you enter your email address and then all you need to do is enter your username and password. No more time wasted on trying to get a long list of settings right for the client to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in Nokia 3720 classic is identical to those found in the others Series 40 devices. Looks have improved over the 5th edition devices but featurewise it remains unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available track sorting filters is include artist, album and genre and there is support for Album art. The supported A2DP profile allows you to listen through Bluetooth wireless earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience of the player is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. Nokia 3720 classic has only one loudspeaker located on the side, right next to the camera. We already mentioned that we weren't terribly impressed by its loudness and ruggedness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic also has stereo FM radio with RDS on board and traditionally uses the headset for an antenna. That again means the protective cap at the bottom of the phone should be off, while you're tuning in to a station thus compromising protection of all ports.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After a series of excellent devices in terms of audio quality that Nokia threw our way, the 3720 classic comes as a bit of a disappointment. It's not that the handset is that terrible or having some deal-breaker issues, but its performance is just average and we were expecting better given the Finnish company recent record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the Nokia 3720 classic audio output is its frequency response, which is almost flawless, which is pretty close to the perfect throughout the audible range. The total harmonic distortion is also excellent, while the intermodulation distortion is also pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the noise level and dynamic range readings are unimpressive, and so is the stereo crosstalk. We have seen worse of course, but just a look at any of the other recently reviewed Nokia handset will tell you that the 3720 classic is a step backwards. We are just hoping it's a sacrifice that had to be made in favor of the improved durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can check out the Nokia 3720 classic performance in comparison to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We personally aren't great fans of the Series 40 gallery. The fact that it also acts as a file manager somewhat hurts its user-friendliness and looks. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your photo files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery also relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, for the type of segment the Nokia 3720 classic occupies, the gallery seems ok. The sad thing though is that even more expensive S40 phones offer no improvement in that department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S40 video player as you may be familiar plays only 3gp and mp4 videos and works fine for watching either video recorded on the phone itself or some other small clips.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A 2 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3720 classic is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera. Typical for Series 40, the camera settings are limited, but that makes them simpler and easier to use. The settings include white balance and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a LED flash on the device, which should in theory make the photos in low light conditions somewhat usable, but of course it doesn't go a long way in practice. Anyway, we suppose the main utilization of the LED will be as a flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, the Nokia 3720c photo quality is decent enough for the 2 megapixel class. The colors are nice, the resolved detail is satisfying. The noise levels are high at some places, but we can't expect much from this camera anyway. Just look at the sky in the samples below and you will get the idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording is rather modest - QCIF@15fps, but we didn't expect much either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one disappointment about the camera which is not directly related to picture quality - the absence of a lens cover. Despite playing it all tough and rugged, the Nokia 3720 classic camera fails to deliver adequate protection for the lens and only relies on a slight recession into the surface to avoid scratches or damage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini 4.2 onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like all recent S40 6th edition devices, the Nokia 3720 classic comes with an integrated WebKit-based HTML web browser and guess what? Apple's Safari and Mobile Safari are based on WebKit, as well as the browser for the Android platform and the Palm Pre. The browser in the 3720 classic shares code with some of the best out there and doesn't disappoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now before you ask, inline Flash content (including video) is not supported - there's some rudimentary support but it's just enough to display certain banners, not play YouTube videos. For YouTube playback you'll need to use the mobile version of the website. Then again, we guess the Nokia 3720c is not your dream portable YouTube player and you know that from the very start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lack of landscape mode and Google (or any other engine for that matter) search is another downer of the proprietary web browser. A flaw that sticks out like a sore thumb is the font rendering - it's very rough and zooming out at even 75% makes the text almost unreadable, and at 50% even headings become very mangled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini still comes preinstalled - a tradition on S40 phones. And it has its place, despite the big improvements in the built-in browser. The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into a lighter format to the device, with the images compressed. While this somewhat spoils the quality, on a small screen (as most low-power devices that rely on the Mini have) you can't tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in image quality aside, the compression really saves on data charges. For example, GSMArena.com clocked in at about 370KB through the built-in browser and just about 70KB through Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both applications are preloaded and you can choose the one that suits you best.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 3720 classic has undergone very few changes compared to the other S40 models. Not that it needs many, as it handles time-management almost perfectly. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are also five types of events available that can be set up: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A To-do manager, alarm clock, voice recorder, countdown timer and stopwatch are also onboard. The usual calculator, unit converter and search applications are not forgotten either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also on board, but since there is no GPS receiver, its practicality stretches only to provide an electronic map, but we guess even that is not bad to have on a regular feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, holding down the Star key turns the flashlight on and off. We could not find any software shortcut, but nothing beats having a hardware shortcut for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games to kill a bit of time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are four preinstalled games on the Nokia 3720 classic - Block'd, Bounce Tales, Brain Champ and Sudoku. While the last three are very familiar and we've seen them on almost every Nokia nowadays, Block'd is a new one to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's has very simple gameplay - group similarly colored blocks destroys them. Your goal is to clear the screen of all the blocks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3720 classic stress tests<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright then, it's about time we got real busy with the 3720 classic. There may be no news in that basic S40 package but the toughness tests will hopefully show its true worth. The Nokia 3720 classic is IP54 certified for dust and water-splash resistance. By the way, Nokia official promos included shock tests too. Well, so did we.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't even bother leave the office for the first tests - other than to get some beer. The truth is, the 3720 classic doesn't hold its liquor but hey, that's actually a compliment for a rugged phone. We drowned the phone in a plastic beer mug. Then we put it under running water. At the end of both tests we had a perfectly working phone with only one temporary issue - the raspy loudspeaker. Anyway, in about ten minutes the phone restored its original sound. The 3720 classic wasn't bothered by the liquid treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next on our schedule was running the 3720 classic over with a car. Having done that to the Samsung B2700, we were quite eager to see how the rugged Finn handles more than a ton and a half of weight. Apart from getting quite dirty and scratched on both ends of the rear panel, the Nokia 3720 classic showed no other evidence of damage. The front panel was absolutely intact, the protective lens glass had no scratches or any sort of damage. Considering that most of the phone's body is made of plastic it held up absolutely fine after the hit and run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset looked quite ready for another round of torture actually, so we went on and kicked it around, slammed it against a concrete wall, buried it in mud and dust, threw it 4 meters up in the air and let it hit the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first series of kicking and slamming caused no visible harm. The second time though, which we recorded on video, inflicted some minor scratches at the bottom side and the front and rear panels were slightly ajar on the left side of the phone. That was easily fixable though with a gentle press on that particular spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mud and dust, as you may have guessed, were taken with a grin. Our final shock test is a different story though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two attempts we did led to another detachment of the panels, which was again easily fixable. The metal frame was bent a bit around the plastic lid that covers the connectors at the bottom - it now can't be completely closed. This might lead to future problems with splash resistance we fear. The major issue however was the loudspeaker, which stopped working. Other than that, the phone is fully functional and its front still looks like new. Go ahead, take a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day, the 3720 classic did a great job. Water, mud and dust are no issue for the rugged Finn and that's its main purpose to begin with. The 3720 also is tough enough to withstand quite a bit of hitting and accidental drops. Maybe it is not as tough as the Sonim XP1, but it will sure survive most common accidents. Just be careful not to drop it from too high, the loudspeaker is its Achilles' heel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess those promo videos by Nokia you may have seen are trustful, but we doubt they've done all that kicking, bashing, dropping and dipping all to a single phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3720 classic is a phone you can easily miss in the crowd of basic S40 handsets. But we guess that somehow works in its favor. The combination of classic looks and excellent durability make it a great choice for a larger sample of users. The 3720 classic makes sense as both an urban and an outdoor device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no doubt that the standard S40 package works perfectly well as a low-end solution for the value-for-money customers. Dust and water resistance, along with proven sturdiness and solid build are an added gain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we have here is a handset that can stand a lot of torture but one that will feel quite at home in more sophisticated environments too. The Nokia 3720 classic will blend in a lot better than the Sonim XP1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, a closer look is due at what the rugged Finn is up against in terms of competition. We guess the Sonim XP1, XP3 Enduro and Sonim XP3.20 Quest are in a class of their own - probably the closest to indestructible mobile phones have ever been. The non-existent feature set and the hefty price tag don't help much either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sonim XP1 ? Sonim XP3 Enduro ? Sonim XP3.20 Quest</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It looks like the major threats for the 3720 classic come from mainstream makers like Samsung and Sony Ericsson. IP54 certification, enhanced durability and more than decent skill for the price bracket is what all contenders have in common. With the asking price of all hovering around and below the 150 euro mark, it's a tough call indeed. The good news for the Nokia 3720 classic is it hits the sweet spot between the Sony Ericsson C702 and the Samsung B2100 Xplorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The durable Cybershot is ageing and that implies a more elaborate feature set at a competitive price. The rugged Sony Ericsson handset offers fast data and video calls, GPS and Cybershot imaging but we doubt its durability is on par with the Nokia and Samsung ruggedized handset we torture-tested with our own hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C702</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B2100 Xplorer is the most basic (and cheapest) package on offer. The small and low-res screen sounds a real deal breaker and we guess even the supposedly superior shock resistance will hardly endanger the 3720 classic. The B2100 is in a lower price range really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B2100 Xplorer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tough phone by Samsung looks like the strongest competitor of the 3720 classic. The B2700 enjoys quite a headstart and beats the Nokia on a number of counts. The rugged B2700, which we tested early this year, brings quad-band GSM support, 3G and quite a few extremely relevant applications like a digital compass, pedometer and altimeter. The Nokia 3720 classic fights back with a bigger and higher-res screen and more refined styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B2700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess we'll say it again. The Nokia 3720 classic is extremely durable without looking it. That's a major point in its favor - it will win users for both its style and toughness. It's not an all-inclusive package but durability is almost uncompromised. Sounds like a lot of users will be keen to give this survivor a try.</paragraph>
