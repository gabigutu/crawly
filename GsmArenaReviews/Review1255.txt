			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD for AT&amp;T Wireless comes with some seriously heavy expectations to meet. It was back in August, when we first reported about the award winning AH-IPS screen with HD resolution, developed by LG. The unit is reportedly better than anything else on the market, including Samsung?s Super AMOLED Plus displays, and the Nitro HD is the first device to feature it in the United States. It also stands out as the first device in AT&amp;T?s impressive smartphone lineup to feature an HD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is the end of 2011 and all the cards are on the table. The LG Nitro HD is the last major player to enter the uber-smartphone competition. It surely has a spec sheet up to snuff: an HD screen to marvel at, LTE network capacity, 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, 8MP autofocus camera, etc. The list is long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Spec sheets are something we?ve come to expect in the price category, where the LG Nitro HD will compete. It is the way that the components are integrated together and the user experience they create which counts. This is what we?re going to try and find out in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we?ll kick things off with the key features and main disadvantages of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the LG Nitro HD has plenty on offer and hardly any serious flaws. It?s looks like a great fit for a flagship device. At a first glance, the latest and greatest AH-IPS screen is nothing short than a thing of beauty. The phone?s sleek and stylish body only adds to the appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest question mark is related to the battery performance of the smartphone ? there is a lot of hardware that the 1830mAh unit has to deal with. The lack of dedicated camera button and the questionable UI design are mostly a matter of personal taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, we are going to continue with unboxing and design inspection of the LG Nitro HD on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The LG Nitro HD is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail package evokes mixed feelings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the compact AT&amp;T branded retail box of the LG Nitro HD, you will find the phone, a charger, a USB cable, and a 16GB microSD card. The usual booklets are also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the 16GB card is a welcome sight in the box, we do believe that a pair of headphones would have been great as well. After all, the Nitro HD is a seriously capable multimedia device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD is one good-looking handset. Its design is clean and clutter free, while the all black color scheme adds a touch of understatement. The textured plastic on the back looks and feels great. The camera unit has been finished with a touch of brushed metal, which looks nice. So does the LG logo right under it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With measures of 133.9 x 67.8 x 10.4mm the phone is not the smallest you can find out there. Its 127 grams of weight however, make it feel light and easy to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing to fret about regarding the build quality of the LG Nitro HD. The device is very well put together and makes use of high quality materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now to the screen: the 4.5? AH-IPS screen of the LG Nitro HD lives completely up to the hype, which surrounds it. Its HD (720 x 1280 pixels) resolution gives it a pixel density, which is up there with the iPhone 4S?s. The viewing angles are superb and so is its sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to contrast however, it is still not better than the Super AMOLED Plus units which Samsung makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen you will find three touch sensitive buttons. The home button is logically in the middle. On its right side is the back key. The options and search buttons are cleverly combined into one. Long pressing it will get you into Google search, while a short press gives you the options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nitro HD is home of the volume rocker. On the right side, you will find absolutely nothing. A camera button would have been nice, we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG Nitro HD is its busiest part. There, you will find the 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation, the microUSB port, as well as the power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom of the device, you will encounter the battery cover latch, with the mouthpiece tucked into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nitro HD is home of the 8MP camera and its LED flash, as well as the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the battery cover. The microSD card of the LG Nitro HD is hot-swappable. The SIM card is not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1830mAh battery is probably the weakest link of the otherwise powerful package. Its quoted standby time is 252 hours, which is quite ambitious and far from what we have encountered so far even with LTE connectivity turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD achieved the lowest result we?ve encountered in our battery test do so far. Its score of 28 means that you will have to recharge your device every 28 hours if you use it for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing and video playback per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the full scoop on our battery test of the LG Nitro HD here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD is surprisingly nice to handle for its size. Even one-handed operation is possible. The textured plastic on the back is great in preventing accidental drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD delivered well in the design and build quality section. Now, it is time for the most important part of the device ? its software. The experience in this section is usually a deal breaker for most consumers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread with a touch of LG<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread out of the box. Google?s OS has been tweaked by a colorful, LG-made launcher, which gives it a dash of extra functionality to go with its controversial look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the smartphone in action. Check it out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen of the Nitro HD opens when you slide it upwards. It does display notifications, such as missed calls or received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen, which are visible across the homescreen panes and in the main menu. They?re Phone, Messaging, Browser and a Home/Menu button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A zoom out pinch gesture enables you to see all the available homescreen panes in one place. It has the option to set a default screen (or canvas in the LG lingo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of homescreen panes can be anything from 1 to 7. The way you place stuff on the homescreen has a nice twist. Upon a tap and hold on the display ? or by hitting the add button in the menu ? gridlines appear on the screen and the four docked icons get replaced by a taskbar with widgets, shortcuts, folders and wallpapers to choose from. Thanks to the Gesture UI, once you?ve selected an item to add you can select the homescreen to place it on by simply tilting the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and airplane mode. There are also music player controls available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom main menu has three different layouts to choose from. You can either opt for grid view with side scrollable pages or for a vertically scrollable list complete with an alphabet scroll. The last option is Category view. The default categories are Applications and Downloads but you can add new ones as needed. You can collapse/expand categories with a simple touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another way to customize your homescreen is the use of different layouts. You access them through the options button and have several preloaded for you. They include Work, Play and Travel. Of course, you can create your own custom ones as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gestures are a noteworthy feature of the LG Nitro HD. The Gesture UI covers traditional things like turn-to-mute and turn-to-snooze but it?s the extra functionality that?s more exciting. You can have panning in the gallery, browser and camera, pick up and end calls, control the media players, etc. Of course, you also have the option to disable them altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG launcher also has a shortcut for a screen capture. It is home+power/lock buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would like to give special kudos to both LG and AT&amp;T for allowing the users to remove all the unnecessary preinstalled apps, which come with the Nitro HD. An application manager is in charge of the simple process.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, and a gig of RAM, the LG Nitro HD is surely no slouch. In benchmarks it scored a mixture of commendable and downright impressive results. Check them out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the Vellamo browser benchmark, the Nitro HD produced one of the highest scores we?ve encountered so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the benchmarks and the user experience tend to differ quite often. We can happily report that we had no issues in that respect too. We found the LG Nitro HD to be quite zippy and lag free ? it handled its tasks without breaking a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A phonebook full of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays all the contacts in a list ordered alphabetically and there is an alphabet scroll on the right. There?s also a regular search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed ? First Name, Last Name or vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phone book from getting overcrowded ? you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is displayed with a contact photo and name ? a tap on the photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use those to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single contact uses a tabbed interface. The first tab is Info ? and it shows all available info for the contact with handy one-tap shortcuts for calling, messaging and so on. The next tab is History, which shows the communication history with the contact (calls, SNS updates, everything).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab is Photos which show the contacts online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can join contacts so that if you have a contact added to multiple services, all the data from them is pooled in one place. When you tap Join, the phonebook will suggest a contact based on name and it?s right most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manually pick another one if it?s wrong of course. When you add a new account, the phone will offer to import all, only some of the contacts or only those it already has in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It?s a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony doesn?t disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found no issues with the reception and the in-call quality of the LG Nitro HD. The phone performed with no fuss in the New York City area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is expectedly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts. If you do add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD offers you two virtual keyboard options out of the box. Along with the standard Android keyboard, you can also use LG?s own virtual QWERTY. Both are easy to use on the giant screen of the device. In case they don?t cut it for you, feel free to head over to the Android Market for more options.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery has been left unchanged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD uses the standard Android gallery. It automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It also boasts 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the gestures button to flip through photos and zoom-in on a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view. In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Email apps or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music layer is full of eye candy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music looks familiar but it has seen some polish. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its side reveals a cool 3D wall of all the albums you have in your music collection. Tap on an album and you?ll see a list of all songs from it. There?s an alphabet scroll at the bottom of the screen to make finding albums faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip a song or go back to the previous one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a menu to search ? for the title, the artist or the album title. After that you can pick where to search ? your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also when you?re playing a song it gets displayed in the notification area. You can also pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found no major drawbacks with the audio quality of the LG Nitro HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is simple, but capable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface ? it?s just a list of all the videos on the devices. There?s an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that?s about it. You can of course play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either ? there?s the scrubber to skip to some part of the video along with the play/pause button and next and previous buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD handled just about every video file we threw at it ? the usual 3GP and MP4 stuff along with WMV and AVIs using DivX and XviD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles worked fine too, with settings for font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there?s no option to manually point to a subtitles file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An 8MP camera is at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD packs an 8MP camera with autofocus and an LED flash. Its interface is simple and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated camera button is noticeable, but, like we mentioned before, it boils down to one?s personal taste. We believe that a camera this capable deserves one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features are limited to geo-tagging and touch focus along with ISO setting and preset scenes and effects. There?s panorama shot and continuous shot available as well. Digital image stabilization is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nitro HD is a decent performer in the camera department too. The only drawback of its shots is the relatively high level of noise in the daylight shots. If you won't be pixel-peeping your photos, you would be just fine as the colors and contrast looks good in downsampled shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of shots taken in a low-light environment. The second one uses the LED flash too. It has the white balance all wrong but at least it lights the scene adequately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With so much processing power on board, it is only natural that the LG Nitro HD can capture full HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the video recorder is no different from the one of the still camera. Along with the standard options, you can now choose to record your video without any sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a couple of from the camera of the LG Nitro HD. Check them out below. First up is a 1080p sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then here comes a 720p video sample. We also have one for download further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched 720p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is fully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD comes with a big range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and three-band HSDPA with 21 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload speeds .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LTE is undoubtedly the highlight of the connectivity suite of the smartphone. We?ve begin to encounter some spots throughout New York City where AT&amp;T?s latest generation network has gone live in testing. The download speeds we saw on the device ranged between 15 and 30 Mbps ? not bad for a yet to be launched network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app, which allows you control a DLNA network ? you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone on another device (e.g. DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct standard is still to roll on a mass scale but we finally see it on smartphones such as the LG Nitro HD. It?s a technology which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty in it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready in order for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device ? put it on a beautiful HD screen, like the Nitro?s and it is a joy to experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is minimalistic. What you get on the screen is an address bar on top, along with the major browsing options such as tabs, back/forwards buttons, and settings at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When switching between tabs, you have two viewing options. The first one allows you to flip through the pages like a deck of cards, while the second is much simpler ? it lists them for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nitro HD supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There?s text reflow too ? it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you?ve zoomed in using pinch zoom, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We played 720p videos directly in the browser with no hiccup. Full HD clips turned out a tad choppy, but played fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is complete<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there?s a preloaded document viewer and editor (well sort of).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it?s one of the most feature advanced mobile editors we?ve seen. You can of course view documents ? Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing offers almost a full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, and merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested, even better than the Windows Phone native one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Nitro HD features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. World clock is at hand as well, along with a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note Pad is self-explanatory ? it allows you to take notes and stores them with date and time for you. Nothing fancy, but it can come handy at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Google Maps offers indoor navigation as well. So far, it is limited to large shopping centers, but we still found it very cool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics, the LG Nitro HD can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.5 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go for not only apps and games, but also music, books, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been a good while since we last saw a flagship from LG. The Korean giant took its sweet time with the Nitro HD to make sure it got everything right. And on most accounts, this is the very case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the device is marvelous, the spec sheet impressive, and the OS up to date. In this department, we already know that an Ice Cream Sandwich update is in the works. We just hope we?re not going to see it roll out this time next year as in the case with the company?s previous flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE connectivity also gave us a few great initial impressions ? it further boosts the future proof credibility of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery left us with a mixed bag of feelings. We will dedicate a separate post on it when we are sure we got all the data right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the UI goes, it is a matter of taste. Some people will find it a bit too colorful, while others will love it. We can guarantee you though, that, regardless what you think of its look, its functionality is uncompromised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a price tag of $249.99 with a two-year contract on AT&amp;T?s networks, the LG Nitro LG is in the middle of the smartphone battlefield. The market is simply full of options right now. Here are several for you, which we picked out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two obvious rivals within AT&amp;T?s own LTE ranks. The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket is the latest incarnation of a legendary handset. It doesn?t have an HD screen, but the Galaxy S II still knows a few tricks, which the Nitro HD doesn?t. It is priced at $149.99 with a contract in New York but it costs more in other places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid is also an enticing (and cheaper) alternative. With a $99.99 price tag, the smartphone offers a lot of functionality to go with its LTE flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Vivid</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an already established LTE provider, Verizon Wireless has three impressive droids, which are ready to give the LG Nitro HD a run for its money. The Samsung Galaxy Nexus packs an HD screen and pure Google experience and it?s just about to launch. The HTC Rezound comes with serous multimedia credentials, while the Motorola Droid RAZR is tough, yet stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Nexus ? HTC Rezound ? Motorola Droid RAZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t forget the iPhone 4S. It might not have LTE on board, but its camera is the best 8MP shooter around. If you?re not hung on Android as your OS of choice, then you must take a look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choices are many, but few are as complete as the LG Nitro is. The device puts LG back in contention in the upper echelon of Android devices. If the company sorts the software updates out in a timely fashion and spends a few dollars on marketing, it will have a winner. We don?t believe that it has another option.</paragraph>
