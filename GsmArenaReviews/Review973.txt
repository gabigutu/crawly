			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ah, the great outdoors - not enough reception to put the "phone" in smartphone, but plenty of dust and water keep it out. Good thing there are IP67-certified phones like the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active then, combining premium specs with enough durability to survive a hike or a dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've become a little wary of the Galaxy S label, which Samsung flagships share with a number of almost unrelated devices, which simply piggyback on their reputation. That's not the case of the Galaxy S4 Active though, it's a proper flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" 1080p screen has been moved to TFT tech instead of Super AMOLED like on the regular S4, but LCD's are typically brighter, and plus LCDs are less likely to suffer water damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera situation is less clear though - Samsung downgraded it from 13MP to 8MP and while we've seen plenty of good 8MP cameras, 13MP is the current flagship standard. Everything else seems in order, however, here's the yay and nay list for the Galaxy S4 Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is not new to rugged Androids - the Galaxy Xcover line (along with carrier-specific versions) has been around for a while, but those favored durability over specs. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is not as rugged as those phones, it is a premium package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That includes the powerful chipset, the advanced connectivity, exclusive features, the works. Of course, it's not without competition - the Sony Xperia Z has been around for a while and it's clean, elegant design doesn't pay the rugged tax - the IP57-certified Xperia Z is a suave survivor. But anyway, if you search "quad-core, 1080p and water resistance" you'll find a very short list of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal hardware and the software of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active are almost identical to those of the regular S4, the real changes are on the outside. And as luck would have it, this is what we'll start off with on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9295 Galaxy S4 Active 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is slightly larger than the regular Galaxy S4 in every dimension, and the more than 1mm of extra thickness is the easiest to spot. It's also 21g heavier due to the water-proofing, the different plastic used and the different screen. It certainly adds to the solid feel of the device, but does make the smartphone a bit harder to carry around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Sony Xperia Z, the Galaxy S4 Active has virtually identical footprint and weight, but again, it's thicker by over a millimeter. Whether or not the added flexibility of a bigger, removable battery is worth it, is a question everyone should answer for themselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic floor plan of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is that of the regular Galaxy S4 (the thin bezels around the screen are a hair thicker) but there are many design cues taken from the Xcover phones. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active comes in three color versions - the bold Orange Flare and Dive Blue and the more muted Urban Grey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 recently got some new color options as well, but they are not quite as eye-catching as the Orange and Blue versions of the Active, which accentuate its rugged nature very well. The four screw caps on the back are a clear sign of "rugged".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the physical buttons on the front (capacitive buttons don't work when wet) and the new plastic on the back. It's has a honeycomb texture under a transparent glossy layer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active unit we used for the preview (the Orange Flare version) had a matte, patterned back, which we quite liked. However, the version we're reviewing - the Urban Grey - has a smooth glossy back and so does the Dive Blue version. We're yet to see a production version of the Orange Flare, but chances are it has the same smooth plastic on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The patterned plastic was better at hiding fingerprints and also provided more grip - the smooth glossy plastic is slippery even dry and it will only get worse when wet. We also wish Samsung put the same ribbed sides as on the Galaxy Xcover, they made the grip really solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we like the design of the Galaxy S4 Active - it strays away from the S III derived design that has turned Samsung's lineup into a clone army. Also, some people just prefer hardware buttons over capacitive keys, especially when the bezels are so thin, increasing the chance of accidental taps on the capacitive controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the Galaxy S4 Active is roughly similar to the regular S4. The extra thickness and weight are noticeable, but don't impede one-handed operation. It's not as sleek as the Sony Xperia Z, but that one clearly rated elegance higher than rugged appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that when we say "rugged" we mean in comparison to regular smartphones. The Galaxy S4 Active will handle dust and some water like a champ, but it's not really meant to take hard knocks so you should still be careful with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active uses a 5" 1080p LCD screen, unlike the Super AMOLED on the regular S4. It has 441 pixels per inch and while it has more sub-pixels per inch (since Super AMOLED uses a PenTile matrix), the perceived sharpness is virtually the same (the high pixel density and new sub-pixel arrangement in the latest generation Super AMOLED take care of that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD does have some tangible advantages - it's brighter, for example. The contrast and black levels aren't as great though and there's some slight contrast loss at an angle. It's a minor issue and the screen on the Galaxy S4 is among the better LCDs we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is another difference between LCD and AMOLED - colors in a gradient are more distinct on the Galaxy S4 Active display than they are on the regular S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" TFT is slightly more reflective than its Super AMOLED counterpart, which hurts sunlight legibility despite the higher brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All in all, we can't call the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active display much of a downgrade - it's the same size and resolution and it's brighter and color rendering is a tiny bit more accurate. We'll see how the different screen affects the battery life though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has the exact same set of controls as the regular S4, with the only differences mandated by the water-proof design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three controls below the screen are hardware buttons which, as we already mentioned, are more reliable than capacitive when water is involved. They, along with the Power/Lock key and the volume rocker, have a fine texture, similar to the back pattern, to improve grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key arrangement is still Menu, Home, Back, even though Android retired the Menu key and moved its functionality on-screen. This is still what you get on every Samsung, so we didn't expect anything to change here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen are the standard proximity and light sensors, but also the exclusive IR motion detector, which is used for Air Gestures (waving your hand above the phone to scroll pages, change music tracks, accept a call and so on). While we're not big fans of this feature, we can see how it makes sense here - it lets you control the Galaxy S4 Active without touching it with mud-covered hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RGB notification LED is also here, along with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and right sides of the phone feature the volume rocker and Power/Lock key respectively. The volume rocker can be set to work as a still or video shutter key, which is yet another thing that might come in handy in or around water (again, capacitive screens and buttons don't work when wet). It cannot quite replace an actual shutter key, but it's the next best thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker can also be used to activate the LED torch, even when the screen is off. Just make sure you enable this option from the settings. You can also set up an auto-off time so it doesn't drain your battery if you forget it. The volume rocker is easy to locate by touch and this will work even if the touchscreen doesn't (i.e. when it's wet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB / MHL 2.0 port is at the bottom of the phone and it is sealed with a plastic flap. Right next to it is the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top, there's the 3.5mm audio jack which is left exposed. There's a "WATERPROOF" label etched into the plastic if you need extra reassurance. Most water-resistant phones put a flap on the audio jack too, meaning you have to open it every time you want to plug in your headphones (and then remember to close it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary mic and the IR emitter are also here, the emitter is used for remote control functionality in the comfort of your own home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone packs the 8MP camera lens and the LED flash. There's no extra protection offered for the camera, which protrudes slightly, so you should take care not to damage it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the removable back cover are the 2,600mAh battery, microSIM and microSD card slots. When detached, the back cover doesn't feel particularly solid and has a hollow knock to it. That's not an issue when it's mounted on the smartphone, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is like those city slicker four-by-fours - it can go off-road, but prefers paved streets. We don't think it will take too hard knocks and walk away with it, but water shouldn't be a problem. Not that the Sony Xperia Z is much tougher - if nothing else the glass-covered rear means one more panel to scratch or crack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran our battery tests on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, expecting it to perform similarly to the I9505 Galaxy S4 (same chipset and battery, different screen). In the end the LCD drew noticeably more power during video playback and with a slightly lower talk time, the S4 Active scored an endurance rating of 57 hours. That's not as good as the 69 hours of the regular S4, but it's still a very good result - go to our blog for more details.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz is stuffed with features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active comes with the same software as its non-rugged sibling. This means the latest Android, 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, and a laundry list of new TouchWiz features. The Galaxy S4 family combines the best of both worlds and while it seems familiar, there's plenty new below the surface - so much in fact that you'd need a couple of days just to get accustomed to all the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface video to start you off, which also shows the new air and motion gestures in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which features the new lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message. You have to enable an option in the Settings to get all the widgets, while you're there you can also enable the beautiful random wallpapers from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though, if you prefer, you can switch back to the old one or disable it all together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you enable that option the lockscreen offers multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting on the lockscreen by hitting the edit button. You can type something else, choose a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen that shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info. This is just one of many Air Gestures, we'll see the rest later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the new button that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 20 in total. A two finger swipe works too. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to get more room for notifications. The Auto toggle automatically adjusts the brightness but you can use the slider to tweak that, depending on whether you want a darker or brighter display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's a wraparound feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button, you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changer really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer (this is what stock Android dictates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works in a similar way to the homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails which you can rearrange (but not delete). There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps (apps can be swiped to dismiss) and three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active comes with Multi-window. This lets you run two apps side by side on the screen. The dividing line between the apps can be moved to give one more space and there's a full screen button if you no longer need the other app. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab, while Wi-Fi settings ar ein Connectin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. Despite pilling feature upon feature, the whole thing really feels intuitive and well organized. There's still a learning curve, but it mostly involves users finding out they can tweak TouchWiz to their liking or that they have some functionality out of the box (where other phones would need third-party apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has put a lot of work into Jelly Bean to make the interface buttery smooth and the powerful hardware inside the Galaxy S4 Active contributes too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Air and Motion gestures, Smart Screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active comes with a number of advanced features enabled by the powerful hardware and dedicated sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. There's no S Pen on the Galaxy S4, or a need for it - the phone can detect your finger hovering over the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This enables information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on), previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (works with previous button too), previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers 1cm / 0.5" away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another set of "air" features are the Air Gestures. Quick Glance is one of them, but there's more. These air commands are triggered by waving your hand over the Galaxy S4 Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use this to scroll web pages in the browser (vertical waves), switch between tabs (horizontal waves), move between tracks in the music player and photos in the gallery, accept a call, move app shortcuts and S Planner events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air Gestures can detect your hand up to 7cm (just under 3") and might prove useful in some situations. Note that only the native apps support them, third party apps will not work with them (even Chrome that comes preinstalled on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Display features, Smart Stay and Smart Rotate, are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen (the accelerometer gets this wrong if you're lying on your side).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is one of the two new features - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get it right the first time, but after that you can tilt your head down to scroll down and up to scroll back up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second new feature is simpler and more useful - Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's older motion gestures are here too. There's direct call (dial the contact whose info you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot (but so does holding down the Home and Power buttons, which we find easier).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is preloaded on the Galaxy S4 Active. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy S4 Active to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the S4 Active also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget for the homescreen or lockscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active packs a Snapdragon 600 chipset with four Krait 300 cores clocked at 1.9GHz, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. Those are exactly the same specs as the I9505 Galaxy S4 has, so we're expecting identical results, within a margin of error.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi pretty much describes the performance - single-threaded tasks fly on the Krait 300 core, clocked higher than the competition. By the way, the I9500 Galaxy S4 with Exynos 5 Octa posted a score very similar to its Snapdragon 600 based siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack actually showed an advantage for the Galaxy S4 Active, but the difference is only about 4%. Geekbench 2 also showed a similar score, within 5%. As far as CPU performance - both single and multithreaded - is concerned, the Galaxy S4 Active is one of the fastest handsets you can buy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In full system benchmarks AnTuTu and Quadrant the Galaxy S4 Active scored a little lower than the regular Galaxy S4, which means performance isn't perfectly identical (there are small differences in the firmwares the two phones run, which probably explains it). Still, it's not something you're likely to notice in real-life usage.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.5 and 2.7 were run in 1080p offscreen mode, so results can be compared against other devices, but for the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active that's the native resolution too. The 2.5 version of the benchmark put the S4 (Snapdragon 600) and S4 Active on equal ground, while there was a 1fps difference in 2.7. Either way, there are no smartphones (Android or otherwise) that score higher, so you won't have any problems with games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To verify that, we ran Epic Citadel, which uses the popular Unreal Engine 3. The S4 Active scored very close to the 60fps limit, meaning there were very few occasions when gaming won't be at 60fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>JavaScript performance proved to be inexplicably lower than what the regular S4 has to offer. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is still a very fast device, but not as fast as it should be on this test. The BrowserMark score was within 5% of the regular S4 score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo, which runs a whole battery of web tests, reports all is good in terms of performance, but it's a finicky benchmark, the Galaxy Note II still holds the crown there (granted it only had to render pages at 720p instead of 1080p).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is top notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Galaxy S4 Active packs an incredibly wide range of features. Four tabs on top provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A call or a message to someone can be triggered directly from the contact list with a right and left swipes respectively, which is really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you, even just prefixes (e.g. block foreign calls). It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy S4 is really something. It's almost too advanced for some users but its interfaces is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you find your feet around you will appreciate having cool extras like call barring, which stock and most other forms of Android lack.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active offers top notch quality and managed to hold onto reception with ease. Earpiece volume is great and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders if you want an even louder experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app on the Galaxy S4 Active features Smart Dial, which searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is here too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. If you use quick dial but forgot which contact is assigned to which number, you can use Air View as a quick reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android. Another way to answer a call is to wave your hand over the phone (that's another Air Gesture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active scored a Good mark. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with room for customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: a list of all your messages organized into threads with a Compose message button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a right swipe starts a call, while a left swipe starts a new message (a little redundant, but it's good if you have the habit of swiping left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy S4 Active displays an additional row above the letters for numbers - kind of like a full-fledged computer keyboard does and unlike most on-screen keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Swipe-like mode which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool option is the floating keyboard that takes up less space on the screen and can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional input methods include Voice input (this works offline), Handwriting recognition and even OCR (snapping a photo of text and having the phone type it in automatically, requires a data connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different bubbles and background and can use the volume button to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you don't get the option to choose your own colors for either the conversation bubble which we would've liked to see. The background can be changed according to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will come in good use, however, is the new Direct call (again) feature. When you are reading a message from someone, their number will be automatically dialed by just lifting the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in spam prevention. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has received a new fresher UI, but its main functionality has remained mostly intact. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a specific message will archive it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email app supports Air view, which upon a hover over an email gives you a peek into said email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper-left corner you'll find a context menu prompt, which lists all your folders. It's not accessible through a swipe from the side so you'll need to tap the mail icon each time you want to gain access to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk was replaced with the new Hangouts app. It handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network used to be compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts, but Google is moving to close it off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery does it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy S4 Active has a new layout. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a Scalado-like spiral of images and video, which after a while gets really nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails (two or three thumbnails per row). Air view lets you hover your finger above and image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail overview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar on the left with the albums. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a nifty detect text option in the Gallery's context menu, which does as advertised - it detects text on an image and converts it into a text file, which you can share via mail, messages, etc. Keep in mind that it requires a data connection to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player adapts its sound to your headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S4 Active is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support, which is quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players. There are more tabs available - you can hide or show tabs from the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Volume, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asking if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy S4 Active plays you a demo of the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The best video player in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The best video player found on smartphones just got better. The new video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is a true quad-core tour de force - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome preview and it shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active managed to play all files we threw at it. DivX and XviD along with MP4, AVI and MKV were no problem for the Galaxy S4 Active and there were no issues with the audio codecs either - not even the usually problematic AC3 videos caused any trouble.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active did greatly in our audio quality test. We can't really say we are surprised as it matches the output of the two regular Galaxy S4 versions and we already know those to be some of the nicest sounding smartphones around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9295 Galaxy S4 Active had absolutely flawless output when connected to an active external amplifier, producing excellent scores all over the field. Its volume levels aren't the highest we have seen, but it should just just fine for 99% of the occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively enough, there's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Save for the barely detectable (in the lab, let alone with a naked ear) hike in stereo crosstalk the output remains perfect. A really solid showing by the rugged droid here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active packs an 8MP camera, just like the Galaxy S II and S III. It snaps photos with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a 2MP camera on the front too and both can shoot 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. The viewfinder is handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the cool settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter keys. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops he text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one is the arrow at the bottom of the screen, which brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be used very often. Still, there a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy S4 Active will name photos with your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we did notice is that there are fewer manual settings - the Galaxy S II and S III used to let you tweak all photo parameters, while the Galaxy S4 Active just gives you an ISO setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Rich Tone (HDR), Panorama, Night and Sports but also the exclusive Aqua mode for underwater shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time you launch Aqua mode it asks you what function you want to assign to the volume rocker - the capacitive screen won't work, so you have to use the volume rocker. Then you get a reminder to close the microUSB port to prevent water damage (you get this every time). Aqua mode tunes image processing as shooting underwater is quite different than above water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas are pretty impressive, they go a full 360 circle or more and has about 8MP (the regular S4 panoramas go up to 60MP). Note that if you hold the phone vertically, the panorama image will have nearly more than twice the resolution. Here's a sample panorama - the stitching is pretty good, unless there are moving objects to trip it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic beauty touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p. Another way to capture moving objects is Animated Photo, which creates cinemagrams. The result is an animated GIF file, though we have to say we liked Nokia's implementation better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines if you're at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot. All the Galaxy S4 Active would send is the still image, a JPEG, and the sound remains on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos shot with the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active are comparable to Galaxy S III photos. The noise levels are low and there's plenty of detail. Colors are mostly accurate, though the green channel saturation has been boosted (typical for Samsung phones), which also throws off the white balance a bit. While we would have preferred a 13MP camera, the 8MP shooter of the Galaxy S4 Active produces very good photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The field of view is virtually identical to that of the Galaxy S III and wider than the Galaxy S4 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active also has an HDR mode (called Richtone), which can help with high dynamic range scenes. It does a good job of bringing out detail both in the highlights and in the shadows, but it affects color rendering.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active camera is very much the same as the cameras on last year's flagships. You can also pit it against the 13MP camera of the regular Galaxy S4 and the water-resistant Sony Xperia Z using the upscale/downscale options in our Photo compare too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video camera gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active stores videos in MP4 files with 17Mbps bitrate on average. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera doesn't have many fancy shooting modes like the still camera, but dual shot is available and you can do slow-motion and time lapse videos. Slow-motion videos can go up to 8x slow down, but resolution drops to 800 x 450 and framerate to 15fps. Time lapse videos can speed things up to 8x, with resolution and framerate remaining at 1080p @ 30fps (time lapse actually requires less processing power than regular video capture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 6MP (16:9) photos during recording as well, but images come out with very different image processing than what you get from the still camera - the contrast and saturations are boosted way up and there's a good deal of overshaprening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy S4 have a good of fine detail and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images, overall accurate but slightly oversaturated (especially in the green channel). The continuous autofocus triggered a bit too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, the field of view for the camera is similar to that of the Galaxy S III and wider than the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a FullHD video sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an untouched video sample from the Galaxy S4 Active you can download - 1080p @ 30fps (0:07s, 14.9MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All the latest connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G. An LTE-variant of the device will also be available for supported regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's latest Android flagship uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes a/b/g/n, as well as the new ac standard, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the S4 and other later-generation S devices back-to-back. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more thoroughly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content from nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the My Video app and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL 2.0 port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL 2.0 port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those can be hard to come by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy S4 screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL 2.0 port has yet another feature - it features USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straightforward - you plug it into the Galaxy S4 Active and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser now supports gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has the hardware specs to propel it to great heights of user experience. The pretty large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the S4 Active's new Air Gestures support, you can flip between open tabs by simply swiping left and right across the screen, or scroll up and down by doing the same vertically. It takes a bit of getting used to, but is a neat feature once mastered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air View, Smart Scroll and Smart Stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your finger over a web element and it will act as if a mouse cursor was over it instead, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy S4 Active becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there weren't any games preloaded on our unit but you can grab some from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for just your devices - you can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app can work together with Photo Reader, which employs Optical Character Recognition so you can just snap a photo of the text instead of having to type it in (which can be quite a challenge, imagine typing Chinese if you've never studied it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course) and comments. You can also set reminders for shows you want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players and streaming media players. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides a pleasant interface which gives you an at-a-glance look at your progress, as well as walking, exercise, and fitness trackers. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enables it to give even more detailed info on your status.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office Editor a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Disappointingly, the Galaxy S4 Active gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, instead of the full-fledged editor. The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. It can present the document as is or reflow the text to fit on the screen. There's also a text to speech option, so the phone can read the doc out loud (it will also offer to install a better TTS engine, which weighs in at about 100MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is as robust as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only limited info on the events for the day, but thanks to Air View you can point to a day to read the full description of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer. They are easy to work with and can come in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been familiar with the S Memo app ever since its debut on the Galaxy Note, and its functionality remains more or less the same. It allows you to create notes either via a virtual keyboard or simply by doodling with your finger. Samsung even sell a special display-friendly ball pen for enthusiasts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in couple of minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. The barometer, however, can speed up GPS locks even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play, Samsung Apps and Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also offers a store for books and games through Samsung Hub. The Book also offers a preview - the first few pages of a book. You can read reviews of the book, written only by people who have bought it. You can also read a synopsis, about the author and search for more books by that author.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section of Samsung Hub just launches Samsung Apps when you tap on a game.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is certainly worthy of carrying the Galaxy S4 name, but are there genuine reasons to pick it over the regular S4? The IP57-level water resistance is nice, but it's not something that can't be added with a third-party case. Admittedly, a thick, heavy and ugly case, not suitable for everyday use (but then you can put it on only when needed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, your Facebook photo album from the summer can look very different with the Galaxy S4 Active - you can take photos where you wouldn't before (not with your phone, not with a digital camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll also be less wary taking your phone fishing or on a boat. There are apps for marine navigation and weather, for example, so you can use your S4 Active for that instead of a dedicated unit. Apps for fishing exist too, but the most important point to be made here is that a water resistant smartphone has uses you may not have thought of before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Escaping from the ubiquitous design of the Galaxy S4 and the Super AMOLED display may be an additional perk for some - we've heard and read plenty of complaints about both and this is a chance to get Galaxy S4 specs without either of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 - either the I9500 with Exynos 5 Octa or the I9505 with Snapdragon 600 - make a fine alternative if you prefer thin and light over water resistant. They also pack a Super AMOLED screen and a 13MP camera without costing extra.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is thin too and certainly prettier, unless you are into the rugged charm of the S4 Active. But its LCD screen has poor viewing angles, the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset is not up to par with Snapdragon 600 and the smaller battery (2,330mAh vs. 2,600mAh) is non-removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR has a smaller screen - 4.55", 720p - which makes it slightly more compact (and potentially cheaper too, it's not on sale yet). It also carries an IP58 certification, making it even more resilient to water.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Huawei also has its hat in the game - the Ascend D2. While the K3V2 chipset is no performance monster, with a 5" 1080p screen, 13MP camera and 32GB of built-in (non-expandable) storage and 3,000mAh battery, the D2 is a worthy contender.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is not the best smartphone in the Samsung lineup, but if you add "that I can put in water," things definitely change. It's a very good 2013 flagship aimed at people who until recently had very few options - as you can see there aren't many high-end smartphones with water resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure not everyone needs to have an IP57 certified handset, but if it doesn't cost anything in terms of overall smartphone performance than it certainly doesn't hurt having it. Initially it may just give you peace of mind, knowing that you won't ruing your vacation by dropping your expensive smartphone in the water, but at some point you'll inevitably want to explore the opportunities that an element-defying handset gives you.</paragraph>
