			<paragraph>Another sleek Motorola clamshell is hitting the market. The lavish design is key again, functionality gets to the next level.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that the RAZR V3 by Motorola has become an icon. Success was huge as regards design, so Motorola keeps on trying to replicate it in new models. A compact bunch of models, pretty similar to the RAZR in appearance, comes under the KRZR label. The firstborn was named KRZR K1. Today we are featuring its successor: the KRZR K3. It brings a number of innovations, but continues to suffer from some of the inherited weaknesses that get passed down the Motorola family.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design comes first<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first KRZR made a name for itself with its cool design. A blue-bodied flashy handset, dazzling and captivating. The new KRZR K3 goes even further, leaving no doubt that design is all that matters here. The phone does look sharp and will not go unnoticed, not even in the most exclusive surroundings. The great first impression the phone makes, is enhanced by the high quality materials used on its bodywork. Steel and glass dominate. The phone's body is especially solid: no wobbling or creaky sounds, a true creation of Motorola's craftsmanship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has the following dimensions 103 x 42 x 16 mm - it is quite taller than other models of similar construction, which is good. The elongated silhouette gives an edge and a sense of importance to the KRZR's image. The phone weighs 110 g due to the significant amount of steel used on its body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A black background covering glass on the front plate protects both the external display and the lens of the 2-megapixel camera. There is a fine grill a few millimeters beneath the external display, which is an interesting element, but its purpose remains mystery to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front plate is dominated by silver-blue steel surface. Unfortunately, all glossy areas, including the covering glass on the front side of the phone, are extremely prone to fingerprints. Constant cleaning is the only remedy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sides are covered with black plastic material and feature a few buttons. The camera release button is situated on the right, while the dual volume control key and the "smart key" are on the left. The left side also features a miniUSB connector hidden under a plastic cap, in which you can plug a charger, data cable or earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us also mention the eccentric jut at the base of the body, the so called "chin" - a typical element of all Motorola clamshells. Etched on its front is the manufacturer's logo; the dimple-patterned surface of its sides is a nice touch adding to the phone's exclusivity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Trademark surface on the back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR K3 battery lies beneath a wide cover on the back removable through a special release key. The Li-Ion battery has a capacity of 910 mAh. It is said to provide about 340 hours of stand-by or 180 minutes of talk time. Next to the battery you will see two slots one above the other - the first one is for the SIM card, the upper one is for a microSD memory card. We used a 1GB memory card during the tests of MotoKrzr K3 and we met no difficulties at all. The rest of the back plate is dedicated to the loud speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire back panel of the phone, including the battery cover, features the Motorola-patented Soft-touch finish, which prevents the phone from slipping on flat surfaces. It looks like steel, but feels like rubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tiny spring locks the folding part of the phone to its final position, and makes for a smooth opening and closing. Motorola KRZR K3 opens easily with a single hand too. The joint wobbles a bit, nothing we couldn't live with, given we tested a pre-sales piece. Hopefully the release version won't have this flaw. The wrist band eyelet is on the right side of the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad too flat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad is steel-plated, key symbols and the separation grid are etched in. As a result, the keypad is perfectly flat. The lines of the separation grid don't stand out. The only keys made of different material and thus unmistakably recognizable by touch are the 5-key and the four-way navigation D-pad with its confirming center. That means that during typing it is necessary to concentrate on the keypad far more than on the display. As usual, however, it is all a matter of getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation key is surrounded by two context keys, keys for making and ending calls, a key for video calls, a key starting the WAP browser, and a delete key, which also takes you back one level up in the menu. All these keys are big enough and comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same holds true for the alpha-numerical part of the keypad. Key response is solid, accompanied by a quiet click marking the activation of the sensor beneath the corresponding key. Yet, we think the Motorola KRZR K3 isn't the keen texter stuff because of its vague touch orientation. Symbols are illuminated in bright bluish-green. Backlighting is even and powerful enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Way to go for both displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR has two displays. The external one is the same like in Motorola RAZR V6 maxx and by a centimeter longer than the one in the first KRZR. It offers a resolution of 120 x 160 pixels on a surface of 19 x 26 mm and displays 65K colors. Motorola claims the external display uses active TFT technology - a hard to verify fact given how dull the colors appear. Legibility under direct sunlight though is surprisingly good. We can still hope that the external display of the retail version will be tweaked up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone is in stand-by mode, the external display shows the same wallpaper as the inner one. Additionaly, basic details are shown, including time and date. After the phone's been idle for a certain time, the active wallpaper switches off and a digital clock only is displayed. Icons announcing missed events are not available, unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external display on stand-by ? selecting a ringing profile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal display has improved too. It is a few millimeters bigger and its resolution has increased from 176 x 220 pixels (in KRZR K1) to 240 x 320 pixels. Viewing images on the 262 color TFT display is truly enjoyable. The finest details come out admirably, never mind the small size of the display. Brightness settings are the same for both the external and the internal display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's also mention the tiny video-call camera with VGA resolution situated below the internal display. It can be used for self-portraits too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Old icons on the menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface and the functional menu of Motorola KRZR K3 have not moved on significantly from what we've seen in Motorola RAZR V6 maxx, though a few notable improvements stand out. Even so, first-time Motorola users should be patient, as the menu requires a bit of getting used to. Searching for functions and settings every now and then will be inevitable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: The images here are of the Motorola RAZR V6 Maxx display, which features the same user interface and functional menu as Motorola KRZR K3. The differences in user interface between both phones are negligible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standard service indicators are placed at the very top of the stand-by display; beneath are the operator logo and date, as well as the active ringing profile. The clock - digital of analogue - can be found above the soft-key shortcuts at the bottom of the display. Of course, any type of image or photo can serve as a wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functions assigned to each direction of the navigation D-pad can also be placed on the stand-by display. Besides, shortcuts can be assigned to any of the approximately 50 functions on the two context keys and the left "soft key" of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessed through a press on the center of the D-pad. Motorola has been using the same icons for years now and Motorola KRZR K3 is no exception. Liking them or not is a matter of personal taste, but we do think they're pretty obsolete now. Distributing the icons and organizing them in a list is user-configurable, which remains one of the strengths of the Motorola menus. Sub-menus contain mostly text, but occasionally, you may also find icons here. The phone offers three color schemes. And, as usual, certain items of the main menu are hidden in deeper menu levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general terms, the phone responds promptly to user commands. Selected options are confirmed through the center of the D-pad. The "correction" key marked with a C and a reversed arrow takes you a level up in the menu. The right context key does the same.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: 2 vertical megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera has a 2-megapixel resolution. Pictures are displayed vertically, unfortunately; their maximum size is set at 1200 x 1600 pixels. The camera features no flash or auto focus. Image quality isn't configurable either. Images are often not focused, details tend to be blurred. Given the absence of auto focus, neither close-ups, nor text come out well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is activated by pressing the key on the phone's right side, but it takes too long before it's ready to shoot. The entire display serves as a view-finder. At the bottom of the display you'll find a practical menu for instant access to most of the camera settings. You can adjust exposure compensation and white balance; activate night mode, use color effects or the 8x digital zoom (whch only crops the image). Further, a standard menu opens through the respective context key, where you can also adjust compression quality, resolution, the sound of the lens shutter or activate the self-timer function. From here you can also switch to the internal VGA camera suitable for video calls. Self-portraits can be made with the main camera by using the external display as a viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR K3 sample images</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras shoot video in 3GP format. Yet, the maximum available video resolution continues to be limited to 176 x 144 pixels, considered way too low nowadays. Video length is only limited by the available free memory. Given the low resolution, we are not going to publish video samples of this camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can be saved into the phone's internal memory (approximately 50 MB), or onto a microSD memory card. Motorola's newly developed Media Browser has also been implemented in KRZR K3. It stores all multimedia files organized by type, hence searching your videos, music and pictures is very easy. Pictures can be viewed in full screen or filed into albums at user's choice. To make image browsing faster, the phone first preloads a lower quality preview. Fully-fledged images are loaded when you pause browsing for a second - the current image then loads in normal viewing quality. Details on both internal memory and memory card are displayed simultaneously. Direct image print is also available trough the PictBridge standard support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An ample phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Telephony functions are very good. The phonebook stores up to 2000 contacts, which is not really something you see too often. Each contact can be assigned various fields like first name, last name, nickname, six phone numbers, three electronic and street addresses, ringtone, picture, note, and a birth date (does not appear in the calendar automatically). However, the option of distinguishing callers by ringtones is flawed by a long-lasting weakness, present in nearly all Motorola phones. The ringtone assigned to a particular contact is played even when a text message from them arrives so when it goes off you would never know if they're calling or texting you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the respective name. All contacts from both the phone memory and the SIM card can be displayed together. They can also be organized into groups, of which each can be assigned an image and a ringtone. Voice dialing and a loud speaker are available too, but the phone lacks a voice recorder and call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR K3 has a total of 6 ringing profiles, offering a wide range of setup options. Profile names indicate the behavior of the vibration alert (not user-configurable). At least, the phone can ring and vibrate simultaneously, which is definitely good news. Profiles can be changed even with the phone folded. And, of course, any music file of any format stored in the phone, be it MP3, AAC, WMA or MID, can be set as a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR works in 3G networks, which is one of the crucial advantages ofer the original KRZR K1. A VGA camera beneath the main display is meant for video calls. However, the main 2 megapixel camera can also be used for the same purpose. It is also possible to show selected images from the phone memory instead of the live video feed. Besides UMTS, the Motorola KRZR has tri-band GSM support. The type of network currently in service is indicated by a tiny icon on the stand-by display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Likeable iTap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR K3 communicates over SMS, MMS and email. Sending voice messages as MMS is enabled. SMS and MMS have the same editor. The iTap editor enhances texting experience. Motorola claim the iTap can learn new words, even if it's not activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor has a counter of available characters left. Images, pictures, voice notes, video records or even business cards from the phonebook can be inserted in the text. The entire message then gets sent as an MMS. Yet, there's a catch in messaging: delivery notifications. Since it's impossible to permanently activate the delivery notification feature, you'll have to request notification before sending each individual message. Motorola support the EMS standard for sending icons and mono sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All received messages, except for emails, are kept in a single folder. Messages display in 7 lines. We could not establish exactly how many SMS the phone is able to save, but they count hundreds for sure. The exact number depends on the size of each SMS, but the limit is supposed to be about 500. Any sound file in the phone can be set as an SMS alert tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 protocols. It manages attachments smoothly. The maximum size of attachments for download is user-definable. Mail can be checked manually or automatically in regular intervals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The calendar: seasoned performer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, the main organizing function is the calendar. It can contain both standard events and tasks, all of them displayed together. The calendar can be set to repeat events in a preset order. Each task can be assigned a priority and a mark-off option. The calendar offers a monthly, weekly, and daily view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR K3 has 5 alarm clocks, which could also be used as reminders thanks to a special option that lets you insert descriptions. They will wake you up with any of the available tones no matter if the phone is on or off. The alarm clock application does not offer repetition and thus requires setup each day. The handset also boasts a calculator including a unit converter, a world time application, and a voice recorder - the recording time is limited only by the memory available. Pity the Motorola KRZR doesn't offer text notes, indeed. A special Java application could be a small consolation, however, it saves notes on a remote server. The phone has the so-called K3 Help application, which gets you acquainted with your device. The Motorola Setup application is used for instant setup of data transfers, WAP, MMS, and for archiving your contacts and messages on a remote server.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Better music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the most serious flaws of the first KRZR was the integration of two music players, none of which worked well enough. This in fact is a longstanding Motorola fault. It was not before the RAZR V6 maxx that improvements were made. Fortunately, KRZR K3 offers a completely revamped and far better music player than its predecessors. The new music player can be minimized to run in the background and manages the following formats: MP3, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, WMA, and WAV. The player indexes music files in order to work with them faster afterwards. It works with ID3 tags too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tracks can be sorted by artist, album, genre, and composer or grouped into user-configurable playlists. There are no equalizer presets, but the sound can be refined by adjusting the bass and spatial effect. Repeat and shuffle are available as well. When the phone is folded, the music player is controlled through the keys on the sides of the phone. Playlists appear on the external display. You can skip songs, pause playing, as well as adjust volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Selecting a song and playing it on the external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best way to enjoy music on the Motorola KRZR K3 is with the wireless Bluetooth earphones. The phone supports the A2DP Bluetooth profile. You can use the Motorola DJ S805 wireless earphones with it, for example. Their sound quality is splendid. As we didn't have a copy of the standard wired headset delivered in the retail package, we cannot make judgments about its qualities. The loudspeaker sounds great too. The phone doesn't have an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The main display of the music player ? player menu and settings ? stand-by display during playing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking about entertainment, let us also mention the video player and the Java games installed in the phone. The video player can play videos in fullscreen and fast-forward and rewind them. It manages 3GP and MP4 formats. We found 6 demo versions of various Java games in the phone. The question, of course, is if they'd still be demos in the retail version of the Motorola KRZR K3. Java applications run not that fast, but they can be minimized in background, which is a great plus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lightning fast data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like Motorola RAZR V6 maxx, the KRZR K3 also has support for HSDPA or 3.5G as some call it. It enables you to receive and send data at a theoretical speed of up to 3.6 Mb/s, which is comparable to home ADSL internet access. The phone also offers EDGE and GPRS Class 10, if HSDPA is not available. Motorola KRZR K3 can be connected to a computer via Bluetooth or through the miniUSB connector using a standard miniUSB cable or the one included in the package. The memory card appears on the PC as a new storage device. KRZR K3 starts to charge automatically as soon as it has been connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated browser is developed by Opera. It features extensive setup options and manages simple websites with ease. Font size can be modified. It is even possible to disable images, sounds, and JavaScript. Internet pages can be viewed in fullscreen too. Enclosed in the Motorola KRZR K3 package you should also find a CD with the Motorola Phone Tools software, which is usually paid for. It helps you synchronize the phonebook of the phone with your calendar in Outlook and use the phone as a modem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>RAZR or KRZR?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The key aspect of Motorola KRZR K3 is design. Its functional menu is rich enough, but appearance is likely to come first when it gets to consumer attraction. On the other hand, appearance is easily blemished by the excessive susceptibility of the phone's front to finger prints. As far as features are concerned, a few drawbacks are notable, that have been present in Motorola phones for years: you cannot set delivery notification permanently, poor video capturing resolution, or the ringing SMS alert when a ringtone has been assigned to a contact, just to name a few. At the same time, Motorola KRZR K3 wins points with its HSDPA support, its high-quality music player and its miniUSB connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the moment Motorola's portfolio features two lifestyle clamshells: the KRZR K3 and the RAZR V6 maxx. You can see our full-featured of RAZR V6 maxx here. There's almost no difference between them in terms of software; the RAZR has a camera LED flash, which lacks in the KRZR K3, a bigger main display, external sensor keys to control the music player, and light effects. On the other hand, the KRZR K3 has exquisite bodywork and is smaller. That way or another, design most probably will be the battlefield to win consumer preference.</paragraph>
