		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Proceed with caution, big Snapdroids ahead. We guess that sign is due wherever someone mentions Desire HD. It?s big and bad and it takes no prisoners. HTC certainly took their time with releasing a bad-ass Android handset on our side of the pond but their timing is perfect now. We?re about to enter the holiday shopping spree and HTC Desire HD is in for the kill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powered by the latest Android 2.2 Froyo hand in hand with the latest HTC Sense, the HTC Desire HD is what the HD2 was to HTC Windows Mobile portfolio. With an 8-megapixel camera and HD video it may as well unsettle quite a few of the top smartphones out there. The innovative fast boot, the complete connectivity set and solid multimedia capabilities round off a great package. HTC might just have a natural bestseller on their hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might want to have a closer look:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s more to it. The HTC Desire HD is a mongrel. It doesn?t even warrant a name of its own. Desire is cheesy and HD is worn-out. And they both are OLD phones? names. Alright, don?t take it literally. It?s not as simple as saying HTC got themselves a brand new phone out of two older ones. The HTC Desire HD goes beyond the massive screen and powerful hardware that we?ve already seen elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But whatever the name ? bad Snapdroids get all the attention. And we have one at our hands and no time to lose. Unboxing and hardware follow right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Desire HD unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the HTC Desire HD has pretty standard contents: a USB charger, standard microUSB data cable and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a one-piece headset with music controls (play/pause/skip) and a CD with HTC Sync. The supplied headphones aren't your only option though, since the Desire HD has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also enclosed is an 8GB microSD card. The only thing we miss is a carrying pouch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire HD 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 4.3? screen, the Desire HD is one massive Snapdroid. Just the sound of this is enough to frighten, impress, excite and entice. On a more sober note, the enormous screen has its consequences. The overall size of the phone has crossed some usability lines for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD isn?t the first phone with a screen this size though. And in fairness, the use of space is quite good. Next to the Samsung Galaxy S, the Desire HD doesn?t look all that huge ? and the difference in screen estate is meaningful. Anyway, at 123 x 68 x 11.8 mm, we still find the Desire HD perfectly manageable. The thin waistline does reasonably well to make the height and width of the handset acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 164 grams is something to definitely consider. It is a heavy phone ? hardly a surprise for this size. But it?s a phone that feels very solid and durable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s all in the name really. We?re looking at a phone we?ve already seen: the unibody design and finish of the original Desire, and the proportions and screen size of the HTC HD2. It?s a mix that works we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unibody design does make the whole thing a little more subtle and manageable. The finish is fingerprint resistant and provides a great grip. The build is good ? we?d call it great, was it not for some minor details that seem to adversely affect both the usability and aesthetics of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover on the side of the phone and the lid of the SIM/memory card compartment at the bottom don?t seem to firmly fit in place. Not to mention they?re both quite difficult to open. That?s probably OK ? we don?t want a loose battery cover that will pop open at will. But we don?t wanna see unpleasant gaps in the body of a premium gadget either. And that includes the patch of plastic around the LED flash too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the entire front is occupied by the 4.3? capacitive touchscreen. We?ll say it again: well done HTC for not making the bezel too wide. It?s nearly all screen up front and it looks great. HTC dropped AMOLED in favor of LCD and honestly, we?re not impressed ? but more on that a little later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD screen is supposed to be one of the highlights of the HTC Desire HD. We have no issues with sensitivity ? the capacitive unit has great response and silky smooth, precise performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we don?t mind the image quality either. Watching videos and browsing, and reading text, are all nice and comfortable on a screen that size and resolution. The viewing angles and sunlight legibility are above average too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the depth of blacks and the overall contrast falls obviously short of Super AMOLEDs and Retina displays. When you put the handset next to a phone using a superior display technology, it really does make a difference. The viewing angles are not that spectacular either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only find the earpiece, a status LED, as well as ambient light and proximity sensors embedded within it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Android buttons (Home, Context menu, Back and search) are right below the display. They?re capacitive controls ? and the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless. You can?t help but notice the absence of a trackpad. It would?ve only made sense in landscape mode anyway. There?s no way to comfortably hold such a heavy phone in portrait and use a trackpad squeezed at the very bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the device hosts the volume rocker only. It?s a thin button that?s quite stiff and with such low stroke there?s almost no confirmation of a press being registered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The patch of plastic around the volume rocker is the battery cover. Inside there?s nothing to lock the battery in place, and it will simply fall off when you open the lid. That?s the reason why the phone will immediately turn off when you release the cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing we miss on the right-hand side is a dedicated camera button. It doesn?t make sense really ? the Desire HD is the closest to a cameraphone we?ve seen HTC get and that?s not enough to warrant a proper shutter key. The Desire Z, for instance, has one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing to note at the top is the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone features the microUSB port, the mouthpiece and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the HTC Desire HD is the 8 megapixel camera lens, stuck between the loudspeaker grill and the dual LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens sticks out the same way the HTC HD2 camera did and it?s still the natural place for your index finger to rest when holding the phone during calls. There?s no lens protection ? except for a slight embedding ? even carrying it in your pocket you risk getting it scratched. HTC did nothing in the Desire HD?s defense. The HD2 for instance did have a carrying pouch in the retail box. There?s no such thing in the Desire HD package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the time of the review, we managed to scratch the dark-painted metallic edge around the lens just by putting the phone down on the desk and picking it up back again. So we guess, in real-life usage, that will be the most vulnerable spot on the phone?s paint finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1230 mAh battery. It is quoted at 420 hours of stand-by and 5 and a half hours of talks in a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic lid at the bottom covers the SIM compartment and the microSD card slot. Releasing it won?t cause the phone to power off ? as opposed to the battery cover. You can hot-swap the memory card when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD is a solid and generally well-built phone. The unibody has good ergonomics and makes the otherwise big set more comfortable to handle. We like the finish too for both its smudge-resistance and secure grip. Our only concern are the patches of plastic at the rear (battery and SIM lids, LED flash casing). They don?t seem to fit tightly and the resulting gaps are particularly unpleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, it?s a big but manageable handset ? the big screen is an obvious advantage and HTC couldn?t have done a better job of building the phone around it. Perhaps, we?re getting used to big screens, are we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI stretches in legs on a 4.3? screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest HTC Sense UI for Android is debuting on two new Desire phones ? the Desire HD and the Desire Z. The UI customization goes deep as usual and there?s a fair amount of new stuff from HTC too (like the HTCSense.com integration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is the first in the pipeline so we?ll take the opportunity to get into the details of what has changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the outside, it is very familiar to previous iterations but there is some fine tuning that has gone into the latest version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there are three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu. The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Personalize" menu. The way to place stuff on the screen has slightly changed but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD has the Leap view option: tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. With a press and hold you can rearrange the homescreens as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreens is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense UI offers Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are now selected from a fancy-looking 3D card interface but other than that, their functionality is mostly unchanged. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes from the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch to a list. In the list layout, there?s an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster. It?s similar to what you used to see in TouchFLO on older HTC WinMo phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set, which is a sound theme of sorts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (HTC and Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreens short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. The Twitter widget for instance ? one version shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet, while the other version is more compact but is for tweeting only. There's nothing stopping you from using both, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has seen some renovation ? it now features a list of recent apps, just like a task switcher. A press and hold on the Home button works too. Maybe some people will use the notification area as the easier way to switch apps, but we would have preferred some quick switches for Wi-Fi, GPS, etc. rather than duplicated functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z managed to beat the original Desire thanks to the newer Android (2.2 vs. 2.1) despite the lower clock speed (800MHz vs. 1GHz). The HTC Desire HD runs at full 1GHz speed and it scales as expected ? the performance increase is proportional to the clock speed increase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing ? the Desire is powered by a QSD8250 Snapdragon while the Desire HD uses the newer QSD8255, which is manufactured using a 45nm process (vs. 65nm of the old). This should result in a small improvement in the battery performance, but it seems that it?s too small compared to the power draw of the huge screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and the magically fast boot-up is part of the Desire HD package ? watch the end of video at the top of the page and you?ll see just how fast it is. Note that if you take out the battery, the Desire HD will have to do the regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s annoying that when you press down the power key, the phone won?t start booting until you?ve released the key, which is quite misleading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC has used some sort of Suspend or Hibernate logic as we know them from regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook loves to socialize<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD features HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with heavy social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just he first tab ? the other tabs hold other categories of info and communication methods, like emails or a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it used conversation style view, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what really turn the Desire HD into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your friends? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of each essential field but you can easily add more fields, including other fields in case you want to write down every last scrap of info you have on a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull out your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Desire HD. The Transfer Data app supports many phones from major manufacturers and pulls the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has many features, including Smart Dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound quality of the HTC Desire HD is crisp and loud and the signal reception was strong and trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD has Smart Dialing. Voice dialing is here too ? just press and hold the search key and say, for example, ?Call Dexter?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphabet scroll is an alternative as well and has an interesting change: it puts the Recent calls and Favorite contacts just before the contacts starting with A. This has consequences on contact ordering ? if you?ve recently called Dexter, he won?t show up under ?D?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm. You can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down ? if you do that during a call, the phone will switch into loudspeaker mode instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature that works thanks to the accelerometer is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call). Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy app is the Blocked Callers app ? it lets you block certain callers (you can pick from the recent call list or the phonebook) and remove blocked callers from the list. It?s a simple but potentially very useful utility ? some Nokia Eseries phones have a similar app, though it has more options (e.g. redirects, only blocked during certain hours, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very handy feature is that when someone calls, their latest Tweet or Facebook update will show up ? possibly reminding you what the caller has been up to or is after. We can see how that can be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Desire HD fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging powerhouse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is well equipped for all kinds of text messaging ? it can handle all standard types of messages like SMS, MMS and email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Android phones, if you only have one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the messaging menu is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages use the threaded layout ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the time of the last message, including a part of the actual note. Tapping a conversation brings up another list ? the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses contact photos too (yours and the contact?s photo), so the whole thing looks almost the same as a chat app. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is big ? especially in landscape mode where it takes half the screen. Composing messages is much more comfortable than on the Desire Z where you get a two-line text box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection has become very iPhone-like ? and that?s a compliment. When you press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements. Text selection works the same way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input method that the HD offers is an on-screen QWERTY. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the big screen automatically means bigger, well-spaced keys, which are very easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going landscape makes things even bigger. The keyboard does limit the screen-space dedicated to typing (unlike the Desire Z, which left the entire screen open for text), but again, this isn?t much of a problem as the Desire HD has plenty of room to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email has combined inbox<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app, which looks the same as usual, and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, there are several tabs that can filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand (they are not automatically loaded by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Desire HD lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery can read pics over DLNA too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a figure indicating the number of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, one for Flickr. These two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Connected media button lets you pull multimedia content from a DLNA-enabled server (your PC with Windows Media Player will do just fine).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo from the HTC Desire HD is very easy ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. Direct posting of videos on YouTube is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Desire HD image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip layout (flip the phone horizontally and the accelerometer will take care of the rest). You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire HD supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does DivX/XviD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed from the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. The video files can be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface on the HTC Desire HD is quite basic. There?s a full screen mode, where the clip gets stretched / cropped to fit the screen and you can scrub through the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player did well to handle most videos we tested - 720p MP4 videos were no problem. Surprisingly however, high-res DivX/XviD videos were. D1 DivX/XviD videos at reasonable bitrate played just fine and we did get a 720p XviD going, but there were sound and playback issues. It's strange because we didn't experience these problems with the Desire Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, most DivX/XviD videos should play just fine (HD DivX/XviD videos are rare) and even if you?re not a fan of watching movies on a mobile phone, the big screen of the HTC Desire HD will make you reconsider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t support subtitles though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has Dolby Mobile, SRS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Songs and Connected media (which handles DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs or go back. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD has a couple of technologies to boost the audio performance ? Dolby Mobile and SRS enhancement. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too. With these settings at hand, everyone should be able to find the sound they prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. From the context menu, you can share a song (over Bluetooth, email or message) and you can look up the music video too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily recognizes a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free version however limits you to just 5 recognitions per month.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS, but starts slowly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a bit annoying that it takes 5-6 seconds to start but other than that the radio app is very good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We aren't particularly impressed with the HTC Desire HD audio output. When you plug it in an active external amplifier (such as your home or car stereo) it does pretty decently, save for the below average intermodulation distortion. It may not be perfect but it certainly is good enough on those occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet plugging in a pair of headphones, the stereo crosstalk skyrockets and it's almost as bad as if you had a mono device - much like with Optimus 7. The intermodulation distortion increases even further and the handset is not particularly loud too. All in all a mediocre performance and we really expect much better for that kind of cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera has its highs and lows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD packs a camera with specs to match the best the Android world has to offer. It snaps 8MP stills with resolution 3264x2448 pixels and 720p@25fps video and there?s a dual-LED flash / video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is novel and has some fun options. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom slider on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD features touch focus and face detection; geo-tagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus, which automatically adjusts the focus when you move the phone. This is very useful, since the Desire HD doesn?t really have a hardware shutter key to trigger the autofocus (you can?t do that with the virtual shutter key either). This way you just point the camera in the direction you want and take the photo ? the HD will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other kinds of effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera supports face detection too. It?s enabled in self-portrait mode too ? you can set it to focus on 1 or 2 faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Desire HD unit (an off-the-shelf phone) did have an obvious lens issue, which smudges the left side of the photos. This issue aside, the amount of captured detail is decent and the noise reduction algorithms are well-tuned but there are some visible artifacts resulting from the aggressive sharpening stage (oversharpened noise).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without the lens issues, the Desire HD camera wouldn?t rank among the top 8MP Android shooters (or 8MP cameras in general).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can judge the camera by the samples below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Desire HD. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive HD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the previous HTC phones tagged ?HD?, the Desire HD actually shoots HD video this time around ? though we?re guessing that?s not what has been behind the HD moniker in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the Desire HD had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reality of image quality however is hardly flattering. The videos are recorded as 3GP files (not the best option) and the results are actually slightly worse than what the Desire Z put up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are noise and compression artifacts visible (especially in the sky) and what seems to be the fingerprints of image interpolation. The frame rate wasn?t smooth either ? there?s a noticeable stutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reality is much less impressive than the specs look on paper ? we were rather disappointed. Here goes a sample 720p@25fps video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well-geared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is a connectivity master. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is a given, and the dual-band 3G is blazing fast ? 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in the microUSB cable you?re presented with a long list of options. The basics are Charge only, Disk drive (connects the microSD card as a mass storage drive) and HTC Sync for connecting to HTC?s PC suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more options however ? USB tethering, which shares the phone?s data connection (and that fast HSPA makes it a great modem for a laptop), while the other option ? Internet pass-through ? does just the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot ? Android 2.2 Froyo has Wi-Fi tethering built-in, but this app is actually more powerful. It can connect 1 to 8 devices (default app maxes out at 5) and you can set the maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can encrypt the hotspot with WEP, WPA or WPA2 and you can enable only ?allowed users? to connect or leave it open for anything (unsecure, but the quickest setup). You can set the app to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery if you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great Flash-enabled web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid web browsing has been an inherent part of the Android deal since day one. And version 2.2 Froyo is the fastest yet ? and then there?s the Flash 10.1 capability, which really opens up the Web (which for better or for worse still relies heavily on Flash for video streaming and navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the refresh button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This leaves the entire screen to the web page ? and what a screen. It surely isn?t the first of its kind but the 4.3? WVGA screen gets as close as you can possibly get to desktop-level browsing on a mobile phone. A 5? tablet does fare a little better, but you?d never be able to put it in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire HD browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which make it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out yet more options ? anything from finding on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to further sweeten the deal, HTC Desire HD has Flash support in its web browser. YouTube videos played quite smoothly so we decided to try out a few games from the mobile section of Kongregate. Quite a few Flash games worked very well in the browser (and are optimized for touch control).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say what you will about Flash, but still most video streaming and game sites use it ? so it?s a major advantage for a browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.2 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A fine organizer on board, office doc editor included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are on board the HTC Desire HD but it does one better than most other phones ? it?s got a mobile Office app that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the Quickoffice app, which has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The faster CPU (compared to the Desire Z) does give it an edge in speed. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out (using pinch zoom of course) you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a Word document, you get plenty of formatting options (more than you get on Windows Phone 7). You get text effects (italic, bold, etc.), you can change the font and its size, color and highlight (from a color picker, not just 3 pre-selected colors like in WP7).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when you tap Format you get a long list with all the options in it ? usable but not quite user friendly. You can?t create tables or lists either. The situation with spreadsheets is similar ? enough features, but not presented in the most user-friendly way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Desire HD into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which allow you to update your profiles on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also came preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (both are very good, so whichever one you choose will do fine). They integrate with the phonebook, so you can read your friends? tweets from there, no need to launch the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two handy search apps Quick lookup and Search Anywhere. Quick lookup lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary. The Search Anywhere app is a universal in-phone search that covers anything ? from settings and messages to songs and videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The eBook reader puts a virtual library in your pocket<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Reader app is an eBook reader provided by Kobo. It comes preloaded with several classics (from A Tale of Two Cities to White Fang) and access to Kobo?s eBook store where you can buy new books (the store includes more free titles too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is fairly simple ? it presents a cover flow like list of all and once you tap a cover, it opens up the book for you (with a nice animation). Alternatively, you can view your library as a list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reader formats the book to best fit the screen and you can change the font setting if it?s too small (or too big). You can add bookmarks, highlight sections of the book with different colors and even jot down notes ? you can access those later from the context menu while reading the book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish there were more settings though ? colors, backlight control, etc. The background is pure white, which means it glows with the full strength of the backlight, which quickly becomes a problem and tires your eyes. A choice of background colors would have been nice and some easy to reach control of the backlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we missed is the option to import books you already have ? like classic books from Project Guttenberg for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, some will find the Reader app useful, others can just grab Kindle for Android from the Market or one of the other free eBook readers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is running the latest available version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the rest of the apps, you can scroll down. To make discovering apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market, but each one comes with an HTC review. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Desire HD contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Desire HD in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy (we tried it in Firefox 3.6.12), so if you?re stuck with Internet Explorer it will feel sluggish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation gets some help from TomTom, Route66<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a little over a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But HTC recently made an interesting announcement ? the Desire HD and the Desire Z will come with HTC Places, collaboration with TomTom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What HTC Locations can do is let you download maps for countries for free, or just cache maps as you browse. Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you stray from your course and don?t have a data connection Gmaps can?t do anything, which might be a problem. No such problems with Locations though ? that distinction makes all the difference when traveling abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing we found interesting ? when HTC announced Locations, they said they were collaborating with TomTom. But when we started the app we saw Route66 flash on the screen ? it turns out the software is by Route66, while TomTom contributed the maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The car panel offers big, easy to hit buttons so that you don?t get too distracted while driving. A handy option is ?mark this location? ? great for those who often forget where they parked their car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you take the plunge and pay extra for the voice-guided navigation, the HTC Desire HD can very successfully double s a SatNav unit. A lot of dedicated units have 4.3?-5? screens, so the Desire HD isn?t really at a disadvantage here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD is not in the mood to fool around ? it has to be the biggest screen, the fastest processor, the latest software on the block.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s easy to pick the best available ingredients ? but making them work in a slim and solid package like the Desire HD is what separates the wannabes from the champions. And HTC did a great job ? the HD is almost exactly the size of a Samsung Galaxy S despite the 0.3? lead in screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having mentioned it, the Samsung Galaxy S already has a solid market headstart and a Froyo release. Its screen may be 0.3-inches smaller, but it?s definitely superior. The TouchWiz is not the best custom UI but sure gets the job done. The Galaxy S costs at least 120 euro less than the Desire HD, which along with the Super AMOLED screen and the better HD videos is a serious advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Eclair-running Droids, we find the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. We?re talking big high-res screens, 8 megapixel still cameras with HD recording and custom user interface plug-ins. Both phones fetch a much lower price than the Desire HD, but neither is likely to get a Froyo upgrade any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola MILESTONE XT720 ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no way we can miss the Apple iPhone 4 or the Nokia N8. In this price bracket, it?s mostly flagship phones the Desire HD will be dealing with. So, if budget is of no concern, the iPhone-grade touchscreen experience and Retina display are well worth your time and money. So is probably the best cameraphone you can get these days ? the Nokia N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPhone 4 ? Nokia N8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you might want to give Microsoft a second chance. If that?s the case, there?re quite a few Windows Phone 7 alternatives. HTC have the HD7 ? almost the same specs as the Desire HD with nearly the same price tag. Another excellent offer is the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? a 4-inch Super AMOLED display being its most prominent feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC HD7 ? Samsung I8700 Omnia 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of the phones listed above, the HTC Desire HD is for those looking for the ultimate gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re dealing with a true heavyweight here. This phone is hard to beat, whether it?s hardware or software. It takes SuperAMOLED or Retina to actually challenge the massive screen. Froyo has brought a major performance boost too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty, its camera performance is less than stellar, and so is the audio reproduction quality, but there are other things that make the phone so desirable. One of them is the updated Sense UI with a host of remote services. There?s also the unibody design and the impressive connectivity package. Not least, it?s the massive screen matched to a slim profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fear the 4.3 inches worth of screen might too big for your hand or pocket or think that 768MB of RAM is a bit of an overkill, you should definitely try the phone out before shelling out the cash. If you find out you like it, or if you have your heart set on getting the a top feature package, then the HTC Desire HD is one of the handful phones that fit the job description and definitely deserves serious consideration.</paragraph>
