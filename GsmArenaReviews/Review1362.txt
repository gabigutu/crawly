			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mobile gaming is at an all-time high thanks to big-screen touch smartphones. But it was when the Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY was announced that gamers hearts went aflutter. The PlayStation phone has been rumored ever since Sony joined Ericsson and now it?s finally as real as it gets - and it?s in our hands at last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY is half phone, half portable game console ? Android all the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What sets the PLAY apart from other phones on the market are the dedicated game controls ? they are pretty much the same controls you?ll find on a PSP Go or a PlayStation DualShock controller. And there?s the 4? touchscreen of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How can it get better than that? A catalog of PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games for one (though we?ll have to wait a while for the PS2 games). When the Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY launches, there should be about 50 optimized games in its Playstation Pocket game store. Not a bad startup catalog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The PlayStation Pocket game store will be filled with content from Sony Computer Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Gameloft, Namco and others and will be your go-to place for getting new games. The PLAY comes with six games pre-installed to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming is central to the XPERIA PLAY but it doesn?t eclipse the Android smartphone. A 4? FWVGA (480x854) touchscreen, a 1GHz CPU and Android 2.3 Gingerbread allow the PLAY to handle day-to-day smartphone tasks with ease.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY stands at 119 x 62 x 16mm ? smaller than its PSP Go counterpart despite the bigger screen (the PLAY has a 4? screen vs. the 3.8 inches of the Go).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs a hefty 175 grams, but they?re not a burden in two-handed gameplay. The back of the PLAY is curved and quite comfortable to hold, plus, the curves do manage to conceal some of the thickness. But make no mistake, it is a big and heavy phone ? even too much for single-hand everyday use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display and dedicated gaming controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY has a 4? 16M-color LCD screen of FWVGA (480 x 854) resolution. It?s not what Sony Ericsson calls a Reality display and there?s no Bravia Engine there either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the screen is good when you?re looking at it head on. It?s not very bright even at the brightest setting but the contrast and color rendering are very good. Things deteriorate when you tilt the screen at an angle but not too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text on the screen remains visible but contrast degrades rather fast (gradients appear as a solid color) and colors get vastly distorted. Make not it?s an unpleasant effect that you don?t get with the IPS matrix of the iPhone 4 or with currently the best AMOLED technologies (ClearBlack and SuperAMOLED).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gaming control deck pulls out smoothly thanks to the spring-assisted slider. There?s no sign of wobble even when the slider is fully open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The deck hosts a set of dedicated gaming buttons modeled after the DualShock controller for the PlayStation console.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four types of controls: the directional keys are on the left and the action keys on the right (marked with a triangle, circle, X and a square). They are placed inside an inset circle and are very tactile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L and R trigger keys are on the right-hand side of the phone: they fall right under your forefingers behind the screen in game mode. They are big, perfectly positioned and overall very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third type of control is the analog touch pad ? there are two of them and they replace the analog sticks of a DualShock controller. Those aren?t all that big and you might not get all the precision you want out of them, especially if you have big fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there are the standard game control keys ? Start and Select, along with a handy Menu key (which is shortcut to the game settings). These keys are small and out of the way, so you won?t hit them accidentally during play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY is not a small phone, or especially thin but when it comes to playing games this bulk is actually a good thing. It allows you to get a stable grip on the phone, which gets pretty big when slid open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A solid grip is vital to a good gaming experience, especially since you have your index fingers and thumbs moving around quickly on the control deck and behind the screen on the shoulder keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the XPERIA PLAY is not too comfortable to hold in one hand and use as a phone but it?s got an excellent feel when held in both hands.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY shares some common design elements with the Neo and the Pro ? sloping top and bottom and human curvature shape at the back. The PLAY will be available in Black or White ? we have the black version to preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen we have the standard set of Android keys: Back, Home, Menu and Search. The controls are rather narrow but solid to press. Telling them apart may be difficult though and you might occasionally hit the wrong one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty crowded above the screen: you?ll find a proximity sensor, the earpiece and the video-call camera. Unfortunately, there?s no ambient light sensor to automatically adjust the screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY is busier that usual. There?s the volume rocker in the middle, which is pretty tiny and not all that comfortable to use. The two shoulder trigger keys are there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the PLAY, there?s the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port, both of which are exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is on top with a charging LED on the key itself. The key is pretty small as usual and accidental key presses are impossible. The bottom features just the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is at the back of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY with the LED flash right next to it. The secondary microphone is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo speakers are at the back as well ? right on the slanting edge to make sure the sound doesn?t get muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover, though not beneath the battery itself and is therefore hot-swappable. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA PLAY supports 32GB cards and comes with an 8GB microSD card in the box. A clever system detects the back cover being open and automatically unmounts the microSD card. How about that?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is under the 1500mAh battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play has Android Gingerbread inside not without some home-brewed customizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not much different from the Neo and Arc actually. The Mediascape add-on is out of the equation and the phone uses the vanilla Android. The proprietary Timescape UI is still here though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve got a video to demonstrate the XPERIA Play UI. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson obviously tried to put their stamp on the stock Android Gingerbread but overall the interface hasn?t been dramatically changed, just polished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen Overview lets you pinch zoom out of any of the 5 homescreen panes to a new screen. It?s an aggregate view of all your active widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four docked shortcuts (two either side of the launcher key). They are visible on all 5 home screens and can be edited: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is very easy and intuitive. All you need to do is drag an icon over another and you?re prompted to choose a name and layout for your new folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of static and live wallpapers to choose from. To set wallpaper you hit the menu button and select the Wallpaper icon. You then get to choose between Gallery images, Live wallpapers and custom Sony Ericsson wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a widget on the homescreen is no rocket science, either. You just hold your finger on an empty spot on the screen to open the add-to-homescreen popup. It lets you add shortcuts, widget or folders, as well as set a wallpaper image. Alternatively, you can just hit the menu button and then select ?add?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is a trademark Android feature. The pull-down notification bar displays recent events, as well as running apps. Holding down the Home button launches the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface. Gingerbread really takes things to a whole new level by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to benchmarks, we?d advise you to take the results with a pinch of salt. Our XPERIA Play unit is a pre-release unit and may not really be combat ready. You?ll notice that in some ways it performs worse than the XPERIA Neo, which should change once we have a proper finalized product. On Quadrant, the XPERIA Play got 1623 points which is a little better than the Neo?s 1441.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general feel of the phone is fluid and fast. There were no hiccups with the XPERIA Play. Credit goes to the Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon 1GHz chipset. The amount of user available RAM is 380MB (from 512MB of total RAM).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player interface on the XPERIA Play is very similar to the music section of the discarded Mediascape app. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers all the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key, which lets you quickly look up a song or album on YouTube or Sony Ericsson?s own Play Now arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Play has a rich selection of equalizer presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play has a 5 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED flash. It produces images of 2592&#x445;1944 resolution and offers image stabilization and geotagging (thanks to the built-in GPS receiver). It?s supposed to have touch focus as well, but our prototype seems to lack that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no dedicated shutter key on the XPERIA Play ? the space is used up by the trigger keys and ? disappointing enough ? none of them can be used as a shutter key. Some other gaming controls work in camera mode though. The X button serves as a shutter key and the O button is a back key. The menu key brings up the relevant options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main set of options is limited to focusing mode, exposure, scene mode, color effect and picture size. ISO, for example isn?t among the available user-configurable options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of picture quality, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play does well even at this pre-release stage. Images have a good level of detail, with pleasing colors and reasonably low levels of noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play does WVGA video at 30 fps. In any other device in this segment this would?ve been a disappointment but the XPERIA Play is in a different line of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution aside, the XPERIA Play videos are smooth enough, with good colors.The video camera interface repeats the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample taken straight from the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser supports Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play browser is right there on top with the best of them. It is the latest version, due to the 2.3.2 software, and supports Flash to give you the downsized, but full web-browsing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is minimalist. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web pages take full advantage of the high-resolution 4-inch display of the XPERIA Play. There are three supported zooming options ? double tap, pinch-to-zoom and the virtual ?- +? buttons at the bottom right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play at the games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is what the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is really all about. The other stuff is just a front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just pop open the slide-out gamepad and there?ll be no doubts left. Sliding the phone up launches the Games menu and ? if you?re the right user of this phone ? that?s the place you want to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play unit has 6 preinstalled games, but there will be many more to come from the Android Market or the PlayStation pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first game we played is Crash Bandicoot. Being an original Playstation 1 title, it?s displayed in the PlayStation widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This game makes use of all of the hardware controls and is a good way to get a taste of the promised PlayStation experience on the XPERIA Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next title is Bruce Lee: Dragon Warrior, probably an XPERIA Play-exclusive game, which we couldn?t find at the Android Market. This game however is also available for Bada OS and iOS (including an HD version for the iPad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Star Battalion you are a space craft pilot on missions against land and air targets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sports genre is represented by FIFA 10. Having played it on the iPhone and Android handsets, comparison is overwhelmingly in the XPERIA Play?s favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sims 3, Guns?n?Glory and Tetris are also on the menu on the EXPERIA Play. But if the available Android or Playstation titles are not enough you have yet another option ? an emulator for Nintendo, Super Nintendo and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested a SNES emulator on our XPERIA Play and we were surprised to find that you can actually use all the gamepad keys to play. All you need to do is set up the keyboard input options and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SNES ROMs count on the internet is huge so you?re not without choices. Unfortunately, we?ve just heard that the PlayStation emulator has just been removed by Google from the Android Market. We hope the rest of the emulators there don?t suffer the same fate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PlayStation Pocket will be the real deal though ? when it?s operational. Upon launch, Sony Ericsson claims there will be about 50 games available for the XPERIA Play. Those will be PlayStation titles exclusive to the XPERIA Play and we think this could be a key feature to this device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play delivers on the promise of a whole new experience of mobile phone gaming. That?s mostly due to the non-existent competition but ? to give credit where it?s due ? the XPERIA Play takes its stuff seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing bothering us is the hardware. We can?t help but wonder what a dual-core processor and better graphics chip could?ve done for the quality of the games that are yet to come out for the platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we?ve seen recently with the NVIDIA Tegra Zone, games made for Android will just keep getting better. They?ll outclass PlayStation 1 sooner rather than later. But if Sony Ericsson keep up the level of commitment, the XPERIA Play will be less important as a phone and more as an evolving project.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is ahead of the current competition. Users who are not particularly fond of touchscreen gaming will embrace it as the ultimate device. The gamepad makes a massive difference indeed and will be a key selling point. Much will depend on the amount of exclusive content too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Android part of the story, it seems we?ll have to wait for the full review to pass judgment. Sounds unfair ? but a well built and Gingerbread-powered full-featured smartphone is put in the shade. That?s not an easy thing to do though ? it takes something as big as a proper gamepad.</paragraph>
