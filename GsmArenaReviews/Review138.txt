			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's re-invention has gone into season 2 with the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. They ramp up the camera to a whole new level, make the display Always On and retool the other features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S7 edge hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year "edge" means "big." Not S6 edge+ big, but the 5.5" curved Super AMOLED screen puts the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge above the regular S6 (and S7).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen features an Always-On function, which is said to draw 1% battery charge per hour. Besides the time and date, the screen shows a subtle wallpaper to make things a little fancier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front and back of the S7 edge are covered by tough glass. Both panes have been 3D thermo-formed, a process unique to Samsung. Also, the new design includes a camera that protrudes less than half a millimeter from the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera sets a mobile record with its f/1.7 aperture. It also has extra-large (but not the largest ever) 1.4µm pixels on its new 12MP sensor. Samsung had a low-light test setup and the Galaxy S7 edge wiped the floor with the S6 edge+ on imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was an easy win too, the camera sensor now picks up 56% more light thanks to the larger pixels, another 25% courtesy of the brighter aperture. Multiply one by the other and you realize the Galaxy S7 has 95% more light to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image sensor features Dual Pixel focusing - similar to Phase Detection autofocus, but Samsung claims it's four times faster. And it is, we tested that too and it ran circles around the iPhone 6s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is water resistant too, IP68-certified. We got a chance to personally dunk a unit and it came out just fine. Unlike the Xperias, though, the touchscreen does not work when wet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you read this far looking for "microSD" with anxiety, we're pleased to report the microSD slot is back. On some models this will be a hybrid slot, accepting a second SIM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Galaxy S7 we are instantly reminded of the S6 (which we brought along for comparison purposes). The two look quite similar in photos, but in person, they are much easier to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7 is slightly thicker but doesn't feel like it, because its back is now beveled like the Note5. This makes it more comfortable in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Black color option looks amazing until your fingers get it all greased up. The White paint job is the most resistant to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung will use both Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890 for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. Performance between the two chipsets has been balanced out and should be 30% faster in CPU terms, 60% faster for the GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has the same Always On feature as the S7 edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Same goes for the camera - large 1.4µm pixels paired with a bright f/1.7 aperture. The nearly-flush camera looks much better than the S6 hump, it can almost pass for a design accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7 pair features wireless charging, supporting both the Qi and PMA standards. There's a microUSB 2.0 port on the bottom, Samsung sticking to the tried-and-true standard (still bitter from the USB 3.0 experience?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a closer look at the card tray. The two cards are parked in a line, instead of going side-to-side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 design has only seen subtle changes since the S6, but these small differences add up to a much more polished experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We tested both the S7 and S7 edge and the difference in form factor didn't make a difference in performance, so we united their scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this is the Exynos 8890 chipset, which is built on a 14nm process and features a total of eight custom Samsung cores - four small and four big ones. They work together with Mali-T880 GPU to deliver awesome performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 6 shows a sufficient gain in performance over the old guard, the S6 edge+.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung moved away from the stock ARM Cortex cores, but comparing them to the Huawei Mate 8 (Kirin 950, 4x A72 + 4x A53) the two seem on par (we don't have single-core scores for the Mate 8 though).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU proved strong at a fixed 1080p resolution, games can even run at native QHD resolution if they keep effects at a sane setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium seems to top the Galaxy S7 in onscreen tests despite its 4K screen, but that's only because it runs most apps at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: we had a wrong, low score for the Galaxy S7 on GFX 3.0 Manhattan (offscreen). This has been corrected.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Lens case hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lens case is an official Samsung external lens accessory for the Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge have been official for a few hours now and one rather prevailing opinion that we have been hearing about the pair is that for some they lack dramatic upgrade or significant innovation over the Galaxy S6 line. This, of course, is not to say that the S7 is bad, but some people appear to be finding it a bit predictable, which we can somewhat understand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, we feel obliged to give credit where credit is due. Despite the lack of any flashy, out-there new concepts, like, let's say, a sliding battery and hardware expansion modules, the Galaxy S7 is still big on technical innovation an improvement, but you do have to dig a little deeper to properly appreciate them. One area that has seen major improvement is the camera. Samsung has put a lot of effort into it and especially the Dual Pixel auto focus technology so that it can claim a top spot in the mobile imaging food chain. Shots are now brighter, and the whole module is significantly smaller, reducing the dreaded camera bump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't dive any further into Samsung's revolutionary camera tech, as we already did so in this dedicated article, which we encourage you to check out. What we will be showing you, however, is an interesting accessory that the Korean giant has designed as a metaphoric cherry to go on top of the cake that is the S7 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the Samsung Lens case. It is designed specifically for the Galaxy S7 and does exactly what you would imagine - adds a lens on top of the aforementioned camera. The idea of an accessory lens is not new but unlike other after-market solutions, the Samsung Lens case has the benefit of being tailor-made for the handsets, which is the only way to ensure a proper experience and quality results. Optics are not to be tinkered with lightly, as most photographers and engineers will attest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of lenses, the case will initially be available with two interchangeable options. One is a telephoto for long-distance shots, and the other is a wide-angle model for a wider field of view. The key thing to note is that they are interchangeable and feature a screw-in design, which, of course, means that more variants might come in the future. The lenses themselves, just like the aforementioned screw mechanism, look extremely well built and finely crafted. The same goes for the case part of the device, which snaps in place on the back on the phone and has a pleasant leather-like texture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for actual results when using the Lens case, conditions on the show floor were far from ideal for a demonstration, but we did manage to snap a couple of stills. The fist is a wide-angle one and the second - the telephoto. We'll let you judge for yourself.</paragraph>
