			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you?re shopping on a budget, getting the most bang for your buck is what counts. And the Nokia X2 is keen to give you an exchange rate that?s hard to beat. This no-nonsense bar delivers a 5MP camera with flash, great audio with stereo speakers, dedicated music keys and a built-in antenna for the FM receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Features like that can run up quite a bill at checkout ? but not with the Nokia X2. Its price hovers around the 100 euro mark ? a bargain for that feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that there weren?t compromises made ? here?s the rundown of what made the cut and what was scrapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 is a lower midrange S40 phone and it shows when you look at the disadvantages. But most of those are under the hood and you likely won?t notice them right away. The back cover is made of aluminum and has a brushed metal finish that looks great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo speakers are loud and you don?t need the headphones to blast out that new song on the radio. And if that feels too retro, the microSD card slot is easily accessible. The Nokia X2 is true Xseries stuff and makes no excuses when it comes to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 doesn?t overlook the biggest thing on the Internet since Google either. The dedicated Facebook app is pretty good (by non-touch phones? standards).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the 5MP camera with LED flash came as a bit of a surprise ? that kind of camera usually goes on a mid-to-high end phones. Not all 5MP cameras are born equal though as we?ll see later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we?re getting ahead of ourselves ? we need to open the box first. Jump to the next page to see what?s in and how the Nokia X2 feels on the outside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 comes in a small package with little inside: there?s a compact charger, a one-piece headset and a 2GB microSD card. There?s no USB cable ? this we can understand, microUSB cables are very common and it helps keep the price down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Nokia X2 supports USB On-The-Go and you?d need a convertor from male microUSB to female Type A (like the USB port on your computer) to use that. Now, those aren?t nearly as common. But without one you can?t use USB OTG ? so, we?re guessing that it will remain a relatively unused feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 stands at 111 x 47 x 13.3 mm ? not the smallest phone around, especially considering that the 2.2? screen doesn?t take up much space. Still, the phone weighs just 81 grams and you can barely feel it in your hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 is a low-priced phone but it doesn?t look cheap. The back cover is made of aluminum with brushed metal finish and with the embossed Nokia logo it looks pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 has a modestly sized 2.2? QVGA display. It?s bright with decent contrast (not the best we?ve seen on a Nokia phone though). What lets it down is its poor side viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is sub-par too ? obviously Nokia has cut corners with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the traditional arrangement of S40 buttons ? a D-pad, two soft keys and two call keys. A reasonably sized D-pad dominates the flat layout. The call and soft keys feel just a bit squeezed up but still OK to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the 12-key alphanumeric keypad. It?s the flatbed type but does have some bordering between keys on different rows and columns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are big enough but they are hard to press and with short stroke (the same goes for the call and soft keys). That?s a bit of a typing speed bump ? the X2 is not a texter?s phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three dedicated music keys on the left are the most prominent feature on the X2. They are big and easy to use and they can control both the music player and the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the volume rocker, the microSD port hidden under a protective flap and the shutter key. The bottom of the phone is where the lanyard eyelet is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three connection points at the top of the phone. The 3.5mm audio jack is on the left, the 2mm charger plug in the middle and the microUSB port (under its plastic cover) is on the right. The microUSB port is enabled for charging and handles USB On-The-Go too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port proved a little too wide, which let the cable wobble. Often we?d plug in the cable but the phone wouldn?t start charging. If you?re not careful, the Nokia X2 might run out of juice, even though you thought you charged it all night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the back cover on the Nokia X2 is made of aluminum, but that?s not all that?s interesting about the back. The fixed-focus 5MP camera and LED flash are here and there?s a latch for opening the cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are stereo speakers on the back ? one grill is on top, the other is at the bottom. The grills are split in two, but that?s for decorative purposes only. The top speaker is under the left half of the grill and the bottom one is under the right half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the X2 has a slight curve to it, so the speakers don?t get completely muffled when you put the phone down on a flat surface. There?s some distortion of the sound though (not entirely unexpected).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back panel you can find the 860 mAh Li-Ion BL-4C battery, which powers the Nokia X2. The battery is quoted at up to 624 hours of stand-by, up to 13 hours and 30 minutes of talk-time and up to 27 hours of music playback. Many users however report they?re only getting around 5 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum cover brings a little class to the Nokia X2, which is otherwise all plastic. The build quality is very good ? except for the wobbly USB port ? and the ergonomics are alright too. The keys are big enough even though it?s obviously not the best keyboard for texting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tapered corners shave off some of that 13.3mm of thickness, at least that?s how the X2 feels in the hand. The phone is rather tall, but other than that it?s easily pocketable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? more of the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 is powered by the Series 40 6th edition software ? it should be familiar to everyone now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vast reach of Nokia means that many people have at some point used an S40 device. But old glory aside, S40 still has important features missing and things that need polishing ? even in the 6th edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, familiarity is not a bad thing. Plus, the UI is simple and fairly intuitive so you can get going right away, you don?t need special tips to use the Nokia X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is available as usual. It divides the screen in four sections that can be scrolled with the D-pad and edited as users see fit. By default, the clock is on top, then the music and radio player and the Shortcut bar, which grants instant access to favorite functions and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course customize that ? rearrange things and add or replace things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature is that pressing the end key while the keypad is locked brings up a clock that shows the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the usual 6th edition views ? Grid, Grid with labels, List and Single (which displays one icon at a time, like S30).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there?s no multitasking support ? if you?re running, say, Opera Mini you can?t read an incoming SMS or use most other features of the phone. Thanks to the dedicated music keys you can at least change the track (or radio station) and if there?s an incoming call, the app will be paused while you take it. You can?t make outgoing calls until you exit the app though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video of some of general features of the Nokia X2, including the dedicated Facebook app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Regular phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia X2 will store up to 2000 contacts, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for 99% of the users out there. You can set the phonebook to display contacts from the phone memory, SIM memory or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple and straightforward ? the phone asks for number, first and last name and that?s it. When you need to add other details you can always go back and edit the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. You can assign ringtones to each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The signal reception on the Nokia X2 was good, though not the best we?ve had. The in-call sound was crisp and clear though not very loud even at the highest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no smart dialing on the X2 ? not surprising for an S40 device. There?s no voice dialing either, nor the Voice Clarity sound enhancement many other S40 phones have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out the Nokia X2 is an Excellent performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is certainly up to the task. The Nokia X2 is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS, as well as flash and audio messages and there?s easy email handling too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the X2 is not the heavy texter kind. Other than that, there?s nothing missing ? Conversations is here too (that?s the threaded message feature). Actually, Conversations replaces the regular Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around. You type your message (there?s a character counter and message part counter available) and when you?re done you pick the recipient from the contacts list, the recently used numbers, the call log or contact groups. You can have a favorite contact too (just one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, you can enter the number manually if it?s not on any of those lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password ? the Nokia X2 took care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did have some issues at first ? the Email app had disappeared, but that was probably some bug. We tried flashing the firmware (from V4.25 to V4.80) and the problem was sorted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo gallery and file browser go their separate ways<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 Gallery app used to try being too many things at once and being a photo gallery wasn?t among its strong points. Now, there?s a separate icon in the main menu ? Photos, which serves the one and only purpose of viewing the photos and videos on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality is pretty much the same, but at least the Photo gallery gets rid of the cruft of file managing features and leaves only the image-related stuff in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia X2 offers only a single viewing mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. You can switch to landscape mode from the menu though ? it makes better use of the screen real estate when you open a photo (there are black bars in portrait mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in on a single picture is pretty comfortable with the zoom in and out shortcuts placed on the middle and right soft keys. It?s also fast and relatively smooth, even for 5MP images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline (they are ordered by the date they were taken) and of course you can set up a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it?s still here ? but it?s hidden in the Applications menu. It?s quite a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files ? both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia X2 has decent looks and a solid set of features. It has great all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled either via the dedicated touch keys or the D-pad. Songs can be filtered by artist, album and genre. The player handles AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be enabled in the Homescreen mode settings for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has an equalizer with presets and two customizable settings along with Stereo widening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Nokia X2 has another feature to enhance its music performance besides the dedicated keys ? the stereo speakers. They are set wide apart and are quite loud ? no portable speakers needed with the X2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS and built-in antenna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on X2 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions. The great thing here is that it has a very sensitive built-in antenna ? no need to plug in the headphones for the radio to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is pretty basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike music playback, video is not the Nokia X2?s strong suit ? the small, low-res, 4:3 screen rules out regular use as a dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not uncommon for feature phones to include DivX/XviD support, but the X2 supports only MP4 and 3GP. Those are good enough for casual viewing, we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, fast-forwarded or rewound and that?s that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are reports of the X2 hanging during video playback ? we couldn?t replicate it, but judging by the number of complaints it?s a relatively common problem. Nokia?s R&amp;D department is working on the problem, which is reportedly related to some memory cards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia X2 is one of the quieter phones we have recorded in our audio quality test. However it makes up for that with rather clean output both with and without headphones attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is great on both occasions perfect and so are the noise level and the dynamic range. Distortions are well kept under control and despite the stereo crosstalk increasing when headphones come into play, it still remains perfectly tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sub-par fixed-focus 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 boasts an impressive sounding (for a low end phone) 5 megapixel camera with LED flash ? but there?s no autofocus. The maximum image resolution is 2592x1944 pixels. The LED flash doubles as a torch and is quite good at it ? but as an actual photo flash, it?s only good at close range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but we can?t expect more given the price of around 100 euro. The available settings include white balance, various effects and a self timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While impressive as a number, the 5 megapixels of the Nokia X2 camera fail to impress. We know better than to ride a phone that tries to offer so much for so little price, but the camera is a showcase of various imaging problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sometimes, photos ended up as .NRW (?Nokia RAW?, not Nikon RAW) files when we tried offloading the photos right after they were taken. If that happens, open the gallery and after it?s done updating the photos will be ready to go. This only happens if you try to copy photos immediately after they were taken though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images are very noisy despite the noise reduction applied. On the other hand, compression is way too heavy. These two combined seem to bring down the practical resolution of the X2 camera to way below 5MP. There?s also the obvious oversharpening and nasty purple fringing too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia X2. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things don?t get any better when it comes to video recording. The X2 manages QVGA resolution at 20 fps that only seem good enough for an occasional MMS. But video recording uses a lot of processing power that the X2 can?t afford so that?s understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low-end connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 tries to look like it costs double what it actually does and it works. But it can?t offer much in terms of value added features. You get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is the easiest way to transfer files and charge the phone (you can?t always find a 2mm charger, but microUSB cables are common enough). The easily accessible microSD card can help with bulk data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s it for the connectivity on the Nokia X2 ? no 3G (but no screen or browser for it either), no GPS, no Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini is the browser of choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default browser on the Nokia X2 is Opera Mini 4.2. It?s a tradition for S40 phones, but there?s a new version available, which offers some new goodies ? such as multiple tabs, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into lighter format to the device, with the images compressed. While this somewhat spoils the quality, on a small screen (as most low-power devices that rely on the Mini have) you can't tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in image quality aside, the compression really saves on data charges. For example, GSMArena.com clocks in at about 370KB through Nokia?s S40 browser and just under 70KB through Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This saves on data and more importantly speeds things up ? the Nokia X2 relies on EDGE, so having to download much less data means faster browsing. Opera?s rendering algorithm is very good and there are very rarely any problems with displaying pages correctly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia X2 is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar has month, week, and day modes and five types of events to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter tops the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too. There?s a size converter too, for clothing and shoe sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into sharing images, video and audio files with your buddies straight from your handset have a look at Ovi Share. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is limited, you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser and Opera Mini failed to sign in. Bear in mind that 5 megapixel photos can cost you quite a bit at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search or Bing Search initially, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Searching launches the web browser, which makes this app somewhat useless. Or rather, it would have been if Nokia used Opera Mini 5, which has a handy search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock can tell the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the Facebook app. It?s a pretty capable piece of software ? you can manage your profile and post status updates, but also browse your friends? profiles and photos. There?s even an option to take a photo right in the app and upload it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s missing though is the ability to receive notifications of new messages and status updates ? you can?t run the Facebook app in the background and there?s no panel to put on the Active standby, like there was on the Nokia C3 for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store on S40 works much like on S60 smartphones. Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which shows you the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple - a list with the name and logo for each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a three star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, info on size, reviews by people who have tried it, rating (five stars max), the option to write a review yourself or send the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Many games on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 comes with quite a few games pre-installed. They are full versions, so you can look forward to periods of trying to master the deceptively simple City Bloxx.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Block?d, a version of the popular Bubble Breaker game where you have to bring blocks with matching colors together in order to clear them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Diamond rush it?s Sokoban meets Indiana Jones. Find the hidden treasure and push boulders out of the way, but be careful not to block your route. Rally 3D is a classic racing game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bounce tales is a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob. Brain champ is a collection of simple puzzles - a variant of Simon Says, simple math questions (2 + 4 = ?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>City Bloxx is the well-known block stacking game. Be warned, it's addictive. The Snake III game is a nicely elaborate 3D variant of the legendary Snake game and features interesting graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the end is a Sudoku puzzle game. Its inclusion is no surprise - these puzzles have become very popular. If you're a Sudoku buff, this may very well be the most used feature on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40 phone, the Nokia X2 didn?t have many major disappointments in store. There?s not much to rave about either. The camera was the only really questionable feature, though some of the software issues are off-putting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software problems are fixable with a firmware update but there isn?t much to do about the poor camera module and processing. Of course, given the 100-euro price tag you should be prepared for the small screen and the modest in-box accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still, the excellently performing stereo speakers and the built-in FM antenna perform admirably and audio output on the headphones was very good too. And that?s the core functionality of an Xseries device like the Nokia X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for this music fan, there?s stiff competition with plummeting prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo speakers are fairly rare at such low prices, especially on newer phones. Sony Ericsson have a couple of older Walkmans that might interest you though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W595 has a lower-res camera that is actually a bit better and it goes for around the same kind of cash as the X2. The former top dog, the W980 is a bit pricier but it has 8GB of built-in memory (no memory slot though) and an FM transmitter. Both have stereo speakers, 3G and actual multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson W595 ? Sony Ericsson W980</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is not to be overlooked either. The camera situation is the same as the Sony Ericsson?s ? lower resolution but overall better image quality. It uses a good deal of metal on the chassis and offers Symbian with a 600MHz CPU and GPS with free voice guided navigation (oh, and 3G too). The price is just above that of the Nokia X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia C5 ? Samsung S7350 Ultra s ? LG KM570 Cookie Gig</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7350 Ultra s has gotten surprisingly cheap too. It?s old, yes, but it does have a bigger screen with DivX/XviD support, 3G, GPS and a much better 5MP snapper (with D1 video capture @ 30fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a few extra bucks you can even go touchscreen ? the LG KM570 Cookie Gig offers a better 5MP camera (D1 video @ 30fps and all), 3G, 4GB of built-in memory (and a microSD card slot), a document viewer, multitasking. The screen is 3? big with WQVGA resolution and Dolby Mobile provides its music cred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the three can offer speakers as good as the Nokia X2 though, nor the built-in antenna feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2 offers a lot for its price, though we can?t help but be disappointed with the implementation. Still, if it?s the music player that?s the main feature you?re after, the Nokia X2 delivers a good experience along with a nice design and ergonomics. Just be warned that you might hit a few bumps in the road with the rest of the features.</paragraph>
