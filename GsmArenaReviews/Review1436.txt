			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Big buttons and no questions asked. Believe it or not, that?s what some people still look for in a phone. The LG GD550 Pure is playing it safe ? less tech inside means fewer things to go wrong. This is less a gadget for those who think old-school is cool and more for those who take old-school to mean safe and familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure is not many things but one. A good old-fashioned slider with the right measure of metal on the outside and a great keypad. It likes to keep it short and simple. Not too many fancy acronyms on the spec sheet and a user interface that prides itself on simplicity. We can?t even call it user friendly ? foolproof is more like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We usually like it when a company is trying to do things differently. And we don?t mind an occasional blast from the past. The 3G speeds and imaging aside, the LG GD550 Pure would?ve made perfect sense in 2006. In fact, this phone is easier to define by what it?s not than what it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD-lineup has all sorts of phones ? from basic touchscreen (GD 510 Pop) through the cool Mini to the extravagant Crystal. These are all gadgets that the potential GD550 Pure user will never bother to look at. The GD550 Pure is a far cry too from the BL20 New Chocolate and the Pure is very much a low key version of LG?s sweetly-named handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Uncomplicated, comfortable and grown-up, there isn?t much going on with the LG GD550. It?s happy just being a phone. To make it even easier on the user, LG have put a new interface in it and given the new setup a nice catchy name. Pure says it all really ? slide up and you?re right inside the menu. Phones just don?t get any simpler than that to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we?ll get to that in due time. Now let?s see what the LG GD550 Pure is made of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure retail package is downright low-end. A USB cable, a charger and a one-piece headset is all you get inside the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG GD550 Pure 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure uses the BL20 New Chocolate blueprint and of course the shape, size and feel are pretty much the same. Including the fact that it does get quite tall when slid up. At 105.5 x 51 x 12.4 mm when closed, the phone is by no means small but at the same time is reasonably comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is the generous 2.4? but some people will perhaps frown at the unnecessarily wide bezel. It feels the LG GD550 Pure could?ve easily fit that display in something more similar in size to a Nokia 6600 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs in at 132 grams, which is obviously a bit more than the all-plastic BL20 New Chocolate. The metal backplate does account for much of the extra weight. We?re not going to complain about it anyway. The excellent brushed finish and solid feel of the phone are much appreciated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure does look great, blending maturity and simplicity. The body is imposing but clean of excessive embellishments. There?s no clutter of controls. It?s a fine example of minimalist, traditional design, focusing on clean lines and symmetry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure has a 2.4? display of QVGA resolution. Contrast levels are nothing spectacular but the viewing angles are quite good. Sunlight legibility is excellent too. Overall, the GD550 Pure offers reasonably pleasant viewing but no adjustable screen settings. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample metal-framed D-pad is the main navigation control on the LG GD550 Pure. It has a nice big confirm key and its own backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Between the screen and the D-pad is the pair of soft keys to make your way around the minimalist UI. Both the D-pad and the context keys are pleasantly tactile and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece, which doubles as a loudspeaker, is centrally placed above the the LG GD 550 display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the volume rocker, the camera key and the microUSB port hidden under a plastic cap. The shutter key is well sized and quite responsive with a distinct half press. What we don?t like however is that it won?t power up the camera when the slider is closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is located on the lower deck of the slider while the bottom of the phone is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the LG GD550 Pure features a Ring/Silent switch on the same lines as the iPhone. We were surprised to see such a control on a phone like this. It?s quite handy of course and we are sure a lot of people will appreciate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two things to find at the the top of the phone: a Power key and the battery cover release latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up reveals the standard numberpad with three extra buttons ? Call keys and a Clear key ? the same as on the BL20 New Chocolate. The keys are massive and with great tactile feedback. This certainly is a heavy texter?s keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside, the only thing of note is the 5 megapixel camera lens.There?s no LED flash, but we have to admit we?ve seen a pre-production version with LED flash but we?re not quite sure if it will make it to mass market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the rear cover is a 900 mAh Li-Ion BL-4U battery powering the LG GD550 Pure. The battery is quoted at up to 320 hours of stand-by or up to 5 hours and 30 minutes of talk-time. Those are pretty good numbers and real life performance backs them up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM compartment and the microSD card slot are also here. The memory card is hot swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure has lots of metal on its body and the build quality is excellent. This is a solid and mature handset that may not melt a geek?s heart but will offer users durability and comfort. An excellent keypad, a decent enough screen and mature, subtle styling ? the LG GD550 Pure is a phone to use and enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There?s nothing like the PURE UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, we?ve come to the interface ? or the lack thereof. We?re not being sarcastic here. The LG GD550 Pure won?t leave you scratching your head in wonder. It?s all right in front of you and the D-pad will get you where you want to go in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure is the first and so far only device to feature the PURE UI. The name fits the job perfectly. It?s straightforward and easy to work with ? you don?t even need to read the manual. It's very fast and responsive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how simple can it be? Well to begin with, the thing doesn?t even have a homescreen. So, what? If the iPhone can do without a homescreen, why wouldn?t the LG GD550 Pure?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a slider and the form factor gets involved with the navigation. Slide up and you get straight to the menu. Slide down and the lockscreen kicks in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In closed position, the lockscreen has the usual status bar on top and a reasonably big time and date line. For the lockscreen you can opt between quite a selection of wallpapers and clock styles, including dual time zone. Of course you get notifications too ? like missed calls, or incoming messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get a notification on the lockscreen, the only way to take relevant action is to slide up. Notifications are otherwise static ? you can?t scroll or select them with the D-pad. The soft keys don?t work on the lockscreen either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get when you slide the phone up is essentially a rotating view of the five main icons and these take up the upper half of the screen. You scroll them horizontally with the D-pad. These menu items include Camera, Organiser, Calls, Messages, and More (each with 3 to 4 submenus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower half of the screen is taken up by the items associated with the currently selected menu icon. They?re scrollable with the D-pad too ? up or down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what about the soft keys you might ask. The thing is they only get busy in the deeper levels of the interface ? usually to reveal more options or take you a step back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing to note is that sliding down will terminate all applications and processes apart from four (Call, Camera, Video player, Music player) that you can explicitly mark as exceptions through the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This does at least partially makes up for the fact that you can?t activate the camera when the phone is closed. You need to slide up, press the button to launch the camera and then safely slide down. Not the best solution, but the LG GD550 Pure is not a cameraphone after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, it?s simple and it works just fine. The PURE UI is straightforward, easy to navigate and is responsive and nice looking too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A phonebook full of faces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in the LG GD550 Pure can store up to 1000 entries. You can opt to display the numbers on SIM, in phone memory or both simultaneously. You can order the contacts by first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are either displayed as a list or as pictures. In the pictures layout, you get something quite reminiscent of the Cover Flow interface, only everything is much smaller. Below the contact images you can see the details of the selected contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of available fields, so it's unlikely you will find anything missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Pure offers smooth and problem-free performance when it comes to the most essential task of a phone - making calls. It offers good reception and in-call sound, with pleasing voice quality on both ends of a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no smart dialing however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the GD550 Pure scored a Very Good mark. Here is how it ranks against some of the other handsets we've tested. You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure can handle all of the most common type of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We aren't really the biggest fans of the handset's messaging department but we still believe it's capable enough for most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three message types share a common editor. All you need to do to switch between them is insert some multimedia content - like a photo or audio track for example. The editor itself has rather basic looks and that's one thing we weren't particularly fond of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite easy to work with and mailboxes can be set up in no time. Creating an account is very simple - you need to type your email and password, then choose the type (POP3, IMAP) and your mailbox is automatically configured.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A basic image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of the GD550 Pure is accessible either using the dedicated Media album located on the Camera pane or through the My stuff icon found in the Applications submenu. It offers one view mode: thumbnail with 9 thumbs on screen. Be aware that heavily populated folders take their toll: the gallery refreshes its thumbs every time it's launched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view single pictures in both landscape and portrait. To see further detail, zoom in. Zoom in/out and panning speeds are remarkable for a device in that class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a let down, though. The slow browsing speed inside the gallery is quite a pain. Loading the next image always seems to take forever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the GD550 Pure is almost the same as in the LG BL20 New Chocolate. It sorts tracks by three different filters - artist, album and genre. You can also create your own playlist if you like. There are no visualization options; however on the plus side, if the song you play has album art then it will be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can be minimized. In this case the information on the current track is displayed on the lockscreen. Unfortunately, there is no way to control the player when it?s minimized. You can only mute it using the profile switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 5 equalizer presets on LG GD550 Pure. Sadly, none of them can be modified, nor new ones created.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical for a midrange feature phone, the video player is not much to write home about. Varied codec support is non-existent and you can play only 3gp and some mp4 files at low bitrate. There are only a few options here - landscape, delete or send file. You can jump back and forth in the video timeline though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A simple FM radio onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GD550 Pure has an FM radio with a fairly simple interface, but it?s generally very easy to work with. There is an auto scan feature that locates every radio station in your area and offers to save it. Unfortunately, RDS is not available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG did a good job with the GD550 audio quality. The handset has very decent (although rather quiet audio output), with its only weak point being its high intermodulation distortion and sub-par stereo-crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings in our audio quality test were pretty good to excellent. Given the absence of a 3.5mm audio jack you couldn't really expect miracles from the Pure but if you aren't very demanding the handset will do the job for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Pure boasts a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera with no lens protection or LED flash though we?ve seen a pre-production sample of GD550 that has a LED flash but we?re not sure whether it would get to mass production.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is the same thing we saw in the BL20 New Chocolate and uses the same black and white color scheme. The available features are even fewer than those in the BL20.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself has no special features on offer other than auto-focus. In the user configurable settings are some effects, light sensitivity up to ISO 800, burst mode, white balance, brightness and timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder layout is simple: a column on the bottom where you can toggle between the still camera and video recorder, set brightness options, go to the media album or toggle landscape and full screen view. All the other stuff is packed in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the confirm button of the touchpad as a shutter key too, but if you do there's no way to recompose the shot after locking focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI looks outdated and LG really should have put a bit more work into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the image quality is concerned, it didn?t manage to impress us. Images lack fine detail and there are some artifacts caused by the aggressive compression, noise reduction and oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the colors in most cases are accurate and lively and there is no purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One negative side to imaging is that the camera sensor is oriented so as you should take your landscape photos while you hold the GD550 Pure in portrait position. If you rotate it to a landscape position, you?d get portrait-oriented photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG GD550 Pure. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 is capable of capturing D1 (720 x 480 pixels) videos @ 30fps, which sounds great on paper but in reality things are quite different. Videos lack detail and there are visible compression artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again you should record videos holding the phone in an upright, portrait position as this is the way the camera sensor is oriented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the LG Pure is basic, but reasonably good. It renders most of the web pages very well, but the smallish screen and lack of Flash support make it really just an extra, not something you can seriously surf on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser of the GD550 has a virtual mouse pointer that jumps between links. In most cases the mouse pointer moves rather logically and does the job right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To zoom in or out, use the star and hash buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the settings you can find some options for caching web pages and accepting cookies. Finally, you can disable images to save on data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can open up to two pages simultaneously from the menu. We tried watching mobile YouTube videos and it worked like a charm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer and the standard applications are a pretty basic package too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers daily and monthly view modes only. Naturally alarms can also be set up to remind you of the event at a given time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Memos app as well as an alarm and world clock, a calculator, a voice recorder, stopwatch and unit converter. We can't say anything special about them - all use a basic and simple interface to do their job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on board there is a preinstalled document viewer, which handles office files just fine. With its help you can view Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we also found Google Maps, the Topolon and the Mini Game Planet games as well as a couple of demo games. There is no GPS on board so the use of GMaps is limited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD550 Pure believes there?s no way to take simplicity too far. Everything about this phone ? the styling, user interface, features ? boils down to a single word: simple. It must?ve sounded really good on paper and perhaps that?s what gave the GD550 Pure a green light for production. And it works ? it?s beautiful and simple to use, a stylish phone that?s suitable for everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s no LG Secret, let alone a Crystal or a Chocolate. No thanks, no fancy stuff. Come to think of it, even the 5 megapixel still imaging and D1 video might seem somewhat out of place. But you don?t have to worry too much ? it?s almost as if they?re not there. Seriously, imaging is one of the phone?s big failures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it?s probably what pumps the price up. At about 200 euros, the LG GD550 Pure does come across as overpriced. Maybe it?s overpriced for what it offers ? but not who it offers it too. Grownup users looking for a mature unfussy handset that?s good at the basics may find the price acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s look at the alternatives. The Sony Ericsson Hazel costs the same but has a bigger and better screen, much more capable user interface and plenty of premium features: Wi-Fi, GPS, accelerometer, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Hazel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a bit less, the Symbian-powered Nokia 6700 slide will give you everything you may want in a smartphone, and an excellent camera to boot. The Sony Ericsson Zylo has nearly the same features as the GD550 Pure but the magic W (it?s a Walkman) will attract a different audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6700 slide ? Sony Ericsson Zylo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The year-old LG BL20 New Chocolate is an unavoidable comparison. The touch-sensitive controls and elaborate UI aside, it?s essentially the same phone. Only it?s very much aimed at a completely different crowd ? the suave and the style-conscious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG BL20 New Chocolate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest competition for the right target audience is something like the Nokia 6600i slide. For those who value aesthetics, simplicity and subtlety in equal measure, there isn?t much choice on today?s market dominated by touchscreens and overblown specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6600i slide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, we?ll say it: the older you are, the more likely it is you?ll appreciate the LG GD550 Pure. It?s an easy phone to like but not one to rave about. It?s not a geek?s phone by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a phone a geek?s mother might like and that?s not a bad thing.</paragraph>
