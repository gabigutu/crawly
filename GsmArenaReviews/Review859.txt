			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo came to the Mobile World Congress 2014 floor with a portable 10-inch Yoga and three smartphones under the S line. The S860, S850 and S660 come with brushed aluminum, polycarbonate and glass-like plastics, big displays and MediaTek processors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga 10 HD+ offers 1920 x 1200px resolution on a 10" diagonal and is powered by a quad-core 1.6GHz Snapdragon 400 processor on 2GB of RAM. It also has an optional keyboard dock, which doubles as a snap-on case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S line of smartphones is all about affordability, big screens and MediaTek chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S860 uses a quad-core 1.3GHz processor and has the biggest screen at 5.3". It uses an IPS panel of 1280 x 720px resolution, which works out to a pixel density of 277 ppi. There's an 8MP camera on the back and a 1.6MP one on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is an impressive 4,000mAh unit that can even charge external devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S850 is thinner and lighter and has a glass-like plastic body. It has a 12MP snapper on the back and a 5MP front-facer. The screen here is a 5" panel of the same 720p resolution, only this time it results in a pixel density of 293 ppi. The MediaTek chip has four cores, running at 1.3 GHz each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S660 has the smallest display at 4.7" and uses a lower qHD (540 x 960px) resolution - this results in the lowest density here - 234 ppi. The processor is, again, a 1.3GHz quad-core unit with 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo S860<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S860 comes with a 5.3" IPS screen of 720p resolution, a quad-core 1.3 GHz MediaTek processor, 8MP camera at the rear and a 1.6MP front- facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What impressed us in the S860 is the 4,000mAh battery, which is capable of reverse-charging other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has a brushed aluminum unibody with a pleasantly curved back. The sides of the phone have matte finish and feature the volume keys and power button with great press feedback.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is a welcome upgrade of the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10, which was announced late last year. As the name suggests, it bumps up the resolution from the meager 1280 x 800 pixels up to Full HD 1920 x 1200 px resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a new processor inside, too. Instead of a Mediatek chipset, there is now a quad-core 1.6Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 with 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo is again offering a keyboard accessory that would snap on the tablet screen when it's not used, thus acting as a sort of a protective case. It can even serve as a keyboard dock but it doesn't have a built-in battery inside. Overall, we are not too impressed by the attaching mechanism and the whole thing feels kinda cheap (not to mention overpriced).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ will be available in May 2014 at a starting price of $350.</paragraph>
