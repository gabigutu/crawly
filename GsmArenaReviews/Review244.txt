			<paragraph>Samsung are obviously not of two minds about two-in-one phones. A new dual SIM handset - the Samsung D780 - is underway and it's intended as a more affordable dual SIM solution as compared to the D880 Duos. On the outside, there's nothing cool about Samsung D780 and that's fine by us. The new dual SIM bar means business and its top skill is well tucked under the battery. What you get is quality of build, comfy large keyboard and friendly handling. A big fella by all means, the D780 is a sensible piece of dual SIM action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using two SIM cards in one phone is increasingly an option many are willing to consider. No wonder then, one of the top cell phone makers are reaffirming their commitment to address this kind of demand. Samsung were first among the majors to announce a dual SIM handset in October 2007 - the Samsung D880 Duos, which we reviewed recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well before the D780 and D880 Duos, various Chinese manufacturers have been busy exploring the uncharted territory of dual SIM. We even did an overview of dual SIM solutions back in August last year to help you stay on top of the various options. Philips and WND are among the more popular companies trying to get a piece of the action, while most of the top dogs seem disinterested or are simply trying to avoid potential pressure from the telecoms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 should get a more reasonable price tag than the D880 Duos, which has a rather unjustified initial asking price. After all, the D780 is pitched as a more affordable alternative to D880 Duos. A competitive price tag on D780 will help Samsung set a firm foot in the dual SIM niche.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, enough sidestepping - hit the jump for more Samsung D780.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung D780 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Subdued exterior and plastic all over, Samsung D780 is a straightforward bar shape alternative of the Duos slider. The neat and conservative bar won't have your mouth watering, but the sensible handling won't get you complaining either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 measures 115 x 49.6 x 15.7 mm and weighs 108.5 g. And that's big - it's the first impression it leaves - one XXL son of a gun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 brings no design novelties. The entire body is covered with dark silver plastic, save for the grooved black surface at the bottom of the rear. Silver accents have been applied sparingly: a frame around the D-pad, the volume rocker, the dual SIM keys and the camera key. The silver ridges between rows of keys on the keypad are a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is asymmetrically split between the 2.1" QVGA display and the ample keypad. The D-pad with confirming action is enclosed in the black frame surrounding the screen. It's conservatively styled, though comfortable and responsive. On the sides of the D-pad, the traditional two soft keys are placed - this time, at a considerable distance from the bottom of the screen. The Call and End keys, along with the C correction key in-between, are outside this layout and blend with the alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is great for typing, with large enough buttons and sweet press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung D780 features the camera shutter key and the connectivity port under its plastic cover. The Connectivity port is, as usually, used for plugging the supplied charger, data cable, or wired headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left we find the lanyard eyelet, volume rocker, the dedicated dual-SIM key and the microSD card slot, which also has a plastic cover. The side controls on D780 offer better elevation and tactility, as opposed to D880 Duos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the D780 are completely bereft of controls, quite unusual for bar shaped handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of Samsung D780 is divided in two - the smooth dark silver battery cover and the grooved black surface down the bottom. The 2 megapixel camera lens and self-portrait mirror are placed in the top right corner of the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera works in portrait orientation, even if the shutter key on the left side suggests a regular landscape position. The camera key is actually quite meaningless, as it only gets used for starting the camera. While shooting, it makes a lot more sense to use the center of the D-pad as a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the powerful Samsung 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery. It's quoted at up to 250 h of standby time and up to 3 h of talk time. In reality the battery was a decent performer - we had to recharge the D780 every three or four days. You shouldn't forget that the battery powers two separate transceiver units inside the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display - keep away from sun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung D780 has an average 2.1" TFT screen of QVGA resolution capable of displaying up to 256K colors. Typical Samsung, visibility under direct sunlight is poor. Unfortunately, poor in this case means almost illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white keypad backlighting is even and strong. The backlighting of the navigation keys enhances user-friendliness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface unaltered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung D780 interface has the typical Samsung styling. It is virtually the same as that of D880 Duos, so, we're reusing most of the interface screenshots of D880 Duos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen doesn't offer the Samsung dynamic Home screen with the uGo feature. All you can use is regular wallpaper. You can also opt to display Calendar or a single/dual zone clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a 4 x 3 grid of icons. They have a nice gradient background. You also have a choice of three graphic themes. The interface itself is very responsive and there are nice visual transitions when you navigate the menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook both ways<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Samsung D780 stores up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. You can set it to save your new contacts by default to either your phone memory, SIM 1 or SIM 2 (or of course get prompted every time). When viewing contacts, you can also opt between displaying phone memory, SIM memory (with further filtering for either SIM card) or both Phone and SIM memory. Other than that, over 25 fields of information are available for each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception with the Samsung D780 phone was excellent (on both SIM cards). A nice feature is the Smart search dialing. When you enter some digits, the handset fetches automatically the contacts that contain them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Samsung D780 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. D780 is not the loudest of Samsung handsets and, even though it scored above average, voice is its most problematic aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about our loudspeaker test, as well as the results of all other tested devices here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 can handle SMS, MMS, and email. Naturally, a T9 dictionary is at hand, and it does its job quickly and intuitively. Incoming messages, like calls, can be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good but it doesn't support SSL, so it's useless with providers that require it - like Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Awkward file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung D780 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. There are 32MB of internal memory at your disposal - at least that's the amount of available space we saw, contrary to the 100MB of onboard storage quoted by an official Samsung site. And of course, you can always top that thanks to the memory card slot with up to 2GB microSD cards supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. You can copy or move files freely and you can create and delete folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were unpleasantly surprised by the fact that switching between phone memory and the memory card is quite uncommon - the # and o keys are used for that - go figure! We've seen a similar solution with Motorola, but never with Samsung - at least in recent years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. You can view the pictures as a plain list or as a list with thumbnails. And again, you can sort files by date, type, name, and size. You can view pictures in both portrait and landscape mode. Again, thanks to the capable processor browsing and zooming images is a pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is inadequate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung handsets usually excel in music player capabilities (and audio quality too, we should add). With Samsung D780 this is not the case unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player lacks the advanced track filtering found on most Samsung handsets (or Sony Ericsson units) such as author, album, genre, recent, favorites or whatever. It falls back to the original dummy functionality seen way back in Samsung D900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create your own playlists of course, but you better put your music in the auto-created Music folder on the memory card, otherwise adding tracks from another folder is too much hassle. Other Samsung handsets didn't have any problems auto updating their Music library with all the tracks you have on memory card no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can be minimized to play in the background, but the current track doesn't show up on the standby screen so you can't control it freely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 is complete with an FM radio. There is no support for RDS but, unlike the Music player, you can control the radio straight from the Home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't have many features but all the essentials are covered - it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have made a name for themselves for the commendable audio quality of their handsets. The D780 easily outperforms most contenders in this area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the basic music player, Samsung D780 scores quite well on every audio quality reading. The only concern is the high IMD level, much like with Samsung D880 Duos. That easily becomes acceptable by downing the volume a level or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the results are here for you to see and draw the conclusions. In case you want to learn more about our test, click here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's a self-portrait mirror but no LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, while options appear as semi-transparent popup menus. The settings here are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot, mosaic shot and panorama), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, antique, moonlight etc.), white balance, and ISO (up to 400).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the camera sensor is set so that the camera is better off when used in portrait mode only - as funny as it may sound - that way you get the regular landscape images. To get a tall portrait shot you have to turn the handset to a landscape position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter if you choose portrait or landscape mode - when you select the fullscreen mode for the viewfinder it crops the live feed from the camera lens so that it fits the display. Not to worry though, the actual photos taken by the camera are not cropped. Samsung D900 had the same issues by the way and that didn't stop it from becoming a bestseller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is useless; using the OK key is far more convenient. We were pleasantly surprised by the color rendering and dynamic range. Noise is kept under control and photos are fine with sharpening applied carefully. The Samsung D780 camera made a really nice impression and we got to admit it's among th best 2 megapixel cameras we've seen on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples produced by the 2 megapixel camera of Samsung D780:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the video recording capabilities of the camera. Samsung D780 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for some of the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 captures video in CIF resolution at 15fps and clips are recorded in MPEG4 format.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser almost unusable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung D780 you can count on EDGE and GPRS only for browsing internet on the go. Unfortunately, the handset doesn't come with the latest NetFront 3.4 web browser but instead uses the Openwave browser dating all the way back to Samsung D900. The Openwave web browser doesn't even have desktop-like rendering and most images are resized beyond recognition with the default Smart Fit option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer topped with document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung D780 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important, and private. Alarm slots are also five, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 also features an office documents viewer along the lines of most Samsung handsets out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to games, Samsung D780 is quite well geared. A whole bunch of games are preinstalled just waiting for you to have some free time to spend. The games the D780 bundles up are Cannonball, Forgotten Warrior, Freekick, Arch Angel, Minigolf Las Vegas (trial), Tetris Mania (trial) and Asphalt 2 (trial). What's not so good about them is that you've probably seen every one of them on other Samsung handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pivotal feature of Samsung D780 is indeed the dual SIM capability. It is important to note that even though the two SIM cards are active simultaneously, there are still some limitations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts with the master and slave SIM card hierarchy. The master SIM is the default (primary) one used for calls, messaging, GPRS/EDGE, etc, while the slave card has calls and SMS capability only. Of course, the master and slave cards can be swapped with a flick of a system setting, but in this case a reboot is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crucial aspect of this subordination is the frequency band limitation - only the master SIM card has tri-band GSM support. The transceiver responsible for the slave SIM is a dual-band one only - that makes the dual SIM functionality unusable in countries that use the 1900 Mhz band such as North America.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you insert one or two new SIM cards in Samsung D780, you need to assign them names and priority to get started. Once you are done, you can start reaping the dual SIM benefits. If you need to make changes to that setup later, you can open the simple SIM management interface by pressing the dedicated key on the handset's left side. The interface is accessible from the Settings menu too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM management interface is rather simple, allowing the user to set the primary card, and to name or enable/disable one or both cards. While the enable/disable option is a matter of mere seconds, changing the primary and secondary card requires a restart of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management, phonebook and messaging specifics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you want to call somebody, all you need is type or scroll the phone number and then choose which card to use for the outgoing call. The primary SIM is default and pressing the call key directly dials the number using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you wish to call using the secondary SIM card, pressing the dedicated SIM management key switches the SIM card for the outgoing call. There are no delays or glitches whatsoever using this feature. We are particularly pleased with the Samsung implementation of this interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call the caller number/name is accompanied by the name of the SIM card which is receiving the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is also very well geared to accommodate the dual SIM functionality. It displays the type of call (incoming, outgoing, etc.), the SIM card, the caller number/name and the number of calls. When you select a log entry, you can see the entire call history, including the time and date, the SIM card again and the call duration. You can opt to return the call using the default SIM card or the secondary one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new number can easily be saved in either the phone memory or on one of the two SIM cards. In contacts, there are tabbed menus, which are shortcuts to the Groups, FDN (frequently dialed numbers), SIM 1 and SIM 2. So, if you rarely use the SIM contacts, it is better to set the phone memory view option, yet the SIM contacts remain at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook itself displays the name, the default number (when a name is highlighted) and the memory used for contact storage - an icon to the right for SIM 1 and SIM 2 designates where the contact is stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a new message doesn't differ from any other Samsung phone and is much like making a call. If a message is sent straight away it goes through the primary SIM card. However with a single press of the dual SIM key, you can channel it through the secondary SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that's about all there is to know about call and message management in a dual SIM scenario. Again, as we already said in the beginning of this review, bear in mind that there are certain limitations to the technology, too. You can only use the primary SIM card for GPRS/EDGE connectivity and it's only the primary SIM card that benefits from tri-band connectivity. The secondary SIM card works in dual-band mode only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D780 is a well balanced phone for the mass user and the dual SIM action is truly an ace up its sleeve. The lack of 3G support and the poor music player and web browser are the main drawbacks - we've already been there with Samsung D880 Duos. Again much like the D880 Duos, the Samsung D780 packs an excellent camera and a rather large body. Having mentioned it, Samsung D780 brings nothing we didn't see in the Duos, except for the different form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the appeal of Samsung D780 is not skin deep. It may only play one song, but it plays it right, and in a market niche wide open it just can't be a one hit wonder. After all, it takes a few tries like D780 before we move on to dual SIM Ultra handsets and dual SIM smartphones.</paragraph>
