			<paragraph>They certainly don't make them like that anymore. Been a while though and we're not sure if this is a compliment. It's been long enough since speed dial was invented. And T9 predictive text. Or color displays. So, what's the Nokia 515 doing here?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No really, what's the story. Did someone press the wrong button on the time machine? And where the hell are the Sony Ericsson T-series or Samsung E590? The Motorola RAZR? Gone but not forgotten. Well, the Nokia 515 is here and now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finnish feature phones are rolling like clockwork but few make it to our homepage - be it a touchscreen-flaunting Asha or a bargain-basement offering with a couple of SIM slots and a flashlight. The Nokia 515 is obviously different, it looks like ten or so years late but it just couldn't care less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming from an old-fashioned candybar phone in a market dominated by massive touchscreens and multi-core CPUs, this kind of confidence borders on arrogance. On the other hand, it's vintage Nokia at its best, with rock-solid build and heartwarming simplicity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 is a phone that seems out of place but one too that will make many people feel at home. What poses an even bigger contradiction is that it's actually expensive for what it is - an ordinary dumbphone with no touchscreen and less apps than the Ashas. At the same time, it's a premium design in the entry-level segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got features that more than justify the asking price - the aluminum build, Gorilla Glass 2 covered curved screen, a 5MP camera and LED flash. And it sure has the look and feel of a true classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, this could be the phone to get if smartphones seem too complicated, but also one that can see tablets and phablets left at home. Let's see what the Nokia 515 can deliver other than some old-school thrills or the comfort of the familiar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 comes in a rather unassuming, budget-looking blue box made out of recycled paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside it, you'll find the wall mount charger, Nokia's WH-108 headset with a microphone (no volume controls on that one) as well as a pin for accessing the phone's innards. It would've been nice if Nokia completed the package with a stand-alone microUSB cable or a microSD card slot, but sadly that's not the case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 515 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 measures 114 x 48 x 11 mm, which is in line with the company's featurephones of old - the 6700 classic measures 109.8 x 45 x 11.2 mm. Notably, the 515 is thin enough to allow effortless pocketability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of weight, the Nokia 515 weighs a hair over 101 grams, which makes it one of the lightest handsets around (although the Asha lineup goes even lower). The aluminum casing and Gorilla Glass 2 covering the display add their fair share of weight, but on a shell this compact that's barely felt.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 features an extremely clean and minimalist design. It's understated elegance make its back look as upmarket Italian suite. The glossy plastic used for the keys at the front do spoil the impression a bit, but generally the 515 looks much better than anything else in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset is made of a single piece of aluminum with a rubber patch towards the bottom enabling the normal functioning of the radios inside. It's also removable, by sticking the supplied pin into the small hole at the bottom, giving you access to the battery and card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got the back version of the Nokia 515 here in the office, but the phone is also available in white with a silver aluminum back. In our mind it looks even better than the black one, but as usual picking between the two is a matter of personal choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said the front of the phone is its least stylish part, packing a small 2.4" display with a classical alphanumeric keypad below it. The oldschool combination does have a touch of class to it, but we really wish Nokia went with a different material for the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 2, making sure the screen underneath won't be easy to scratch or break if you drop it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, Nokia 515 features a classic front configuration - a screen at the top with physical keypad underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation deck is built around a four-way D-pad with a confirmation center key. There's a soft key and a call key on either side. The controls are adequately sized and have good tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numpad has nicely comfortably keys of good size and the same nice feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the navigation deck is the 2.4" QVGA display, which we'll inspect in greater detail in a few moments. At the very top is the Nokia logo as well as the speaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia 515 is bare, while the right holds only the volume rocker. The lack of additional buttons and ports on the sides adds lets the metallic profile of the handset remain smooth and cool looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the 515 continues the clean design trend and holds only the back panel ejector pinhole. The microphone is actually located above the lowest row of the keypad, so there are no other apertures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we see all the connectivity ports - the microUSB port next to the 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera with LED flash is the most notable feature on the back. The speaker grille is near the bottom, next to the plastic patch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already discussed the good-looking aluminum back of the phone. It's removable, although the process is a bit odd. You need a pin, which Nokia has supplied in the package, to insert into the at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've opened the cover you see the 1200mAh battery. The SIM card and microSD card slot are placed above it, but unfortunately in such a way that neither of them is hotswappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the phone doesn't flex, neither does it bend nor twist. It's a very solid build that will last ages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Nokia 515 is a 2.4-incher of QVGA resolution. This adds up to the very modest 167ppi density, which however isn't that bad for the entry level class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is decent with contrast levels good for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as sunlight legibility is concerned, we are happy to report the Nokia 515 does very decently beating far more expensive handsets in our test. You won't have any problems reading messages or check out who's calling you even in direct sunlight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 is pleasantly joyful to hold. You will have absolutely no trouble operating it with one hand and its aluminum back provides a great feel in the hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 is a S40 6th edition device. It uses Active standby as its default homescreen layout - you might be familiar with it if you have used a Nokia phone of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It divides the screen into tiles that can be scrolled with the D-pad and edited as you see fit. They can be rearranged but the default layout makes sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general indicators are on top, featuring date, time and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the end key while the keypad is locked displays a lockscreen showing the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be viewed in the traditional Grid, List or Single view modes. The left button is assigned to the Go To function by default, which brings up a list of shortcuts (you can choose which ones go up there), so that accessing the most common features is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, as a Series 40 device, the Nokia 515 will run Java apps so you can extend the functionality. It's not as good as a fully featured smart platform, but it cover some of the basics like, say, a Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 handles messaging without a problem, though with no fanfare either. The supported formats are SMS, MMS, flash and audio messages and the phone handles email too. The keyboard of the 515 will give you reasonable typing speed. It's a good package in terms of software support too, with Nokia Messaging and Nokia Chat enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols and allows you to setup multiple accounts. There's support for SSL too, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Images in the gallery app, called Photos, can be viewed in either portrait or landscape mode - there's no auto-rotation though. In landscape mode, images load full screen. Photos can be organized into albums, viewed in timeline (they are ordered by the date they were taken) and sorted by date, name or size. Slideshows with selectable transition effects are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it's still here - but it's hidden in the Applications menu. It's more of a file manager that also supports picture viewing, though. It can manage folders and files - both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia 515 has a basic set of features and brings supports for the most popular formats. The player handles MP3, WMA, WAV and eAAC+. Tracks can be filtered by artist, album and genre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the A2DP profile is supported, allowing Bluetooth streaming of stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An RDS-enabled FM radio is available on the Nokia 515 as well and it can play through the powerful loudspeaker. Thanks to the built-on FM antenna, you can start the app almost instantly with just one key stroke (the media control on the left side of the phone). The FM radio starts playing immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of video playback the Nokia 515 supports MP4, H.264, H.263 and 3GP. Let's face it, watching a movie on this small low-res display is not exactly pleasurable, so we doubt anyone will give this feature much consideration. Playing the occasional clip someone sent you via MMS is as much use as this player might be getting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, and you get pause and skip buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 comes with the familiar Nokia web browser. Its start screen has the usual URL and search bars and three side-scrollable panes below, which are quite reminiscent of the Symbian homescreen (complete with the three dots at the bottom that indicate the current pane).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From left to right, the panes are History, Featured (lists popular sites in several categories) and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser uses the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quicker this way (particularly on slower networks) and don't waste much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is not going to make your head spin, not by a longshot. It can't use its feature phone status as an excuse either, because it's not the cheapest one around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is the full-featured app that has month, week, and day modes and five types of events to set up. It's nowhere near the standards set by the smartphones around, even the entry-level ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected day of the week, even when the phone is switched off. The other organizing features available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515's calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition, a loan calculator is also available. The consistently useful unit converter tops the list of additional applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 also includes Notes, Countdown timer, To-Do List and World Clock apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 relies on a single speakerphone that's located on the back. Nokia feature phone have always boasted excellent speakers and the 515 is no exception. In our dedicated loudspeaker test it managed a Good score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means you'll be able to hear the Nokia 515 ring even if you're in a loud environment. Its ringing sound will get to you even if you've been covered it with a pile of stuff or put it in a large purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia 515 does decently well, achieving some good scores and garnishing them with about average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones leads to a rather large spike in intermodulation distortion and a moderate one in stereo crosstalk as well as a rather big drop in volume levels. Overall, the low-standing 515 does well, but it won't get any audiophiles excited.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic 5MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 515 comes with a fixed-focus 5MP camera that takes photos at maximum resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. There are options for white balance, several effects and a self-timer. Nokia has even enabled it to shoot panorama photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, we reasonably pleased with the photos the Nokia 515 took. Admittedly, there are many other 5MP shooters around that do a way better job, but they come at a price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color reproduction is good and white balance is fairly accurate, while the amount of resolved detail is well above average for the 5MP league. There's quite a lot of noise, though, so it's not all good with the 515 snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here are a few camera samples to give you an idea of what we're dealing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera is limited to QVGA@30fps, which means no one would take video recording with it seriously. Here's a video sample to give you an idea of the quality, but as the specs suggest, it's as poor as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an unprocessed video sample (0:30 @ 4.00MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Return of the candybar? Well, not quite. Candybars have nowhere to return from because they've always been around. We haven't been seeing much of them for a good couple of years now but, you know, there's been more interesting stuff going around. And we don't think the Nokia 515 is even trying to do anything about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it takes some guts to put a phone like that out there. Nokia's current crop of feature phones is doing quite well for the company to take any risks with the lineup. Then again, we wouldn't call the typical Nokia build quality, great design and classic form factor exactly a risk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum body is extra solid and looks it - handling something so compact, yet strong and firm, brought memories of back when the Finns were at the top of their game. Now, this is just a lowly dumbphone, so giving one of those the premium treatment may as well be a pointless exercise. It does seem though like the designers who worked on it gave it a solid effort and enjoyed themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6500 classic ? Nokia 6300</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware offered is quite good for the class too. A 5MP camera is nearly unheard of in this segment, let alone a LED flash. It's things like dual-band 3G with fasts data, email for exchange and USB modem that make it a well-focused package. The absence of Wi-Fi did seem as a downside at first but this is certainly not a phone for teens who're always on Facebook and chat (though the social network integration is there). The Nokia 515 is more a travelling executive's backup phone. The dual-SIM version will fit that job nicely too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Availability of packages like this one, and many others in the Nokia three-digit series (100 to 300) is typically limited to emerging markets, but the Nokia 515 will be available in Europe too. Of course, there's no denying the appeal of proper keypads to the elderly and the old-fashioned but the Nokia 515 isn't just a phone for people who didn't get the message about smartphones and phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe this partly explains too why Nokia is pushing a higher than usual asking price. At a recommended price of ?115, there are a handful of entry-level smartphones - Android and Lumias alike. Most of them will over an overwhelming amount of extra functionality, even if they won't quite match the battery endurance. The better-equipped Ashas are having a strong case too, and these come with either touchscreen or a QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Young S6310 ? Nokia Lumia 520 ? Nokia Asha 501 ? Nokia Asha 210</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, touchscreen smartphones are only going to get more popular in developing markets, and the Nokia 515 has no illusions about its chances. There must be still people out there though who can, and will, appreciate style, simplicity and timeless design. Oh, and speed dial.</paragraph>
