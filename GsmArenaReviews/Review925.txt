			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is presenting two new Surface tablets, saying "reinventing the wheel is not the goal, making it better is." This better wheel of theirs features a more powerful chipset, improved battery life, better screen, more ports, and even the accessories are better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, there were quite a few complaints about the original Surface duo, but Microsoft seems to have taken them to heart and made the tablets better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-end model is the Surface 2 Pro with a new Haswell processor from Intel. This new chip allows it to run faster, cooler and use less energy in the process. Microsoft claims the Pro 2 is faster than 95% of laptops out there and even showed how it processes 6K footage (9x Full HD resolution) in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life has gone up by an equally impressive 75% (again thanks to Haswell), and that's before you add the Battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of covers, the new Type Cover is 1mm thinner than before ? that's as thin as the first-gen Touch Cover ? but features an improved key travel of 1.5mm and it's even backlit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 (it's just that now, the "RT" has been dropped) has seen some major improvements too. For one, it's now white to accentuate its magnesium build (there won't be a black version). Also, Microsoft moved to from a 3 piece design to a 2 piece one, which is also thinner and lighter than the first generation product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 features the same 1080p screen from the Surface Pro 2, no more 1,366 x 768 resolution that other tablets make fun of. The chipset is 3-4 times faster too and the bus speeds for memory and Wi-Fi have also been improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life on this model has been improved by a modest 25%, but battery life was a problem for the Pro more than the RT.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second-gen Surfaces will run Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 RT, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stay tuned as we're looking to get some face time with the new tablets and we'll post hands-on impressions here!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Surface 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 has a lot of bad history to make up for (not to mention $900 million to recoup), and Microsoft pulled out all the stops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new table is thinner (8.9mm) and lighter (it's under 680g) with a simpler magnesium build that has only two parts instead of three. It's painted white so that the magnesium looks cooler, says Microsoft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better yet, it's no longer treated as a second class citizen, but is equal to the Surface Pro 2 in many respects. Most importantly, it gets the same 10.6" ClearType 1080p display as the Pro - the gimped resolution of the Surface RT was a big complaint with iPads and Android tablets posting ever-higher pixel density numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color accuracy of the screen has been increased by "46 percent," whatever that means exactly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera is pretty impressive with a 1/3" sensor - that's as big as most sensors on smartphones (and we're talking high-end here). Plus, it has only 3.5MP resolution, which is great for a front-facing camera but our point is its pixels must be larger than the ones in the HTC One. The camera on the back is a 5MP shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 also has a much more powerful chipset than its predecessor, another thing the RT was criticized about. The Tegra 4 chipset provides enough oomph for the improved multi-tasking that Windows 8.1 RT includes, things like split screen multitasking (and yes, the tablet drops the RT moniker, but the OS keeps it). We're not so sure about the 2GB of RAM though, that's as much as phones get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was demoed running a game on one half of the screen and an Office app on the other. The presenters were showing off Halo, of course, perhaps the best known Microsoft game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new tablet also borrows the improved kickstand from its Pro counterpart - it can be set at the previous 22° angle, but it can also be moved to a second position at 40° for taller people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides a more powerful chipset, the connectivity has also been improved by replacing the old USB 2.0 port with a speedy USB 3.0 one. Also there are a couple of loudspeakers, one on each side, with Dolby sound tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 will be up for pre-order soon, priced at $450 for the 32GB version and you'll be getting a ton of goodies for your cash, including a whopping 200GB of SkyDrive storage for a year, as well as free Wi-Fi and international calling with Skype.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Covers hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft showed off three types of covers for the Surface tablets and you can use them with either the Surface 2 or the Pro 2. Two covers should be familiar from the first generation tablets - the Touch Cover and the Type Cover - but the third one is new, the Battery Cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Type Cover 2 is a proper keyboard with keys and everything but Microsoft engineers have managed to get it to only 2.5mm thick. Keys have 1.5mm travel and have backlighting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Cover 2 doesn't have physical keys but instead relies on sensors to figure out where your finger landed. Many, many more sensors than the original Touch Cover - the count has gone from 80 to a whopping 1,092. This should improve accuracy and also enables gestures. It will be available in will be available in cyan, purple, magenta, and black and has backlighting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Cover is similar to the Type Cover 2, but packs a battery inside. This turns the Surface 2 or Pro 2 into a hybrid laptop in essence. At $200, the Power Cover promises a 2.5x increase in battery life, but won't be available until early next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft also showed off a dock that accepts a Surface Pro 2 tablet and adds more ports to it (Ethernet ports, external monitors, keyboard jacks and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Surface Remix project, an attachable cover that targets musicians. This opens up the door for a completely new type of Cover - a specialized cover for an app that is much more user friendly than a regular keyboard where key mappings are arbitrary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Surface 2 Pro hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Surface 2 Pro slate from Microsoft looks a lot like its predecessor, but with lots of changes under the hood. A few numbers you'll be seeing a lot: the Surface 2 Pro has 50% more accurate colors on the display, 50% faster graphics, 75% more battery life and 20% better overall performance than its predecessor. Thanks to the new hardware the Surface 2 was able to play, fast forward and edit hassle-free 6K videos. It also supports external displays with resolution of up to 3840 x 2160.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Surface 2 Pro is powered by Intel's (fourth generation) Core i5 4200U chipset and has a dual-core 1.6GHz processor with multi-threading and a maximum turbo clock speed of 2.6GHz. Also included are Intel HD 4400 graphics and either 4GB or 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also new for the Surface 2 Pro is the new two-stage kickstand that should ease your work with the slate when you lean it on your lap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Surface 2 Pro is occupied almost entirely by the 10.6-inch 1080p ClearType display. The unit used for the Surface 2 Pro (and the Surface 2) has 50% more color accuracy when compared to the previous generation Surface Pro. The display also supports pen input with the bundled Surface Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive Windows key and the 720p camera for video chats are just below and above the display, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Surface 2 Pro has another 720p-capable camera and the kickstand. The microSD slot is below the kickstand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Surface 2 Pro has the 3.5mm audio jack, the volume rocker and one USB 3.0 port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side hosts the mini DisplayPort, the docking station pins and one of the speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the tablet has the pins for the Touch, Type, Remix and Power Covers, while the lonely Power/Lock key is at the top of the Surface 2 Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 Pro is made entirely of magnesium and looks really beautiful, especially when you attach one of those colorful covers. The magnesium will help the slate survive a few close encounters with the floor and it also won't attract as much fingerprints and smudges as other materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Surface 2 Pro runs on the latest Windows 8.1 Pro version and comes with deep SkyDrive integration plus 200GB SkyDrive free storage for two years. Microsoft is also giving you free Skype international calls and Wi-Fi for one year. Unfortunately the MS Office 365 suit has just one-month free trial and then you'll have to either buy it or use its subscription plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft launches pre-order campaigns for the Surface 2 Pro in 21 markets tomorrow, while the tablet will ship a month later - on October 22. The 64 GB model costs $899, 128GB price is $999, the 256GB edition is $1299 and the 512GB Surface 2 Pro is priced at $1799. We guess these prices are for the 4GB Surface 2 Pro slates, and you'll have to add a good $100 more if you want 8GB of RAM.</paragraph>
