			<paragraph>Just made commercially available, the Nokia 6500 classic is a sight for the sore eyes of thousands of slim-phone lovers, who had been quivering with anticipation. The new addition to the Nokia Series 40 team had us equally impatient to see what it's capable of. The Nokia 6500 classic is slim, but not enough to slip our scrutiny. So, sit back as we put this thin gadget through its paces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the deservingly warm welcomed Nokia 6300, it seemed the legendary Nokia 6230 had finally found its rightful successor. As time passed however, the slim Finn was having harder and harder time standing its ground to a growing number of rivals. Now Nokia is throwing another super thin phone in the battle and it seems to be a worthy reinforcement. Armed with 1 GB of onboard memory and design that simply cannot go unnoticed, Nokia 6500 classic surely deserves attention. So, let us give it all of ours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Box filled with paper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you expected miracles from the Nokia 6500 classic box you might end up disappointed. In the slim (what else?) retail package we found a charger, a wired handsfree and a microUSB cable. A miniUSB obviously would've been too large for the slim body, hence the not-so-popular microUSB format is used. Not that this will bother anyone, as the cable can be easily carried along if needed that badly. Leaving that aside, the box reveals a CD with the required PC sync software, a manual and, finally, a quick start guide.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sleek slim<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you thought Nokia and thin simply cannot go together, then it's about time you reconsidered. Nokia 6500 classic is as thin as 9.5mm, which just makes it the slimmest Nokia to date. There are very few handsets from the competition, that can beat it, as well. Well, the sole existence of Samsung U100 is enough to compel humility in any slim handset, but that's another story. Anyway, Nokia 6500 classic is truly adorable for its stunning design and slim body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 classic comes in two color versions - black and bronze - and both do the handset justice in our opinion. Both color versions look much better than Nokia 6300 but, as you know, there is nothing more subjective than taste, so everyone should judge for themselves. In any case, the almost completely smooth sides of the handset benefit the design tremendously. There are no controls, and even splits between panels are hardly noticeable. In terms of dimensions, besides the already mentioned inspiring 9.5 mm thickness, the Nokia 6500 measures 109.8 mm in height and 45 mm in width - both falling within the golden mean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Examining the handset's body, one thing is strikingly noticeable: the absence of quite a few controls that we're used to seeing in mobile phones. But, one thing at a time, let's now start with the face of Nokia 6500 classic - the front panel. The earpiece is placed at the top, dead center, with the 2" display right under it. The display itself is of praiseworthy quality but we'll come back to that later in our review. Let us now pay due respect to the keypad. A few things ought to be mentioned here. Beginning with the good news, we have to say that the D-pad is among the best we have ever touched. Not so with the rest of the keypad though - the keys are far too tightly packed and may prove quite a trial for users with larger fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the alphanumeric keys are utterly flat, with only a thin metal ridge marking the end of each row. It doesn't do touch orientation any good, so typing without looking at the keypad is nearly impossible with this handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the handset's sides, we find nothing but a microphone pinhole at the bottom and the microUSB port at the top. No other functional elements are to be seen. The USB port is used for everything from charging and transferring data, to connecting a wired headset. This has both its pros and cons but we somehow feel the advantages are more. It allows charging the phone while transferring your data to and from PC, which is a feature we missed with most of the Nokia phones we have recently reviewed. On a different note, this layout makes it impossible to connect a headset and listen to music while charging for example, but this is definitely a thing we can live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning to the phone's back panel, we come upon three functional elements - the camera lens, the dual LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. Further details on those are to follow later on in the review. We will only mention here that the camera lens is unprotected and is therefore prone to scratches and fingerprints. The fact that it is slightly embedded in the surface should probably ensure some protection but still isn't quite enough in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover is not as easy as it might sound. According to the manual, all you need to do is push the bottom part of the back cover downwards. The problem is the cover itself is so tight that removing it requires quite an effort. And this is further complicated by the fact that the phone is so light, you cannot help worrying you might break it. Furthermore, you will probably have the same difficulties closing the phone after that. The cover can only be slid back in a very specific position you will need time finding. Not that you will have to do that very often but it can be quite annoying. Anyway, under the cover lies the 830 mAh battery. It is supposed to provide 300 hours of standby or five and a half hours of talk time. In reality these times are hardly achievable but it will give you good three days of battery life under moderate usage (15 minutes of telephony plus about 45 minutes of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up inspecting the phone's hardware, we have to say that we are generally very pleased with its build quality. Materials of very high quality have been used and that contributes to both the handset's looks and sturdiness. The weight of the handset however is distributed rather irregularly to the top, so when you hold the 6500 in your hand at the base it can easily flip over and find itself on the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, the backlighting is even and strong enough to facilitate usability both in daylight and in dark conditions. The display is bright enough, so nothing to worry about if you use your phone in dark environments frequently.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Beauty on display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 classic has a display that probably won't stun you with size - the 2.0" diagonal is on the small side considering the price range. On the other hand, the image quality could probably make you forgive that. It is surely among the best on the market in any conditions - from the darkest to the most brightly sunlit spots, Nokia 6500 classic offers great quality. The QVGA resolution is not much of a boast but it does a job just good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither backlighting, nor contrast is user-configurable. In the menu you can only set the phone's behavior in power-saving mode. An animated screen-saver can be set to appear on the display and, consequently, convert into a screen-saver showing a digital clock, the current date, and icons indicating missed events, if any. All these details are perfectly legible in any light condition. In the menu you will also find a sleeping mode option, with which the display goes out completely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, signal reception and call clarity have not been compromised in Nokia 6500 classic. The calls are loud and clear on both ends and you will have no problems communicating with this phone. The lack of video calls can be considered a real disappointment. With 3G on board, Nokia could've enabled it without much of an effort. Video calling isn't that frequently used anyway, so it won't be so badly missed. The vibration of the phone is a bit weak but the loudspeaker is among the most powerful we have tested. It pays the price of reducing the audio quality but it will be easy to hear even in the noisiest environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 6500 classic ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our new speakerphone loudness test. You can find more info about our test as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Series 40, 5th<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 classic brings no surprises in terms of user interface. It employs Series 40 5th edition user interface. In case you are wondering what happened to the 4th edition - Nokia decided to skip it and went straight to 5th from the 3rd. Rumor has it, the peculiar decision may be rooted in the fact that the number 4 is considered unlucky is some Asian countries. But leaving the name aside, we have to say navigating and controlling the phone are almost the same as with the previous UI edition and identical to Nokia 7500. The phone still offers a vast number of configurable options but that somehow complicates the menu structure and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in stand-by, the display as usually visualizes the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the descriptions of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color. You can also turn on the active stand by mode if you want to. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated according to the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player. At the very bottom are displayed events from the calendar set for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 6500 classic can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear simultaneously, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icons grid. The icons themselves haven't been changed at all, keeping the well known stylish design. The selected icon is animated. The icons can also be freely reordered within the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will even be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. We wouldn't expect anything else from a Series 40 device anyway. Also, we didn't experience any halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Themes for the thins<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having in mind that looks are among Nokia 6500 classic's strong points, it is very important that the themes follow suit. Luckily, this is just the case as all the 7 preinstalled themes on Nokia 6500 classic are fine-looking and provide the perfect finish to the handset's appearance. We personally enjoyed the default black the most. Naturally, you can also download additional themes for your Nokia 6500 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 6500 Classic. These should be enough to suit practically any situation you could possible face. There is also a Flight mode, which turns off all transceivers on the phone. This can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3 player for example. Furthermore, as opposed to some other brands of phones (take Sony Ericsson feature phones for example), the flight mode can be used without a SIM card inserted, which we found convenient.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People you know<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 6500 classic offers space for up to 2000 contacts, as well as various configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also be enlarged, should the user find that necessary, and it's an option that will surely be widely appreciated. Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another application worth our compliments is voice dial; no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary. There is also a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 6500 classic won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message menu has not undergone any modifications either. It is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 6500 is capable of receiving and sending multimedia messages, sound and flash messages via MMS, and emails. The SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do in order to turn a regular SMS into an MMS is insert a picture or any other multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to select a favorite message contact in case you have frequent correspondence with one and the same person. Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB. A handy feature is that the phone will automatically scale down pictures for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is luckily no longer a built-in Java application but the fully functional email client instead, that we have come to know from most Nokia smartphones. That makes it much faster and generally better than the one used in Nokia 6300 for example. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Both message headers only and entire messages can be downloaded, depending on your choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>XpressMusic player becomes standard equipment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia 5300 XpressMusic phone and the Nokia 7500 Prism. It is a great player originally reserved for music-oriented Nokia phones and is obviously becoming the standard player for all recent Series 40 devices. Besides managing all the typical functions of a music player, it also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player is highly customizable through a number of themes that are at your disposal. These were all quite eye pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the retail package you will find a Nokia HS-82 headset. There is very little chance that you will fall in love with it. If you use your player rather rarely however, and do not expect wonders from your headset, it may just do the job. The handset features a microUSB jack for connecting the headset, so using another set of headphones may just turn out impossible, unless you manage to somehow find a suitable adapter. We unfortunately couldn't, and that is the reason we were unable to perform our audio quality test on this device. But moving back to the player, we have to say that it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. The equalizers do deserve attention, as they perform very well and have nice graphic visualization. As with Nokia 7500 Prism, the selected equalizer has an almost instant effect without the usual couple-of-seconds lag. Nokia 6500 classic has only one loudspeaker located on its rear cover, right next to the camera. We did already mention that it is among the loudest we tried, though. Surprisingly enough, it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back on an even surface such as a desk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no FM radio on Nokia 6500 classic, so if you get bored with the music player all you can do is turn the video on. The video player is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and improves video watching experience greatly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery could have done better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No significant changes in the gallery were made with Nokia 6500 classic. We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models but, as it's used as a file manager at the same time, it is understandable. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is quite slow and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help. The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter however offers very limited options, but considering the fact that there are very few users that actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders but we still believe that gallery on Series 40 could be improved a lot. That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery of these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A mediocre camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When speaking about multimedia capabilities, the camera is one of the most important things to mention. Nokia 6500 classic is armed with a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. Typical of Series 40, camera settings are not the richest around but still enough for this shooter. They include white balance settings, three quality settings going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras. The flash can be forced to on, regardless of the light conditions, and used as fill flash. Naturally, an automatic mode for the LED is also available. In terms of performance however, we weren't that impressed with its performance. It is probably a little better than the LED flash we found on the Nokia 7500 Prism but still fails to achieve decent quality pictures on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is not the best we have seen either. Frankly, it is not even near average level. It has no lens cover and is only a little recessed to avoid scratches. We have already mentioned that this seems not quite enough for us but Nokia have decided so and we can't do anything about it. The lack of a dedicated camera button is also another real downer when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable, especially when shooting in landscape mode, to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose. And a picture has been taken, the function of this button turns to delete, which we found to be most annoying. It will rarely lead to accidental deleting of a precious picture, as confirmation is still required, but the chance of such a thing to happen is not completely ruled out. Photo quality is below average; in favorable weather decent images can be produced, sharp enough, with less blown colors. The noise levels are high in areas with no detail like the sky for example. Given the absence of autofocus, you'd rather not take a picture of a closely situated objects or text, as they will surely be blurred. Text is only legible if captured from a distance. Finally we need to warn you about the camera speed. This one is among the slowest we have tried recently. It will take ages to save a picture at the highest resolution and that stretches the shot-to-shot time considerably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disappointment is the QCIF video capture resolution of the Nokia 6500 classic's camera. The fact that Nokia 6233 manages video recording in VGA resolution and costs about half the classic's asking price does speak for itself. The length of videos in 3GP format is only limited by the free memory available. Zooming is also available but that cannot stop us from calling the video capturing a sounding failure. This may as well be true for the overall camera experience for that matter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: USB on focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is another aspect of Nokia 6500 where you could expect more. The main focus here is the USB connectivity and it is really seamless. On the other hand the microUSB is not as widespread as the miniUSB, but this may just be how the future is shaping. Upon connection of the USB cable, it prompts you to select the connection mode. You can then alternate these modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer. The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile, which allows stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 6500 classic supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS where 3G support is missing. There is no infrared port on the device and no memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring information.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 classic has an integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages. No significant changes in functionality have been made and it is identical to the one used in Nokia 6300. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set at the smallest font, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browser faces serious competition from another brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java application. The latter is pre-installed and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 6500 classic. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. The browsing experience can hardly be compared to the one on Nokia's smartphones but still is at a more than decent level. We nonetheless couldn't help wishing the screen was a little bigger on this occasion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: time-proven performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer brings no novelties either, and, frankly, it needs none. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length limit is 3000 characters. The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking. This time however, the calculator is not as elaborate as in Nokia 6300 for example. It offers fewer mathematical functions but at least the essentials are still there for the user.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 classic comes with a relatively small number of preinstalled applications outside the organizer. The sensor application has been dropped and so has been the size converter. Luckily, the regular unit converter remains and is consistently useful. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other included application is the world clock, which allows checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks. And finally, the applications that complete the content on Nokia 6500 classic are the Yahoo search and the Download application. While the first greatly facilitates the access to the popular search engine, the latter connects you directly to Nokia's download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably appreciate the preinstalled content, as it includes five games. The first one we don't come across too often in the mobile phones we review - the Backgammon II game is the Java interpretation of the popular board game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snake is essential to Nokia phones, so the presence of Snake III in Nokia 6500 classic is no surprise at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The High roller casino is a game that will meet the appreciation of gambling lovers, as it includes some of the most popular gambling games, such as Texas Hold'em Poker and Blackjack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two games in line are the sport simulation Golf Tour and the Java version of the popular Japanese game Sudoku. All the games have decent graphics and are comparatively easy to play. Leaving the tiny keys aside, that is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When looks come first<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The question at the end of our Nokia 6500 classic review is whether a seductive look can secure a lenient verdict. It is a truly great looking handset. Well, except for the not so rare moments when it ends up covered with fingerprints. Functionality however is not that much of a leap forward to justify the asking price. If you find the Nokia 6500 classic so hard to resist you might end up buying it. But in all other cases the reasonable decision will be to look elsewhere. For the same price you will buy two Nokia 6300 phones and even save some money for extra memory. Maybe this will change with time and prices will eventually level out. At this stage however, there seem to be very few arguments in favor of purchasing the Nokia 6500 classic. At least one of them though, seems to be a strong enough motivation: looks. And who says all buys should be reasonable? Anyway, the Nokia 6500 classic is on offer and it's your money.</paragraph>
