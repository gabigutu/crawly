			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM phones have an aura of budget-mindedness, which makes it hard to find a handset that goes the extra mile. The Oppo R819 has an impressively slim and light build, a good screen and camera, and operates in the busy but somewhat uninspiring dual-SIM midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R819 is only 7.3mm thick and weighs a meager 110g, which gives it an in-hand feel that's impressive in any price range. The positive impressions continue with the bright, sharp screen. 720p on a 4.7" diagonal used to be flagship specs last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Same goes for the camera - the 8MP BSI image sensor sits behind a 5-element F/2.0 aperture lens and can shoot 1080p video. The Mediatek MT6589 chipset is becoming quite popular and while it won't scare the high-end Snapdragons, it should offer good enough performance and solid battery life. Plus it's coupled with a very recent Android build - 4.2 Jelly Bean - so it should go quite smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest omissions that can trip up the R819 on its way to your pocket are all connectivity features. The sealed battery and non-expandable storage are to be expected in a slim phone, even more so considering phone makers are keener than ever on locking up both storage and battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are legitimate uses of multiple SIM cards, even in the day and age of "unlimited everything" plans. Those plans are pricy for one - an extra card can give you data or texts a lot cheaper. Or travelling abroad you might want to keep your SIM active for emergencies, but put in a local pre-paid card for most calls. Or keep the work phone card on you during weekends, without carrying a second handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has all the right things on its CV, but let's see how it does in an extended interview - jump over to the next page to see if it lived up to the expectations set up by the Find 5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R819 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 measures 136.5 x 68 x 7.3mm and weighs 110g. For comparison's sake, an HTC Desire 600 (with a smaller, 4.5" screen) measures 134.8 x 67 x 9.3mm and weighs 130g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has a very standard Android phone design - a rounded rectangle with a silver strip running around its side, a big screen and three capacitive keys on the front. Unlike the Find 5, which was an attractive phone, the R819 is pretty ordinary. Nothing wrong with that, but you'll probably have people asking you what kind of Samsung or LG it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you notice when you pick up the Oppo R819 is how thin and light it is. It's just the right size to fit in the hand comfortably too. However, the bezels around the 4.7" screen are fairly thick compared to most other phones - by no means huge, but could've definitely been smaller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Oppo R819 is made of a glossy plastic with a subtle diamond pattern to it. It's not the best plastic we've seen, but we like it better than Samsung's favorite hyperglaze finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This back cover is actually removable, but there's not much you can do - the 2,000mAh battery is right there, but it's attached with cables and there' no microSD card slot. At least you can easily change the back panel yourself if it gets damaged.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has a 4.7" LCD display of 720p resolution and 312ppi. It's sharp, as sharp as a flagship from last season, and sharper than most of the dual-SIM phones on offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo R819 screen under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has very good viewing angles with only minor shifts in contrast at extreme tilt. Colors are vivid and the high contrast makes for fine image quality, better than some of the competitors that passed by recently (HTC Desire 600 dual sim, Samsung Galaxy S4 mini duos). It's very good compared to midrange droids in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, the display is bright - we kept it at under half brightness most of the time and that was quite enough. But you can push it to full brightness to help the sunlight legibility. The display is on the reflective side, so visibility under direct sunlight suffers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The proximity and ambient light sensors are on the side of the earpiece above the screen. A little to the right is the 2MP front-facing camera, which has a wide 88° lens that really makes a difference in video chatting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are three capacitive buttons - Menu, Home and Back. Oppo uses this arrangement (so does Samsung), even though on-screen buttons have been preferred since ICS and the Menu button has been largely replaced by the app switcher button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Oppo R819 holds the Power/Lock key, which isn't needed strictly speaking. You can wake the phone with a double tap and lock it with the provided Lock Now shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the microSIM card tray, which has to be opened with a SIM eject tool (though the curve towards the back allowed us to pry it open with a fingernail). If you're wondering where the second SIM goes, the R819 uses a single tray for both cards. The innermost card is SIM1, the outer is SIM2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing about this design is that you can slide out only half of the tray, pop in a new card and push it back in. The phone will detect the new card, show you what the current settings are (preferred card for calls, texts, that sort of thing). It will then prompt you to restart (cycling Airplane mode didn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Oppo R819 just holds the volume rocker. On top there's the 3.5mm audio jack. There's a thin silver strip running around the sides of the phone and is really the only decorative element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone is a microUSB port (with no USB OTG functionality) and the main mic. The secondary mic is on the back, near the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the camera, it's very near the top edge of the back and protrudes slightly so you should be careful not to put a finger in front or get it scratched. Oppo is bragging about its 5-element lens design with UV coating and blue glass (to filter out IR light). The sensor is Back Side Illuminated and the lens has an F/2.0 aperture, which should help it in low-light shots. There's an LED flash for that too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grille is near the bottom of the back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has a 2,000mAh non-removable battery - not bad for such a thin phone, plus some competing dual-SIMs have smaller batteries. What really makes a difference for the battery life, however, is the efficient modem - power draw during standby and in a call is very low, so the R819 battery loses little charge during the night and over a few hours of calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset and bright screen proved to be more power hungry and the web browsing and video playback times are less impressive, though (but still not bad).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface with ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 came with Android 4.2.1 out of the box, but if the idea of yet another customized Android does not sound appealing, you'll be glad to hear Oppo has a stock Android option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Oppo R819 flaunting its UI on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we understand the reservations about Android skins, some of them have value added features that are not available in AOSP. Oppo has tweaked the UI to the aesthetic popular with other China-based manufacturers and has thrown in a good deal of dials and toggles too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts at the lockscreen. The default lockscreen shows the wallpaper, time and weather forecast and offers a camera shortcut. Basically, it's a skinned version of the vanilla lockscreen. There are two more options available out of the box - GlassBoard (a simple swipe to unlock screen like the Oppo Find 5 had) and Card Unlock (which shows music playback info and has more shortcuts). It's great that each lockscreen has its own animated preview, so you can see what it looks like and how it behaves before applying it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 supports the double-tap-to-wake-up gesture, which means you can unlock the phone without using the Power/Lock key (which is a lot more convenient if the phone is laying on the table).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a feature called Easy Stay (you can say it's a Smart feature), which will keep the screen on while the front-facing camera can see your face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen too is a custom job, but keeps very close to the accepted standard. There's a 4 x 4 grid of shortcuts with an extra row at the bottom for a dock. The homescreen has widgets too and Oppo has provided a nice selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add up to 9 homescreen panes, when most custom launchers top out at 7. You can re-arrange them and delete the ones you don't need, through the popular overview mode you trigger by a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, there's a fixed homescreen pane, which handles music playback. It pops up automatically when you plug in a pair of headphones, a lot like Page Buddy on Samsung's TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the Menu button brings out a tabbed tray with customizations for the homescreen. The first one just holds the widgets and the second one is for the wallpaper. The next two are more interesting - one changes the transition effect between the homescreen panes and the other is where you choose the themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has settled on a specific look for the icons: squares with rounded corners. Apps that don't have such an icon will be placed on a grey rounded square in an attempt to unify the look of all shortcuts. Google icons (Play Store, Gmail, etc.) are exempt from that, but there's a curious option called "Beautify icon," which swaps out some those icons with custom ones and places the others on the same grey background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish Oppo took the time to at least do icons for all of the apps, for example, why does Google+ get a custom icon when Gmail does not? Overall the solution is not as good as some icon packs you can get from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that was slightly disappointing is that shortcuts and widgets don't move out of the way automatically as you rearrange items on the homescreen, which is an ICS feature and really should have been enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you are a fan of customizations you'll want to check out NearMe Themes and NearMe Wallpapers. This is where you can get more themes and wallpapers that work with the Oppo R819 launcher. Each theme brings a custom set of icons to keep the cohesive look but suffers from the same issue as the default theme - no custom icons for anything but Oppo's apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has a line of quick toggles. A tap on the edit button lets you hide/show and rearrange toggles. If you have more than the screen can hold, the rest go offscreen and you need to scroll to reach them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a brightness control that toggles low, half, full brightness and auto mode. There's also a Kill all apps button. A long press on some toggles will bring up its respective settings entry. An interesting note on the screen autorotation toggle - it can be on or off, but an extra option from the Settings menu lets you toggle the animation effect too. We prefer to keep the animation off as it's faster, but it looks better with the animation on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen is a dock. You can have shortcuts or folders here, you can even move the app drawer shortcut (but not remove it from the dock altogether). The dock has four shortcuts (Dialer, Messaging, Chrome and App drawer) by default, but you can actually fit a fifth one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is pretty simple - it has horizontally scrollable pages, each a 4 x 4 grid of shortcuts or folders. The dock at the bottom of the screen is visible in the drawer too. A small "NEW" tag marks newly installed apps that haven't been launched yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragging a shortcut to the homescreen doesn't work the way you're used to - the default action is to rearrange shortcuts, you have to drag it over the "Drag app to homescreen" area that appears at the bottom instead. This just slows down the most commonly used function - dragging shortcuts onto the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is yet another element of Android that Oppo has customized. This time it is pretty restrained, just a Kill all apps button and a Google Now shortcut with an indicator of how much RAM is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the Settings have been tweaked. They got a new paint job to match the rest of the UI and the various settings have been organized into tabs - General, Sound, Display and Security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciated was the Boot manager. No, it's not a tool for dual-booting, but it shows a list of all apps that run on startup and lets you disable some of them to speed up the startup process. We wish stock Android had this, heck, we wish Windows did (it does, but it's not quite as accessible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool tool lets you decide which apps will be allowed to run in the background. There's more - you can lock access to some apps and the phone will require a security pattern (like the one on the lockscreen) to launch the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Oppo R819 runs smoothly and we found the customization options to be quite good. However, the whole thing has a strong TouchWiz vibe, which may be a turnoff.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One problem Google Now has on the Oppo R819 is that there's no gesture shortcut to launch it, you can't long press a button for it, you have to use the Google Search widget or the shortcut in the custom app switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 uses a Mediatek MT6589 chipset with a quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU (clocked at 1.2GHz), 1GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX544 GPU. Those don't sound like killer specs, but should feel right at home in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance isn't great - it's comparable to that of the old Cortex-A9 core. That's typically no match for Krait cores, but at least Mediatek fits 4 of the A7s, which should compensate in the next couple of benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack puts the R819 very near the bottom of the chart, but there are last year's flagships like the Galaxy S III, One X and Optimus 4X HD keeping it company. Geekbench 2 meanwhile puts the former kings further up the chart, but the HTC One mini is barely faster than the Oppo here (while it was much faster in Linpack).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu puts the whole system to the test (CPU, GPU, RAM and storage) and places the Oppo R819 close to the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini and ahead of the One mini. Those are some of the hottest midrangers from two of the biggest Android vendors, so well done Oppo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running GLBenchmark at 1080p offscreen proved to be fruitless - the single-core PowerVR SGX544 is clocked relatively low in the MT6589 chipset and just can't do 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel runs at screen resolution - 720p in this case - and we set it to High Quality. The Oppo R819 hit just under 51fps, which is very close to the Adreno 320-powered LG Optimus G and ahead of the Samsung Galaxy S III and Oppo Find 5. This means 3D games are more than playable on the R819 and there's always the option to move to High Performance (or equivalent) setting if a new game proves too heavy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Relatively low single-core performance hurts the JavaScript speed, but the score is very close to decent performers in this category, so even JavaScript-intensive pages should render okay on the R819.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For overall HTML5 performance, the Oppo R819 comes within reach of the Galaxy S4 mini and the HTC One mini in BrowserMark 2, while Vellamo places it further down, sandwiched between the LG Optimus G and Nexus 4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mediatek set out to make a budget chipset and already have a solid portfolio of phones powered by the MT6589. This should mean better developer support. As for daily use, it offers good enough performance on all fronts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 is a dual-SIM phone. There are two call buttons labeled SIM1 and SIM2, which can be renamed. You can also choose which SIM gets priority for calls and which is used for data connectivity. The phone can also automatically set up call forwarding, in case you get a call on one SIM while talking on the other. Note that only one SIM can be connected to a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer uses a tabbed interface, not unlike the stock app. The first tab is the dialer, then there's the contact list, favorites and groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app does smart dial, but only matches the phone numbers and not the contact's names, which is the less useful option. The button at the bottom left lets you quickly save the number you've typed in to a new or existing contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Notify on connect - the phone can vibrate or ring (or both) when a call connects. You can also build a list of texts to send when you reject a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has a couple of useful gestures too - flip to mute and auto answer (which answers an incoming call when you lift the handset up). This same gesture can be used to automatically turn off the loudspeaker during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R819 will also vibrate when you pick it up and there are missed notifications. Overall, there are more than a few features nicked from TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker of the Oppo R819 scored a Average mark - it's far from the loudest phoen around, but at least the vibration is good. You can read more about the loudspeaker test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook itself is pretty standard, save for the custom skin. It shows an alphabetized list of visible contacts with an alphabet index on the right if you want to jump to a specific letter (regular search is available too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. A star next to the contact's photo and name can be used to mark them as favorite and there are call and text shortcuts at the bottom. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Earlier, we said visible contacts because you can hide contacts with no phone numbers or contacts from specific groups (e.g. ones that were synced from a specific email service).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all conversations organized into threads, with two buttons at the bottom (Search and Compose). There's a small number next to the textbox signifying the SIM card to be used. You can tap it to toggle the other SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each conversation consists of messages displayed in speech bubbles, similar to a chat program. It's a bit annoying that the compose box starts off as a single line, but it will grow to up to twelve as you type in more text. A character/message counter shows up when you're 10 letters away from the 160 limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual messages can be locked to prevent accidental deletion. Delivery reports can be activated and you can backup and import messages. Scheduled messages are also an option - you enter the recipient, message text and pick a date in the future. Messages can even be sent daily or only on select days (good if you need to message an automated service every day, e.g. to park your car).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also backup and restore messages to files, so you don't lose them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items. A great option if you're being spammed is Delete all emails from sender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view, with each message color coded according to the account it came from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts and Google+ Messenger are available out of the box for text and video chatting over the Internet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Go keyboard for text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big 4.7" screen offers a big on-screen keyboard and there's still enough left over for the app. Keys on the keyboard get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing. You can customize the font size for the keyboard for both portrait and landscape mode so you can tweak the size of the keyboard. Also, you can choose if the keyboard goes fullscreen when entering text or if it just overlays the app (again, there are separate settings for landscape and portrait modes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is a Swipe-like mode - you just slide your finger over the keys rather than tap them individually. You can also use offline voice typing as an alternative too, one of the perks of using Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard can learn new words and if you've built up a dictionary of them you can back it up and restore it later. Other tweaks include sound and vibrate on press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard also offers a long list of predefined smilies and other characters (hearts, music notes, card suites, etc.) and you can even switch between different styles of smilies - :), :-), :^), :o).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you really want the world to know you're under 12 years old, you can enable the so-called Fantasy text mode. It's actually an automatic leet text translation with tons of custom "fonts", which gives results like this: 7HI5 I5 N07 4 600D ID34.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've recognized these features, you'll know that this is in fact just Go Keyboard, which you can download from the Play Store. Honestly, we prefer to install the Google Keyboard.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo R819 is a custom job, not too different from the vanilla app. The default view is Camera roll, but you can switch to a view of all folders that contain images. You can hide folders you don't want. Unfortunately, there's no web album integration either (so, no "Make available offline" option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an individual image, you can swipe left and right to navigate between images. A filmstrip of thumbnails at the bottom of the screen allows for faster navigation. A curios and helpful feature lets you rotate an image with two fingers, which is great if the screen autorotation is disabled or acting up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features here are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it delete it, rename it or rotate it. The details offer more info than most other galleries, including EXIF info (things like focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a more advanced editor too, the stock Android one. Light adjustments let you bring out the shadows or the highlights, you can apply effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and so on. Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of the box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP servers, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby Mobile and Dirac<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 comes with a bespoke music player loaded with Dirac HD sound enhancements. The UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a list of all music, a list of artists, albums and playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art. You can swipe between the two, the music controls are always visible. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them over the album art, though that didn't work for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. The Dirac audio works only with headphones plugged in and has no options, it's either on or off. There's no equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the music player successfully played a 16-bit FLAC file (24-bit didn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on, the notification area features the album art and track info for the current song along with the basic playback controls. The default lockscreen lacks these controls but the other two preloaded lockscreens do have them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom homescreen features an animated record player that serves as eye can be used to control the music player. You start and stop the playback by moving the tonearm on or off the record and change tracks by swiping up or down. There's also a button to toggle the repeat modes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 features a stereo FM radio receiver with RDS support. The first time you start it, it will scan for available cannels and you can star your favorites. The phone can output the sound either through the headset or through the loudspeaker, but the headset needs to be connected in either case (it acts as the antenna).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with great codec support, Pop up play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is pretty basic, it just displays a list of all video files on the device. It can sort the list by name, time, date and size. There's a search function and you can just use the file browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has no problems playing 1080p videos in every format we tried - AVIs with DivX and XviD, MKVs, MPG, MOV and MP4. The audio codec support was great too, supporting both Dolby Digital and DTS, which are common stumbling blocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a separate brightness slider, but no Dirac audio option here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung Galaxy flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no resize option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to play the video on your TV, you can activate the Wi-Fi Display function, but you'll need a compatible HDMI dongle. Alternatively, you can use DLNA, but there's no MHL TV-Out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-balanced audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its lower standing in the pecking order, the Oppo R819 doesn't do any worse than the Find 5 in terms of audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the R819 has an advantage over its rival when plugged into an active external amplifier. The volume levels are just as high, but the mid-range Oppo smartphone has better frequency response and slightly cleaner overall output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the R819 loses more of its brilliance when you plug in a pair of headphones, experiencing increased stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion - it's not too bad but it's not perfect either. Volume levels drop a bit too, but they are still average at worst. Still the overall showing by the R819 is quite solid and should suffice to please everyone but the most demanding audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera deserves better software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 features an 8MP camera with a BSI image sensor and a 5-element lens with an F/2.0 aperture. There's an LED flash to help out with low-light shots and a 2MP front-facing camera with a wide 88° field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is a custom job by Oppo and is very simple - too simple. There's a single screen, which serves both the still and the video camera and is cropped to 16:9, even though still shots come out as 4:3. This might make framing difficult.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For controls you get the still and video shutter keys (you can use the volume rocker to snap photos), a front/back camera toggle, flash mode toggle (including fill light), along with a mode button and a settings buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modes include Auto, which detects the scene, HDR, sweep panorama, rewind (which snaps several photos and lets you pick the best one), beauty shot and sunset. In the settings you can toggle geo-tagging, shutter sound and a few other settings, but not resolution - like on the iPhone, you're stuck at max resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Burst mode is available (just press and hold the shutter key) and will snap up to 100 photos at 5 per second. There's touch focus too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Oppo R819 came with a Lomo camera app preinstalled. It does several effects with live preview of four of them at a time (a nice way to show off that quad-core CPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Oppo R819 camera is okay for an 8MP shooter, though we've definitely seen better. There's decent amounts of fine detail, though the noise reduction both leaves noise and smears out the detail in some places. Color rendering is conservative - not oversaturated and mostly accurate, though there seems to be something off about the red channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we experienced a few occasions where the R819 had missed the focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available, but it's not great. It's slow to snap a photo and it doesn't align the different expositions all that good. Worse still, it really drives up the noise. It brings out a lot of detail in the shadows but does practically nothing for the highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 may not be the best 8MP shooter around, but it gives mid-rangers a run for their money. While there are plenty of 8MP shooters in our photo quality comparison tool, keep in mind that dual-SIM phones are fairly rare.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera saves the day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is virtually identical to the still camera UI. Touch focus is available during video recording and you can snap photos too (though they come out at just under 1080p resolution, basically a screenshot of the video).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot at up to 1080p and 30fps and stored in MP4 files with about 25Mbps bitrate, some of the highest we've seen. Sound is recorded in stereo at 128Kbps and 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high bitrate pays off - the videos from the Oppo R819 have plenty of fine detail and very little noise. They are smooth and color rendering is once again on the accurate side, save for the slightly washed out red channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample we uploaded to YouTube. You can download an untouched video here - 1080p@30fps (0:06s, 21.4MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the still camera, the 1080p video camera of the Oppo R819 is one of the better ones we've seen. There's plenty of competition in our video quality comparison tool, from both mid-rangers and high-end phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM connectivity, but no LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has quad-band 2G and tri or tri-band 3G connectivity (depending on the market) with HSPA+. It's a dual-SIM, dual-standby phone, but only one SIM card can be connected to a 3G network (and only one can be used for data). The big omission here is LTE, which might be a deal breaker for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is handled by dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0. The microUSB port can be used in mass storage or MTP mode, just charge, share the phone's Internet connection or connect to the Oppo PC suit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 also has a Wi-Fi display option, which can output the screen image to a compatible device over HDMI (but there's no MHL functionality).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Chrome with data compression<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers, for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office doc editor with cloud integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 comes with Kingsoft Office out of the box and it's the full version that can create and edit files too. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint files (97, 2007 and 2010 docs are supported) and can view PDFs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editors are quite capable - the Word editor can do complex text formatting, create tables, while the Excel editor has full support for editing formulas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better still, there are plenty of sharing options. Kingsoft Office supports Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and WebDAV / FTP out of the box for syncing files, you can email files and use Shareplay. Shareplay is a presentation tool that sends the file to all devices connected to the session and lets you move between slides, highlight items and so on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has iOS touch with a dynamic icon that shows the day of the month. There are three views - Daily, Weekly and Monthly. The Memos tab in the app is equivalent to Agenda view - it shows a list of all events, past and future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar and you can selectively hide calendars to keep things tidy. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is a just a skinned version of the stock app - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NearMe Notes app comes pre-installed. The app lets you create complex notes with text, images and hand drawn notes. The gimmick here is that each note has a location associated with it and only notes that are "close by" will be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a weather app too, which shows the weather with various videos for the various weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app (that's virtually identical to the HTC app), a sound recorder and a 3D compass.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A rising star in smartphones, Oppo's been dabbling in dual-SIM phones since late last year, but the R819 is its most convincing attempt. The phone can challenge the dual-SIM offerings from more prominent makers like Samsung, LG, HTC and Sony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standout features of the Oppo R819 are the light build, excellent screen and good camera. The chipset handles Android 4.2.2 smoothly and Oppo's custom tweaks add a lot of useful stuff, even though they hardly help the looks. The best part is, if you don't quite fancy Oppo's Color ROM, stock Android ROM will keep you in your happy Holo-themed place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R819 isn't going to win you over with its looks alone, but that's mostly because the Find 5 has raised the bar pretty high. In this price range the solid build quality and nice materials are more than good enough. Battery life is good for the class, too, but we still wish the battery was user replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Established makers have a few alternatives to the R819, but they all involve more than a few compromises. Samsung and HTC have dual-SIM versions of their flagship phones, though they are not really direct competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini duos fits the bill better - it has a more powerful chipset, better connectivity with LTE and NFC, more software features (most of the R819's features are TouchWiz-inspired), plus expandable storage. The 4.3" qHD Super AMOLED is no match for the sharp, bright 4.7" screen of the Oppo, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim has a 4.5" qHD screen and is powered by a slower chipset (with Cortex-A5 cores and Adreno 203 GPU). Its 8MP camera can't record 1080p videos and, despite being thicker and heavier than the Oppo, it has a smaller battery (1,860mAh).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 600 dual sim</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the 5" Sony Xperia C. The big screen isn't particularly sharp at qHD resolution, but the phone uses the same chipset, has an 8MP / 1080p-capable camera and expandable storage. It's big (141mm tall, weighing 153g), but at least it packs a robust 2,390mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real competition comes from phones from the home market. Xiaomi has a 4.7" 720p phone with the same chipset and similar specs, the Hongmi. Then there's the Lenovo P780 with a 5" 720p screen and a massive 4,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Xiaomi Hongmi ? Lenovo P780</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indian maker Micromax and its A116 Canvas HD might also have a say here. The smartphone has a 5" 720p screen and the same Mediatek chipset, though its 8MP camera can only capture 720p. The Canvas 4 swaps out the camera for a 13MP / 1080p one, but changes little else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Micromax A116 Canvas HD ? Micromax Canvas 4 A210</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 measures up very favorably against such competition, especially when you take into account that none of these can limbo as low as 7.3mm slim and 110g of weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only remaining issue is one of availability - the Oppo R819 is on pre-order in Europe, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan, which is much wider than we originally expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This gives the Oppo R819 a fighting chance, it's an excellent dual-SIM phone with midrange specs. We just wish Oppo had brought in the designer who did the Find 5.</paragraph>
