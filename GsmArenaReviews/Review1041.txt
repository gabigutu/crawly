			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Failing to react to market tendencies has been an Achilles' heel of sorts for Sony in the past. Joining the dual-core and to quad-core parties late over the past two years has caused the once mighty smartphone maker to slide down in ranks and came dangerously close to the role of an also-run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It appears that the Japanese giant may have finally learned its lesson though, and this time around they are among the first to jump onto the 5" 1080p bandwagon. But the Xperia Z is more than just a pretty face - with a Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset and a glass-covered back, this is also a properly powered and properly built flagship powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we start with a quick rundown of the Sony Xperia Z hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The specs sheet seems to leave no boxes unchecked and even the most demanding of geeks will struggle to find something wrong with it. The Sony Xperia Z is less than half a millimeter wider than, say, the Samsung Galaxy S III, yet it packs a larger battery, a screen of more than twice the resolution and a chipset fully capable of handling all those pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if that's not enough for you, the Sony is willing to throw in dust and water resistance on the Z, so you don't have to worry about a spilled glass of wine ruining your evening. There's also a new 13MP camera and HDR 1080p video recording which the cameraphone enthusiasts can look forward to. It seems then, that with the latest Sony flagship it comes down to a question of not whether it is better than other smartphones on the market, but by how much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As long as everything works as promised, the Sony Xperia Z has all the necessary ingredients to lay a proper claim to the smartphone throne. Let's find out how it all comes together at first glance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since initial rumors of the Sony Xperia Z and its 5" screen surfaced, many have expressed concerns that the smartphone will be impossible to handle, even before having seen it. However, once more details started to appear, it became clear that Sony has done an excellent job of minimizing the bezel and the Xperia Z is only about a millimeter wider than the 2012 flagships. They also managed to keep the weight under control as the Xperia Z tips the scales at the perfectly reasonable 146g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it's a tad taller than the Galaxy S III or the One X, but it's certainly not unmanageable. And if over 50 million pockets and palms were big enough for the flagships of old, then the Sony Xperia Z has nothing to worry about - particularly when you take into account that the tradeoff is a gorgeous fullHD screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is instantly recognizable as a Sony device with its sharply angular design, but it departs from the arc-inspired back of its predecessor, instead featuring a more modern looking flat back. There's no denying that the smartphone is a real looker - the glass covered front and back panels go along excellently with the rubberized edges and the glossy blue plastic bits on the sides. It's a handset that you'd be proud to be seen with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several flaps on the sides that not only helped the Sony Xperia Z achieve its IP57 certification, but also conform to its design. There are no ugly gaps and openings to spoil the smartphone's profiles - it all looks consistent and stylish. The only exception is the rather big lanyard eyelet at the bottom right corner, but even that doesn't look too out of place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of materials has just one negative side - with twice the amount of glass used, there's that much more area to cover in smudges and fingerprints. Indeed the Xperia Z turns into a greasy mess quite quickly, causing it to lose some of its brilliance. Fortunately, the good news is that cleaning it isn't particularly hard. Besides, you can always opt for the white version, which will certainly make fingerprints harder to spot than on our black review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality seems excellent as well - there are no squeaks, creaks or any other disturbing sounds to be heard when handling the smartphone and it generally feels quite sturdy. We can't do a proper test of the back panel scratch resistance, but Sony claims it's the same as the one on the front so it should be quite durable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z has a pretty standard set of functional elements above its screen. The earpiece is flanked by the front-facing camera on one side, and the ambient light and proximity sensors alongside the LED status light on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Xperia Z relies on virtual navigation buttons rather than hardware ones, the microphone is all you get at the bottom. While the mic does reside under a grill identical to that of the earpiece, the smartphone doesn't have front-mounted stereo-speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, the sole loudspeaker is mounted near the bottom edge of the Xperia Z's right side. It's joined by the volume rocker and the smartphone's signature power/lock key, as well as the microSIM card slot. The SIM slot is hidden under one of the plastic flaps we mentioned above. Sadly, there's no dedicated camera key here - that's a privilege reserved for the Xperia ZL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you get another plastic lid with the 3.5mm audio jack hiding underneath. While the cover prevents dust and dirt accumulation (in addition of keeping water out), it does have a somewhat negative effect on its accessibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the MHL-enabled microUSB with USB host support and the microSD card slot. The dock connector resides underneath the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the smartphone is completely bereft of functional elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, turning our eyes to the back we spot the 13 megapixel camera lens, the LED flash and the secondary microphone. The primary use of this microphone is noise cancelling, but it also enables the Sony Xperia Z to capture video with stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the back cover sits a 2330 mAh battery that should keep the new Sony flagship going for up to 14 hours of talk-time or 530 hours of stand-by. Those are some impressive numbers, but we'll have to complete our battery testing routine to know how the real-life performance stacks up. Here's hoping it performs as advertised as the battery is non-removable, and to extend the Xperia Z's power autonomy you'd have to either carry one of those awkward portable chargers or slip on a juice case and ruin both its slick looks and slim waistline.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We come to the main event of the hardware show. The Sony Xperia Z 5" 1080p display is definitely its strongest selling point and with a pixel density of 441ppi you can see what all the fuss is about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have already mentioned this a few times, but let's go over it once again just in case. You can actually see the sharpness advantage over the 720p displays of the 2012 flagships with a naked eye. However, the difference is by no means as big as when smartphones departed the WVGA screens and started passing the Retina barrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z also comes with the second version of the company's Mobile Bravia Engine, which should improve its performance for video playback and image browsing. Thanks to that and the immense resolution, the Xperia Z has easily the best smartphone display the Japanase have produced so far. It is also the least reflective so far, which helps it perform much bettter in bright sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>However, the screen is by no means perfect. First of all its viewing angles aren't really great. They are a step forward compared to the Xperia T, but a very minor one. In that area Sony still has a lot of work before it catches up with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More disturbingly, the display has rather poor contrast for a flagship unit and not really inspiring colors. As testified by the measurements in our dedicated test it comes nowhere near the standard of its main competitors and it even fared worse than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've asked Sony to send us another unit so we can double check if this is not some sort of unit-specific issue we are experiencing here. So we'll be able to repeat the test next week and we'll make sure to update you if the results come up different.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia gets first taste of Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is Sony's first smartphone to run on Android Jelly Bean out of the box. The version ticking inside is 4.1.1, while Sony promises to bring the 4.2 update shortly after the smartphone's launch. Meanwhile Google already pushed a 4.2.2 version to the Nexus family, so we hope Sony focuses on that one instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called Project Butter, which aims to keep UI animations' framerate at a consistent 60 fps, is one of the key novelties of Jelly Bean. Combined with the powerful quad-core chipset and the latest generation graphics, the Xperia Z gives you as smooth a ride throughout the UI as you can expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia Z flagship in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The Xperia Z now gives you the option to change the number of homescreen panes (by adding more or removing some of the default 5) and even select any of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone - add widget, shortcuts to apps, change the wallpaper and change the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it to the add to homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Unfortunately the widgets in the Xperia Z do not resize or re-arrange automatically, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no overview mode as it was with previous Sony Xperia smartphones. Instead, you get the homescreen edit menu when you do the familiar pinching gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has been redesigned too. It uses a new cool default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and now features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. For some reason, the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome task manager we met with in the Xperia T is also here. It lets you go to the recently opened apps as well as remove them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z uses a Snapdragon APQ8064 S4 Pro chipset, which is the fastest to currently power an Android phone. It packs four Krait CPU cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. That same chipset ticks inside the Oppo Find 5, Google Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G and the HTC DROID DNA / Butterfly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait cores are fast, no doubt about that - two of them were coming only slightly short of a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU and four make up a real beast. And the Xperia Z doesn't disappoint. It comes up on top in Benchmark Pi (which is all about single-threaded performance) and it's also on the top in Linpack (which focuses on multithreading).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clean sweep continued with consecutive victories in the three compound benchmarks AnTuTu, Quadrant and GeekBench 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Xperia Z didn't disappoint, scoring as high as the Oppo Find 5 and the Nexus 4, and a tad better than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The benchmark was run at the High Quality setting and yet the Xperia Z once again topped posting an amazing result and was pushing against the 60fps limitation of the screen for almost the entire test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were almost stating to suspect that the Xperia Z is an unbeatable benchmark champion, but the browser trials broke its streak. Of course that's more down to the Chrome browser than the actual computing prowess of the smartphone, but the SunSpider score of 1906ms was rather uninspiring. The Nexus 4 doesn't do too well here either - unlike its desktop counterpart, Chrome for Android just isn't very good at this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BrowserMark 2 things started to look up again - the Xperia Z took the second place there - outrun only by the LG Optimus G, which has the same chipset but lowerscreen resolution (so, each time the phone redraws a web page, there's less than half the number of pixels to deal with). The Xperia Z also took the second place in the HTML5-test Vellamo, beaten only by the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum things up, Sony has managed to extract more performance from the four Krait cores than any manufacturer to use this chipset. The Adreno 320 GPU does equally well - it manages playable framerates using a real-world 3D engine at FullHD resolution. It's hardly a surprise then, that the overall user experience with this one is smooth as butter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Album is your gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z comes with the new Sony gallery, called Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with cool animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded - although it identified our version of The Mask not as the famous Jim Carrey flick, but rather a horror movie from 1961 by the same name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z did a very good job with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD, even MKV. The only exception was AC3 audio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video editing app called Movie Studio is bundled too. It lets you edit video, images, and audio together (both imported from files as well as recorded/taken by the device itself), using a variety of cool transitions. You can then export the resulting project into a video file that you can share using the Z's generous connectivity features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman plays the music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it got even more sound enhancement options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However die-hard audiophiles might prefer additional players, which sport a 10-band or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and adds bookmarks to stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Google Music is onboard as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera with lots of bells and whistles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels. However, if you use the default Superior auto mode, you get 12 MP 4000 x 3000 shots instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and regular mode with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode and what not. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From what our experience so far shows, though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are a photography enthusiast or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia Z camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture and HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video. This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is capable of capturing 1080p video footage at 30fps, which is on par with most modern day smartphones. However, as a nice extra touch the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it only the second one to do so after the Oppo Find 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia Z is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 1 megapixel of resolution. That's less than half the resolution of the individual frames in the video itself and not really good for much. Given that last year's flagships could capture full res stills during video recording, what the Xperia Z offers is inexcusably poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a minor thing however and what's important is the Xperia Z does the major things right. Videos come up with excellent detail and a solid 30fps framerate. Their bitrate hovers about the 16MBps mark, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the videos is good with a decent, if unspectacular amount of fine detail and decent colors. We'll be able to tell more about that when the review is complete and we've done more shooting with the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z has quad-band 2G and tri-band 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds are an impressive 42 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA. There is also six-band LTE support with 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and connecting to your PC and there's also USB On-the-go support so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia Z but you can get it through the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z also comes with NFC connectivity, although it's easy to overlook considering there are no included NFC tags in the retail package (like with other NFC-enabled Xperia models), and the Xperia SmartTags app used to manage them is also not present. In the settings though you can find and use Google Wallet and Android Beam functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you have an Xperia tablet, Xperia link is a simple app that lets you share the internet connection from your phone to your tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the only web browser on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome as well as Android Jelly Bean does not support Adobe Flash, so getting it working on Xperia Z seems out of the question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z is one head turner of a smartphone that certainly offers a smartphone experience worthy of a flagship. We've never seen a manufacturer do such a great job of squeezing all the potential out of the beastly quad-core Qualcomm chipset and that is easy to see in both benchmark tests and real life scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the Xperia launcher is not too different from what you got with 007's Xperia T, but the super sharp screen and the more powerful internals of the Xperia Z bring the overall experience to a whole new level. And that IP57 certification sweetens up the deal even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only part of the Xperia Z that we tested and didn't absolutely love was the contrast and colors of its display. We are also yet to give the 13 megapixel camera a proper test, but we'll find out more about both of those when the detailed review is complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z aimed for the smartphone of the season title and we can already tell that it's in the running. Soon enough we'll know if it's going to be the favorite or the underdog in the final.</paragraph>
