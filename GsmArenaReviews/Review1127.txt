			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Galaxy Note was a runaway success despite all the doubts that its size and stylus caused. It's understandable then, why the new Samsung Galaxy Note II was greeted with so much excitement. It brings a new and improved screen, boosts processing power significantly and makes the S Pen even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the new phoneblet is quite interesting - Samsung moved it to 16:9 aspect ratio, so it matches the Galaxy S III and extended the diagonal to 5.5". But the Note II Super AMOLED display isn't just the Galaxy S III's screen upsized or even that of the original Note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A peek under a microscope revealed that the Samsung Galaxy Note II uses a completely new Super AMOLED matrix with three subpixels per pixel. It's an unusual matrix for sure, but it might be the sign of things to come for future Galaxy flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II brings the second iteration of the S Pen. The new one is longer and thicker compared to the original, though not as big as the one in the Note 10.1. The new digitizer also offers a great deal of new features - better pressure sensitivity and hover detection of the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there are some cool new software tricks to complement the improved stylus - the hover function triggers various previews (everything from email to video), the bigger button on the S Pen enables a variety of gestures and there's a new homescreen pane that automatically pops up when you use the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of software, the Galaxy Note II will be one of the first Samsung devices to launch with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean out of the box (along with the Galaxy Camera). The combination of the latest Android and the fast Exynos chipset with a quad-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz makes the Note II a performance beast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point it's clear, that we have one of the devices of the season on our hands here, so let's waste no more time and get down to testing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll make a more detailed hardware inspection when we do a proper preview, but for this introduction of the Samsung Galaxy Note II we'll just cover the interesting bits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display and S Pen are arguably the most interesting hardware features, so they get their own chapters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II takes the Galaxy S III design and upscales it. It has roughly the same surface area as the original Note, but is slightly taller and narrower. It's also a bit thinner and the weight is practically unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The narrower device does feel slightly better in the hand, but it's still a large slab - it's a full 10mm wider than the already big Galaxy S III. Yet the Samsung Galaxy Note II is not too hard to pocket - it might not fit every pocket, but it's entirely possible to carry it around like a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as connectivity goes, the Note II will come in two versions - HSPA+ and LTE. Both use the same Exynos chipset, but the LTE version has an additional modem (some Samsung handsets switch to a Qualcomm chipset for their LTE versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II only has a couple of wired ports, but between them they handle all the needed functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack on top does wired headset and headphones duty, while the microUSB port on the bottom handles charging and data connection with a computer. It's also MHL-enabled, so you can output HD video through an HDMI adapter or use USB Host functions with another adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phoneblet looks pretty barren - it houses an 8MP camera and a single-LED flash near the top and the loudspeaker near the bottom. The camera protrudes slightly, so the Note II rests on it when you place it on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung used the same hyperglazed plastic to construct the outer shell of the Galaxy Note II as on the Galaxy S III. It comes in Marble White and Titanium Grey. The back cover is removable and below it you'll find the beefy 3100mAh battery along with the microSIM and microSD card slots. The SIM card is blocked by the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be a flip cover accessory for the Note II. It's the same as the one the original Note and the Galaxy S III got. It replaces the back cover and provides protection for the screen. The flap is made of leather.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display - PenTile begone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A lot of people were hoping that Samsung would move to a non-PenTile screen for the Galaxy Note II and the Koreans delivered. They changed other features of the screen too, like the surface on top, which is now Gorilla Glass 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the diagonal grew to 5.55" (up from 5.3") and the aspect ratio changed - the Galaxy Note II uses a 720p screen (16:9) instead of WXGA (16:10).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this amounts to is a taller, narrower screen (and consequently taller, narrower device) and a slightly increased surface area - the Galaxy Note II screen has about 2% more surface area than the original Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The removal of that 80-pixel wide strip resulted in a slightly lower pixel density - 267ppi vs. 285ppi. The new matrix, however, makes up for that easily and the perceivable sharpness of the screen is actually higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's no longer a PenTile matrix like on the original Note (which had a slight crosshatch patter noticeable, but only if you look really closely). Perhaps these photos snapped with a digital microscope will help clear up the differences in pixel arrangements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note screen ? Samsung Galaxy Note II screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixels of the Note II have one tall Blue sub-pixel on the left and smaller Green and Red pixels stacked one on top of the other. It's an odd arrangement, but it has three subpixels per pixel. The reason for the different Blue pixel is that Blue AMOLEDs typically have a shorter life and making them bigger balances things out. Also, the Blue pixel doesn't shine as brightly, which also improves its life, but doesn't affect color balance (because it's bigger).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To illustrate how the different arrangement improves sharpness we used our microscope to snap a picture of very tiny text - the line width here is 1px, the font is white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note screen ? Samsung Galaxy Note II screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Galaxy Note II screen lights up individual pixels to display the 1px-wide lines. The old Galaxy Note, however, can't use a single pixel as each individual pixels can't make white, as it only has two of the three needed colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To fix that, the screen uses sub-pixel rendering, which "borrows" a subpixel from a neighboring pixel to make white. But now the line has become 1 2/3px wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This new arrangement seems to result in some very slight color aberrations around sharp edges, but it takes a great deal of eye-strain to try and see it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool addition to the display settings is that even with Automatic brightness turned on, the brightness slider remains active. This allows you to fine-tune the brightness, but still have it adjust automatically to the environment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bigger, more comfortable S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II grew in size over the original and so did the new S Pen. The old one is about 10.4cm long and 5mm thick, while the new one measures 11.3cm in length and 7mm in thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While nowhere near as comfortable as the S Pen on the Galaxy Note 10.1, the one that comes with the Note II feels more like a pen and less than a stylus, compared to the one inside the original Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The button on the S Pen now has a ribbed pattern, making it easier to find by touch (the old one is flat and flush against the surface, which made it tough to use).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II can detect when you pull the S Pen out and brings you to a contextual page, which offers shortcuts (with preview thumbnails) of your recent S Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since there's no lanyard linking the S Pen and the Galaxy Note II, the phoneblet uses it's accelerometer to detect you walking away and will alert you if the stylus isn't in its slot. The feature is pretty conservative and won't trigger until you're several steps away - so you can walk and write without it bothering you, but if you really forgot it and walked away it will start beeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung Galaxy Note II screen can detect the S Pen from a distance, similar to how the Galaxy Note 10.1 worked. The hover feature, called Air View, is not part of the stylus though, we tested the S Pen from the original Note and it worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note II also features a more sensitive digitizer compared to the original. It can distinguish between 1024 different levels of pressure (quadruple what the original managed) and you can really feel the difference in the drawing apps - you get fine-grained control between thin and thick lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note II and its S Pen enable plenty of interesting functions throughout the software, so let's have a look at those now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S pen features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen truly is the center of the Samsung Galaxy Note II experience. It has a large array of new features that boost its usability considerably over what you can do with just your finger tips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered the contextual page, which comes up automatically when you pull out the S Pen. It's only visible when the stylus is out and it's icon is a little pencil, while regular homescreens are still indicated by dots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there's another way to launch apps - with gestures. You press the S Pen button and swipe up to access Quick command. Here you can draw a "@" sign to launch email, or "?" to do a quick search. Besides the symbol you can add a keyword - what to search for with the "?" or recipient, message body or both for the "@" (the Note II will ask which one you want).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also hover the S Pen over various things to get a better look at them - expand S Planner events, preview emails and text, preview videos and even a position in the video timeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen also lets you quickly snap a portion of the screen and use it in an app - email, S Note, etc. Speaking of S Note, you can launch it by double tapping with the S Pen while holding down its button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video from Samsung that does a great job of showcasing all the S Pen features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II comes with a number of cool apps preinstalled. A lot of them are centered around the S Pen, but there are some other nice additions as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that is not strictly an app, but a cool feature nonetheless, is Smart rotation. It builds on the Smart stay feature introduced with the Galaxy S III - it keeps track of your eyes and will rotate the screen accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is great for situations where you're lying down and the accelerometer will try to rotate the screen the wrong way. Smart rotation keeps the screen oriented properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app got more updates, not just the Air View features. It now uses a split screen interface - when you go into a folder, the content of the folder is displayed on the right, while adjacent folders are displayed on the left. It's similar to how the file browser in Windows works, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app has a similar split-screen interface, though that one is available only in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an app called Point&amp;, which uses the Galaxy Note II's camera to scan text. You can translate that text, you can use it to read printed web links or look up the definitions of single printed words (there are English, German, French and Italian dictionaries preloaded).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You already saw Paper Artist in the video in the previous chapter. It imports a photo and runs a filter over it (there are plenty to choose from). Then you can go in with the S Pen and color certain areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note should already be familiar to you from the original Note and Note 10.1. It offers several templates and you can enter handwritten notes, regular text with the on-screen keyboard (or handwriting recognition), complex mathematical formulas along with images and voice notes. There's also a floating window version of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is equally easy to use with fingers and with the S Pen. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, moth, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a really cool feature is the screen recording. It's activated by pressing and holding the Home and Volume up buttons and it records what's happening on the screen (including what you draw with the S Pen) and captures your audio commentary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you didn't, go back and watch the video in the previous chapter to see these apps in action.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, S Pen or something else?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II comes with several text input options. Yes, there is handwriting recognition using the S Pen, but even the standard on-screen QWERTY has several different options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big screen makes for a comfortable portrait typing, and we really appreciate the extra row just for the numbers. Two finger typing is comfortable on the Note II in portrait mode, but becomes a pain in landscape. The landscape QWERTY also obscures too much of the screen, so we ended up sticking to portrait orientation for text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right on the keyboard to position the cursor. Okay, this isn't new but this is - you can hover over a text field with the S Pen and a cursor appears. You have to tap to position it there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype). This is available on the Galaxy S III too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we move on to handwriting recognition. It's very accurate (even with our awful penmanship) and the thicker, longer S Pen helps quite a bit to improve the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II has very advanced text prediction features to eradicate typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to the non-keyboard text input methods. You can, of course, use voice input and since the Galaxy Note II is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phablet is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the camera - yes, the camera. You can snap a photo of text and the Galaxy Note II will run OCR on it and enter it automatically. The great thing about this is that you don't need an Internet connection for this either. You can fit an entire A4 page and the Note II will transcribe it in a matter of seconds. You'll need to proof-read the text though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Galaxy Note II is smart about picking which text input method to show you. If you tap a field with you finger, it will bring up the QWERTY keyboard. If you tap a field with the S Pen instead, it will launch the handwriting recognition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note II is powered by a homebrewed chipset - Exynos 4412 Quad. It has a quartet of Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.6GHz along with 2GB of RAM and Mali-400 GPU. We'll hold off on the analysis of the benchmarks, we think the results speak for themselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera with 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't spend too much time on the Samsung Galaxy Note II camera for now, but we'll revisit it in more detail in the next preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses the same interface as the Galaxy S III and snaps up to 8MP stills and records 1080p@30fps videos. It has advanced features like burst shot, HDR, Share shot and Buddy photo share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples along with a sample video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the video sample, don't forget to choose 1080p and view it in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note II also has a feature called Best faces - it snaps a burst of 5 photos, keeping track of people's faces. Later, you can pick any of the 5 photos for each person's face individually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our short time with the Samsung Galaxy Note II is over, but it was enough to whet our appetite and we'll surely be coming back for more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Galaxy Note was virtually unchallenged in the phablet field, but it still faced the hard task of generating proper interest in the niche. The over 10 million units sold are the proof that it did a really good job. So in a way the Galaxy Note II is a lucky device - it comes in a market that is already starting to develop, but still devoid of any major competition. Now add the host of improvements it brings over its predecessor and things are looking really great for the Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, the Note II buyers will fall into two categories. First are the business people and artist who need the easy note taking, idea sketching or graphics tablet functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second category would be tech geeks who just want the big screen, powerful hardware and latest Android Jelly Bean goodness, with the S Pen being an extra rather than the central feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing is for sure though, the Note devices - both phablets and the tablet and tablet - have brought back the stylus from the brink of extinction. And while Android tablets are still having a bit of a struggle in the market, the Note hybrids are quickly conquering new ground for the Google OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter how you look at it, all indications point to the Galaxy Note II repeating - and most likely beating - the success of its predecessor. Here's hoping the good impressions stand after we spend a bit more time with the Note II.</paragraph>
