			<paragraph>What else can my mobile phone do for me? It almost makes you wonder if there still are people out there using their phones for calling and texting only. We've seen oblique, farfetched and elite options gradually become make-or-break for mobile phone buyers. Handsets with GPS support are enjoying a growing interest lately. More and more people are considering switching to a device with built-in GPS or buying an external receiver to use with their current phone. We are getting tons of requests for a detailed look at the issue, so we decided it's about time we did something about it. In this article we try to shed light on the capabilities a Bluetooth GPS receiver gives you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The chosen two<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this is not the focus of our review but it's important to make a few points about different GPS receivers. We tested two devices produced by one of the world's most popular manufacturers HOLUX. Holux M1000 and Holux GPSlim 240 are the lucky participants in our test. We decided to go for them mainly because a comparison like this makes a clear point about the differences between the most popular GPS chipsets: the SiRF Star III and the quickly catching up MTK MT3318. The latter is pitched for its one of kind power saving properties providing unbeaten battery lifetime. As it turned out, it lives up to its reputation but we'll come back to that a little later in our article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One thing you can't help noticing when comparing the two Bluetooth GPS receivers. The M1000 is more than twice the size of GPSlim 240 and of course it weighs a good 50% more than its competitor. Don't get us wrong, it is still compact enough at 65 x 43 x 17.6 mm and 53 grams of weight. Still, the GPSlim is well worth its name. After all, 64 x 22 x 15 mm is about the size of a car key and 35 grams is an insignificant weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two devices are very similar designwise - they have oblong shape with three LED indicators at the top and a miniUSB port on the side. The LEDs are easy to use status indicators. There is a dedicated LED for the battery status, Bluetooth connection and, of course, GPS data. The latter blinks when the receiver has locked to enough satellites to provide a (more or less) exact location. If the signal is not strong enough though, the LED will produce continuous orange light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the larger M1000 is that its battery can be replaced, which means that you can have as many batteries as you like to go endless hours without needing to charge. As our experience with the M1000 showed however, you are very unlikely to ever need that. The advertised 23 hours of battery life is not too far from what you get in real-life usage. The by far smaller GPSlim 240 receiver, on the other hand, is supposed to only last 8 hours and so it does. OK, "only" does sound highly ironic. 8 hours is in fact a lot of time, more than enough for almost any situation. We have to mention here that both receivers come with a car charger adapter, in addition to the USB charger cables they have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Enough small talk about design, we now focus on what really matters - the performance of the two GPS receivers. The differences we came across are conditioned by the completely different chipsets used. The initial start time (the time elapsing from powering the receiver and achieving satellite lock) of the M1000 is quoted to be shorter than that of GPSlim 240, but we'll have to disagree. In fact, the GPSlim 240 found enough satellites for a GPS downlink in much shorter time on almost every occasion leaving the M1000 biting the dust. On the other hand, M1000 managed to lock on more satellites than the GPSlim 240, and was able to provide coordinates (although not as exact as usual) in more complicated conditions than its rival. It had no problem when positioned under solid roof at about 4 meters from the nearest window, whereas GPSlim 240 lost contact at about half that distance. This however is not that important, as it is not very likely to use your GPS receiver indoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of data refreshing, the tinier GPSlim 240 communicates with the connected phone far more often refreshing the coordinates on the screen. The power-saving architecture on M1000 only does that once in a second. In real life usage you are highly unlikely to feel any significant difference. Besides, the accuracy of both devices is very good and that's what really matters. An interesting bug we noticed in the GPSlim 240: it loses signal upon a rapid change of speed - mostly when breaking suddenly at high speed. This of course happens for less than a second, so you are unlikely to even notice that when using it for in-car navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if we have to choose we will probably go for the Holux M1000 Bluetooth GPS receiver, despite the fact that it is quite larger, mostly for its stunning battery life and slightly lower price, though we have to admit the GPSlim 240 is just as good for the job.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Route66<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, having given you a bit of choice in terms of hardware, let's look at the software. We are going to bring into the light a few navigation applications, so you can make up your mind about which one of them will best suit your needs. A thing for you to consider is the map coverage, as different applications have different areas covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The journey begins with the Route66 applications. They are available for the three most popular mobile phone platforms - Symbian S60, Windows Mobile Professional and Windows Mobile Standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile 7 is the version for Windows Mobile Standard and the manufacturer claims it's the most complete GPS navigation solution. Well, we wouldn't go that far but we still give credit to Route66 for including free real-time traffic information, which makes for congestion free route planning. Another key feature of Mobile 7 is the fast re-routing in case you stray from the original route. Our experience showed that address searching is really fast even on large maps, so you won't need to wait for hours before the program finds the address you entered. The newly included GPS signal extrapolation allows navigation to continue even in tunnels. So unless you are crossing the English Channel, you won't see you Windows Mobile smartphone lose its signal. The Mobile 7 application also has something for those who often get speeding tickets - it will give away a warning signal once a predefined speed limit is exceeded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Mobile 7 is really cool but, frankly, the other navigation solutions included in this article do have their strong points too. It all boils down to taste, so it's entirely up to you to decide which one does it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As indicated on the Route66 web site, the cost of Mobile 7 with an all-European map included is 249.95 Euro, while the version with UK and Ireland maps only is a few cents short of 200 Euro. Among the niceties of the retail package are a Bluetooth GPS receiver (with Sirf Star III chipset), memory card with an adapter and a memory card reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For Windows Mobile Professional users, Route66 offers the Navigate 7 application. In terms of functionality it's identical to Mobile 7, only suited to work with touch sensitive displays. It provides ample, easy to hit buttons, so you can easily use it in any conditions. Otherwise, it offers basically the same user-friendly interface and customization options as Mobile 7. 2D and 3D views of the maps are available, and so are night colors for better usability in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recently acquired by Nokia, NAVTEQ is the map provider for the Navigate 7 application's database. As a matter of fact, NAVTEQ also supports the Mobile 7 maps and their most recent edition is from the first quarter of 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navigate 7 application with Great Britain and Ireland maps will cost you 59.95 Euro, while the version including all the available European maps is worth EUR 119.95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Route 66 has an offering for the Symbian OS with the S60 UI. The software is a namesake of the Windows smartphone solution - Mobile 7. The version for Symbian phones however supports maps dated from the 3rd quarter of 2005.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You guessed it right, the interface differs a little from the previously mentioned versions, the key modification being the 12-button keypad optimization, as this keypad layout is used in most of S60 smartphones. The included points of interest are more than 1.15 million all around Europe including hotels, restaurants, museums and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the Symbian variety of Mobile 7 varies from 199.95 to 249.95 Euro depending on the included maps. In all of the packages however, there is a Bluetooth GPS receiver included. No further chargers or subscriptions apply, as is the case for all other Route66 navigation applications. Bear in mind that although the traffic information is free, you may be charged for the data transfers based on your current mobile telephony plan.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TomTom Navigator 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another big name in the navigation software has a solution for smartphones and PDA. The TomTom Navigator 6 is the latest version of the software currently available for purchase on the company's web site. It is another easy-to-use program to offer voice and visual turn-by-turn navigation. It relies on Teleatlas maps and has detailed coverage of over 20 European countries. The cost of the package is from 99 to 249 Euro depending on the contents (number of maps included and optional Bluetooth GPS receiver). For this price you receive all the essentials to get you going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, if you are in for some extras, TomTom surely has something to offer. If you are willing to pay a little on top, that is. Traffic information makes sure you don't get stuck in traffic jams for ages, while speed trap alerts reduce the chances of receiving a speeding ticket. A whole load of additional points of interest can also be purchased as well, if you want to make sure you're on top of all the interesting places in the vicinity. Be it restaurants, train stations or football grounds, you will be able to visit them all. Just a few clicks and the Navigator will guide you there in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navigator 6 also offers additional voices in case you get bored with the default ones. Whether you prefer a cheerful young voice or a mature and accomplished performer you can purchase and install it effortlessly following the instructions on the manufacturer's website. Even John Cleese's voice is available if you happen to like him.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other available extras, or PLUS Services as the guys at TomTom call them, include weather forecasts and an audiobook reader. Additional color schemes are also available, as well as QuickGPSFix, which basically adds assisted GPS. This will help your device achieve quicker initial satellite lock. A particularly interesting feature we found is the Routes, which is actually a database of roads with great views. It is not the most useful of features but a bunch of breathtaking views would surely be appreciated by those willing to add some excitement to their trips. Anyway, all these are just extra features, nothing you cannot live without. So, buying them or not won't really have an impact on performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Garmin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next in line is Garmin. Another leading GPS navigation hardware and software manufacturer, it is no wonder the company offers one of the most complete and advanced GPS navigation solutions for mobile devices. Garmin Mobile XT is fully functional navigation software, which comes complete with City Navigator NT maps. It is compatible with all smartphones and PPC, and even laptops. There is even a dedicated version for the business-minded RIM Blackberry users. It is also worth noting that the City Navigator NT maps database is one of the richest in content, offering detailed maps for quite a large number of countries and a plethora of points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the turn-by-turn voice guidance, Garmin Mobile XT also offers Traffic information, weather forecasts and a whole bunch of other cool features. There is information about gas prices, hotel rates and availability, and so on. These are all accessed through your phone, so you'll have to pay for data transfers. Having an unlimited data subscription plan will sure come handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool extra of Garmin Mobile XT is the PeerPoints feature. It allows text messaging your position to other phones, as well as navigating to the location of any other users in your group. Advertised as a perfect feature to keep track of friends and family in a theme park, we are more than convinced that it can do much more than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cost of the package is between $99.99 and $199.99 for a one-year subscription. The $200 package also includes a Bluetooth GPS receiver. The subscription duration is only applicable to the network based services, such as traffic info.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sygic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another offering we look at is the Sygic Drive application. Although produced by a relatively unknown company, this application is fully capable of standing up to the big guns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Combining the Teleatlas maps with a nice user interface and a large number of route planning options, the Sygic drive sure is a great offer for those looking for mobile navigation software. Its performance is quite pleasing, with smooth map handling and quick route calculation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sygic Drive application has optimized versions for Symbian smartphones and Windows mobile devices, and features left and right-handed modes along with a few quick guides. There is also a GPS log, which is quite a rare feature in this application range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile GMaps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last but one piece of software in our GPS navigation roundup is the Mobile Gmaps. This is a free Java application that runs on any mobile supporting CLDC 1.0 and MIDP 1.0 or later. This basically means that you will have a hard time finding incompatible devices on the market nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about Mobile Gmaps (next to costing zip, of course) is that it has multiple map sources - Yahoo! Maps, Windows Live Local and Open Street Map, just to name a few. You can opt for any of these sources depending on the current scenario. The phone can either download the maps on the go or have them saved on the memory card in advance, to use later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the obvious flaws of this software solution are the not so user-friendly interface and the lack of actual navigation. All it can do when paired with a GPS receiver is show your exact location, as well as your near surroundings. Yet, if you are looking for something that can work on almost any phone for no money, this might just be your stuff. Of course, bear in mind that data traffic charges may apply, as the software downloads the maps live and online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another free application compatible with tons of different devices is Google Maps. Until its launch, the map database of Google Maps was available in the Mobile Gmaps application, but not any more. It seems that's Google's way of saying what's mine is mine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application itself has quite extensive functionality, including real-time traffic information, detailed directions and very nice place search. The interface is not the best we've seen in terms of user-friendliness but the presence of satellite images makes up for that to some extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the recently announced 2.0 version offers the promising "My location" feature. It allows the phone to pinpoint your location even if a GPS receiver is not paired with the phone. The promised accuracy of around 1000 m raises doubts - to say the least - but there are cases when it can go down to 200 m. Not bad, having in mind that all that the program uses is cell tower triangulation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The streets on the map also serve as an indicator of the traffic speed. Supposedly, you can drive at over 50mph on green streets, yellow allows speeds from 26 to 50 mps, while red crawls at under 25 mph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are available versions of Google Maps application for Java, Blackberry and Symbian S60 platforms, while native Windows Mobile compatibility was recently added.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This was our attempt at showing you how the two major competing GPS receiver chipsets perform in real life situations. We also wanted to shed some light on some of the available products by the major navigation software providers. The prices quoted in this article are strictly indicative only, in case you are interested in any of them you should check your local prices and most importantly - maps availability. We can?t pick a clear winner among the available software, since a choice like this is a matter of personal taste and budget. The free alternatives are also excellent and it won?t hurt trying them out before you step in with a paid solution.</paragraph>
