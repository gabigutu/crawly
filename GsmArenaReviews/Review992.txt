			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With flagships coming in like clockwork, Samsung obviously thought it was time for their entry-level Android lineup to also get a fresh of coat of paint. And that goes all the way to the bottom, where the Galaxy Y prepares to make room for the new kid on the block. This time around, with the new naming Samsung is not leaving anyone guessing about who this phone is for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young S6310 is the most basic of packages in Samsung's updated Android lineup. It's the most affordable too, so that says it all about the level of equipment. Let's just say, you could probably fit the hardware specs of this one on a matchbox. The important thing though is that the Young does well to upgrade its predecessor in terms of screen resolution and processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite surprisingly, the Young even has more RAM than the supposedly higher-ranked Galaxy Fame, which we only recently reviewed. Not that it makes that much difference but, based on our experience with the Fame, the Young should be quite nippy and responsive. The only place where the Galaxy Young clearly feels inferior is still imaging - it's got a really low-end 3MP fixed focus camera. It has no front-mounted camera either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, everything that's built to a budget involves compromise and the Galaxy Young is no different. What it will be trying to do is convince enough users that its flaws are outweighed by its charms - like offering Android Jelly Bean on rock bottom pricing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean in the driver's seat and a solid connectivity set, complete with things like hotspot and Wi-Fi direct, the Galaxy Young is trying to stay relevant, albeit on a shoestring. The FM radio and the microSD card slot will certainly be appreciated too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inevitably, there were some corners cut, but we're yet to see if that's had a significant impact on the overall experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Young 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young has a familiar glossy finish, but the white paintjob helps it avoid looking cheap. At 109.4 x 58.6 x 12.5 mm, it's well on the thick side even for an entry-level droid. On the other hand, the Young weighs the reasonable 112g and is very comfortable to hold and easy to operate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, the Young is clearly indebted to the Galaxy S III, though you can't reasonably expect the same level of sophistication. The glossy finish, obviously being no hyperglaze, is quite simple but the white paintjob is good at hiding fingerprints. The handset is comfortably curved and fits nicely in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom and 3.5mm audio jack on the top are readily accessible, while the microSD card slot is located underneath the battery cover. It's above the battery compartment itself, so you can hot-swap it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the usual set of controls: capacitive Menu and Back keys on either side of a hardware Home key. The keys are well sized and spaced but the capacitive controls have no haptics or backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you'll find the earpiece, as well as a proximity sensor. There's no ambient light sensor though, so auto screen brightness adjustment is not availble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom are the microUSB port and the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Young we find the volume rocker while the power/lock key is symmetrically placed across on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young has a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera and no LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is in the top right corner at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover closes around of the sides of the device as well. It's fairly easy to remove by gently pulling at the top, but it fits tightly in place with no squeaks or wobble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover we find the microSD card slot, the SIM compartment and the 1300 mAh battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young features a 3.27" capacitive touchscreen, which is a small but important step up from the previous generation of entry-level droids. HVGA (320 x 480) resolution is the new QVGA, it seems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD is otherwise as basic as it gets, with less than impressive contrast and viewing angles. There isn't auto brightness adjustment either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean out of the box, skinned with the latest TouchWiz launcher, dubbed Nature UX. The user interface is basically identical to that of the Galaxy S III mini and the S II Plus: they have the same Android version and screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the obvious benefits to the user experience compared to stock Android, a clearly lowrange handset takes advantage of basically the premium combination that powers all of the company's midrange models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a brief video showing off the user interface here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" affair and there're ripples accompanied by water-drop sound as you drag your finger. There are a number of unlock routines to choose from: motion, face and voice among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're three customizable lockscreen shortcuts (down from five on the big S III and Note II), and you can drag one to activate the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits three custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one always opens the app drawer, but the other four can be set to any shortcut or even a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is quite feature-rich and offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Bluetooth. You can swipe to the side to get even more: Mobile data, Blocking mode, Power saving and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the brightness slider (there's no automatic brightness toggle here though). There is also a couple of other useful things like the Settings shortcut in the upper right corner, the time/date to its left and the carrier name at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean, notifications can be expanded to show more info. They can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer accommodates both app shortcuts and widgets. Unlike stock Android, you cannot move between tabs by swipes - you have to explicitly hit the widget tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets is not as intuitive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes: a Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean comes with a selection of widgets, with some custom additions by Samsung. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is available natively in Jelly Bean. Widgets automatically move out of the way when you're reorganizing the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Ice Cream Sandwich-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. A sideways swipe removes the app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three buttons at the bottom of the list - one to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager, one to launch Google Now and a 'Kill all apps' button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX on top of Android 4.1 looks great and the Galaxy Young does pack most of the cool software tricks of the midrange Samsung entries. And despite the lack of a blazing fast chipset, the Galaxy Young handles the heavy Samsung skin equally well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young is powered by a Qualcomm MSM7227A chipset, which packs a 1GHz ARM Cortex-A5 processor, 768MB of RAM and Adreno 200 GPU. Those are hardly the guts of a benchmark champion, but they are quite common among entry level smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've compared the Galaxy Young with other entry- and mid-level devices to give you a clearer picture as to which ones have the edge when it comes to performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant gives the smartphone an all-round grade for processing (calculative and graphic, memory speed, SD card writing, etc). The Galaxy Young scored just below the Xperia E here, but managed to beat Sony's last-year entry.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has room for everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. There are four tabs on top accommodating the Phone app, Groups, Favorites and Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text (left swipe). The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap of the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all available details, across two tabs. The first one is the About tab, with the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. If the phonebook finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there is a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has even added a built-in reject list. You choose a specific vibration pattern too as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like in the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes any unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from those sources as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Samsung Galaxy Young is reasonable. Reception is problem-free though and we didn't suffer dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers a quick shortcut for sending a message. Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Young. It managed a Good mark, so it should be loud enough for most situations. The vibration could have been stronger though. More about our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box grows as much as it needs to - it can fill the entire screen (above the on-screen keyboard that is), expanding up to 10 lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule a message to be sent automatically at a later point in time. There's a list of all scheduled messages in case you need to cancel or send a message ahead of time manually. You can also mark certain numbers as "spam", in case some automatic promo texts get pushy, and lock messages to prevent their deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox. Another cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a sync schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young comes with several text input options. You have the traditional QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode (which is a little cramped) and landscape mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Portrait and landscape QWERTY keyboards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right to switch between letters and symbols or you can enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like swiping your finger around but Continuous input isn't your thing, you can try using the handwriting recognition. It's quite accurate too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and, since the Young is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phone is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock gallery with a pinch of TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young comes with the default Jelly Bean Gallery which, as you'd imagine, has been treated to some TouchWiz flavor. It opens up in Album view, which is what we're used to seeing. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the bottom of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, as well as customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Young will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize people automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with SoundAlive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young employs the same TouchWiz-ed music player as the Galaxy S4. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. The company also uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music is sorted into various categories and one of the options, called Music square, is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and places those tracks on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to skip songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young player sadly isn't DLNA-enabled, so you're limited to tracks on your handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Okay video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers several view modes - grid, list and folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three view modes for how the video fits the screen (fit to screen, fill screen, 100% resolution). The SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung droids usually have excellent video players, but this one wasn't quite up to par. It can't play 1080p videos, but more importantly, it lacks support for MKV files. It sticks to MP4 and AVI (and some XviD files didn't play smoothly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you tweak the viewing experience out of the screen by adjusting video brightness, Auto play next, play speed, SoundAlive and enable subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young did win some points for its subtitles support. It scans for all available subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young did excellently in our audio quality test. The smartphone had pretty low volume levels, but its output was impressively clean, particularly when you consider its price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Fame managed excellent scores all over the field, with the only average frequency response the only exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones, stereo crosstalk increased and some intermodulation distortion crept in, but it was nothing too bad. An impressively solid overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young sports a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera and there is no LED flash. That should be enough to tell you that the smartphone's camera will only do for an occasional photo when you have nothing else available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on previous Samsung handsets touting TouchWiz. On the right there's the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any three shortcuts to put there - its let you easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth shortcut always points to Settings. You can also move the icons around to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as features go, you get goodies like geotagging, smile detection, panorama mode, Share shot, scenes and effects. There's no touch focus, burst mode or HDR, but we can't expect the Young to match the big boys in terms of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3MP doesn't sound exciting at all, but the Galaxy Young has a decent shooters from the 3MP shooters pool we've seen. The level of detail is decent, but that's as much as it gets, really. Colors are too subdued for our liking, but you can adjust that from the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've put the Galaxy Young against some other 3MP snappers so you can check the image quality for yourselves in our dedicated Photo Compare Tool. You can choose other adversaries as you please, and all you need to look for is explained in the tools' main page.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording is disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young captures VGA video at around 24fps, which is rather poor, but sadly, that's about all you can expect out of a phone with a basic single-core processor and a 3MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has the same interface as the still camera and some of the same settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bitrate of 2.0Mbps and stereo AAC sound (128Kbps, 48kHz). The resolved detail isn't great, but it seems as if the noise reduction is less aggressive to the video than it is to still images. Plus, the videos look smoother than expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young has the standard set of connectivity features - quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers b/g/n with Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA is also part of the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE, which builds on Bluetooth 3.0 with the efficient Low Energy mode. It has better range and uses less energy than previous iterations and is becoming quite popular with training accessories (like heart rate monitors and cadence sensors), elbowing out ANT+ technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Young has a built-in A-GPS receiver that also works with GLONASS. With both global positioning systems, you get more satellites available, which improves lock times and accuracy both in the urban jungle and in an actual jungle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tweaked Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young has a tweaked version of the Jelly Bean Android browser, but Chrome also comes pre-installed, if that's what you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the default browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young comes with QuickOffice out of the box and it's the full version that can create and edit files too. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint files (97, 2007 and 2010 docs are supported) and can view PDFs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editors are quite capable - the Word editor can do complex text formatting, create tables, while the Excel editor has full support for editing formulas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is easy to use with your fingers. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner app can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled its new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Young. It can sync contacts, calendar and S memos and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app features is laid out across five tabs, each with a different function. The first tab lets you create multiple alarms (each with a distinct repeat time and ring tone), then there are the World clock, stopwatch, timer and desk clock tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the phone horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app lets you browse all the files in your phones' memory or on an attached microSD card. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone, an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline caching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy Young has access to the latest apps and the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Keep in mind though that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung Apps works in much the same way; there's a featured interface which shows the more popular app highlights, as well as pages which display the newest and most downloaded applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the option to browse through app categories, and installing an app is done exactly the same way as in the Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young doesn't do anything profoundly different compared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Y. An HVGA screen and a 1GHz processor are actually the least you would expect, considering the two models are almost two years apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young has a dual-SIM version too, which seems to be the trend these days in the Android low-end. At &#x20ac;20 more than the standard package, the Galaxy Young Duos is a tempting offer. The single-SIM version is priced at under &#x20ac;140 in Europe and other markets shouldn't be too far off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, at that price you can't expect the Young to break any speed records. The 1GHz single-core CPU and 768MB of RAM are actually more than enough to ensure a smooth ride around Jelly Bean and TouchWiz. In fact, the recent software is one of the phone's major advantages be we doubt it Samsung will put much effort into updating the Young beyond this line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means you are getting exactly what you paid for. No more, no less. Still, it would be nice to see what the competition has to offer for this kind of money, before cashing out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia E dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E is Sony's direct response to the Galaxy Young, packing the same CPU, a 3MP camera and a slightly larger 3.5" screen of the same HVGA resolution. Sony's entry has a little less RAM, but also runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. It also has its own dual SIM twin, too. Ultimately, it will be brand loyalty, personal taste and the availability of carrier deals to decide this one.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The second generation of the LG's L series offers a couple of alternatives, too. Actually, in terms of specs and price tag, the Galaxy Young is sandwiched between the L3 II and the L5 II. The L3 II is, of course, a lot closer, the lower QVGA screen resolution being the only notable difference.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Having checked out some affordable Androids, the cheapest WP8-powered competition seems to be making a seriously strong case. The Nokia Lumia 520 easily beats the above selection by offering a dual-core CPU (of the Krait variety, no less) and 720p video recording, in addition to more than twice the pixels on the screen. The Lumia 520 costs about the same as the Galaxy Young too, so unless the relatively limited app selection in the Windows Phone Store is a deal-breaker, it's definitely a must-consider.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Galaxy Young doesn't really push the bottom of the Android smartphone pricing. Instead, it only replaces an older model in the same price segment. In the same time, last year's midrange smartphone prices have taken a good plunge and today, you can have them for just a little more than the asking price of a commitment-free Galaxy Young.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 (140&#x20ac;) and the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160 (&#x20ac;160) both have bigger screens, better cameras and both have been promised a Jelly Bean ticket straight out of Gingerbread land. For us, screen size is paramount to having a good and rewarding Android experience, so the small price difference is well worth it.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Galaxy Young is an easy package to live with if you approach it with the right attitude. Of course you can't expect to be getting a Galaxy S4 for the fraction of the price. We're talking a totally different set of users and, most likely, completely different markets as well. The Galaxy Young couldn't have been clearer about its target demographic. And it looks like the right thing for first-time smartphone users.</paragraph>
