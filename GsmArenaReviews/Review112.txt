			<paragraph>The slim and stylish no-nonsense handset has been a Nokia trademark ever since the 6300 took the world by storm a few years back. However, it's only now after a run of equally popular successors that we realize just how much the Slim Finn changed the rules of the game. And the Nokia 6700 classic is here to say that no matter how simple and seemingly perfect things are, they can always get better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everyone wants a high-end camera, a huge touchscreen or a QWERTY keyboard and - even if they do - not everyone is keen to dish out. The extra features are always welcome to have on board but in the end it's about the core functions of a phone that you want to work and want to work well. They say money can't buy you love but when a handset is great at the basics and looks like a million bucks it has every right to disagree. And the Nokia 6700 classic, like its forerunners, seems to know just how to please a massive crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brief look at the features listed above is enough to convince you that the Nokia 6700 classic is more than a pretty face. However we doubt it that anyone with I-want-features-and-I-want-them-all mentality will put it on top of their shopping list. On the other hand, the extra stuff will be better used to persuade Nokia 6500 classic owners that there is enough there for an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, one of the best-equipped S40 handsets might also be able to convert new fans who want decent functionality but are intimidated by smartphones. Until recently Sony Ericsson, LG and Samsung were enjoying a free run there, but with the Nokia 6600i slide and the Nokia 6700 classic, the market leader is quite keen to regain some of that ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, one thing we know is we shouldn't keep a stunning looker like the Nokia 6700 classic in that cardboard box any longer. Hit the jump to get to the real deal and prepare to be jealous.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic comes with a retail package that suits its price tag well. Along with the handset itself, inside you will find a 1GB SD card and that tiny microUSB cable that measures about 5cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you also get a charger and a microUSB handsfree, which unfortunately is one-piece. This means that if you are to replace it, you will have to find either a microUSB-to-some-other-standard adapter or a pair of headphones with that connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you get a bunch of paperwork and a voucher for free music worth 10 euro that you can cash in at the online Nokia music store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see there's hardly anything missing in the box, but then again, there are no nice surprises either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6700 classic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly one of the best parts about Nokia 6700 classic is its compact size. The dimensions of 109.8 x 45 x 11.2 mm add up to volume of mere 46.5 cc, which is even more compact than its 6500 classic predecessor (47 cc). Even hardened geeks like us that are used to seeing their phones big and functional couldn't help but fall in love with the tiny fella.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What really sold it for us was that despite being small, the Nokia 6700 class is quite heavy (113 grams), which gives it a really solid feel. Rarely has a handset felt as good in our hands as the 6700 classic does.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Nokia 6700 classic brings to mind an old saying: perfection is not when there's no more to add, but when there's nothing more to take away. In fact, there is hardly anything that we'd remove from the 6700 classic's shiny panels. Well, okay we'd get rid of the LED flash aperture at the back as it is useless, but everything else we like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also especially appreciate the fact that the entire body of the Nokia 6700 classic is made of fine stainless steel that is really smudge-resistant. Also if you do happen to get the handset greasy, cleaning it is a piece of cake as any cloth (or your shirt) will do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start our tour with the 2.2" display mounted on the upper half of Nokia 6700 classic front panel. The TFT LCD unit supports QVGA resolution and can display up to 16 million colors, as is customary on the S40 handsets recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbers alone indicate that this isn't what you might call a top-notch display. Still the image quality is pretty decent with good brightness and fine contrast (although nothing like the Samsung S7220 Ultra b AMOLED display). On the other hand the sunlight legibility of the Nokia 6700 classic is flawless with the screen remaining perfectly legible in any weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main problem with the Nokia 6700 display is its size. It might be just us getting older and pickier, but 2.2" just doesn't cut it anymore. We're perfectly aware of the fact that a larger screen would mean a larger body and thus a loss of a part of the handset's appeal; still we cannot help but wish for at least a 2.4" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find four keys - two either side of the traditional D-pad found on the Finnish featurephones. Those include the two soft buttons with functionality changing according to the active menu as well as the Call and End keys. Decently sized and with nice tactile feedback, we never really have anything to complain about them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad itself has pretty thin direction keys, yet it's still possible to use even with our oversized hands. The fact that there is some much free space around it also helps so is the size is no obstacle to usability really. And the large confirmation center button works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below those controls sits the 12-key alphanumeric keypad. The thin lines provide some bordering between the different rows and the keys are pretty big so you can type fairly comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solid, even feedback is also greatly appreciated and if there was some kind of border between keys on the same row it would have been perfect. Well, considering that looks were high on the priority list when the Nokia 6700 classic was designed we should be perfectly happy with this one too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only two remaining functional elements on the front panel are the ambient light sensor and the loudspeaker grill at the top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Nokia 6700 classic have a lot fewer controls than usual, but compared to the Nokia 6500 classic, they have, in fact, increased in number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one you get a camera shutter key and a volume rocker on the right side, while neither of those was available on the handset's predecessor. However the keys are pretty thin and getting used to them is not an easy task. Still, at least the camera key gives off a satisfying click when half pressed, and another one when pushed all the way down. The volume rocker on the other hand has very little going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Nokia 6700 classic bears the microUSB jack as well as the Nokia proprietary charger plug and the microphone pinhole. You can also use the microUSB slot for charging if you prefer. Unfortunately, there's no protection on top of the jacks to prevent them from accumulating dust and dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side and the top of Nokia 6700 are completely deprived of any functional elements whatsoever. As plain as they get those are certainly the better looking profiles of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera, accompanied by one of the tiniest LED flash units we have ever seen. The loudspeaker grill is also here, on the other side of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nicely performing camera lens (more on that later in the review) has virtually no protection against scratches. That means you need to be extremely careful when handling it if you want the image quality to stay the same as it was on the day you bought the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the steel battery cover reveals the microSD card slot, the SIM card slot and, of course the 960 mAh BL-6Q Li-Ion battery. Event though the card slot is down here, it is completely hot-swappable so you can easily access the card without having to restart the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery capacity is one of improvements over the Nokia 6500 classic. The 6700 comes with an almost 20 percent larger battery, which can easily give you four days of light-to-moderate usage (20 minutes of telephony a day plus about 40 minutes of using other phone features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Nokia 6700 classic is just great. All the materials used look so durable that the handset looks ready to be your companion for quite a while. If we need to hair-split we should point out that there is a tiny cleft between the glass covering the display and the frame around it, but it's nothing to really worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the hardware review let us just say that the Nokia 6700 classic is one of the nicest phones in the hand that we have seen recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The little fella did manage to get under our skin but let's see what goes on under the hood. You can find more about the user interface after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic employs the Series 40 6th edition user interface. The environment is well familiar, and the only novelties are a couple of menu icons and a few tweaks here and there. Most additions are under the hood, but we'll cover them after we've gone through the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the Nokia 6700 classic features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time occupying the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned to a function of your choice. The D-pad directions can be set up as shortcuts - by default, left brings up the new message menu and right the Calendar. The font on the main display can be any color you choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available. It consists of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The second section displays today's events from the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap for time, which started out as a fancy feature of high-end phones has made its way to the Nokia 6700 classic. You can choose between an analogue or digital clock and double tapping the phone will show the clock for a couple of seconds. You can enable vibration feedback as well but that only matters if you're holding the phone in your hand. Tap for time is about the only thing that the accelerometer is used for, thing like the browser don't autorotate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons themselves have been changed and the 3D animation has been dropped. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quick and responsive. There were no freezes or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven predefined ringing profiles on the Nokia 6700 classic, which should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. They can be set to expire at a given time, returning the phone to the previous profile. Flight mode is on hand too, turning off all transceivers and rendering the phone usable without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the S40 user interface seems to be the lack of multi-tasking support - something that Sony Ericsson implemented on their feature phones long ago. With S40 you can't just minimize a Java application (such as the Opera browser) and read a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 is already quite a mature platform - now in its 6th edition - but it seems Nokia have no intention of changing it. Perhaps they want multitasking to be exclusive to their smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What's new in S40 6th edition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is the second S40 6th edition phone we've reviewed (the first being the 6303 classic). We went into more detail in that review but here's the rundown for those who missed it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest change on the latest version of the S40 UI is the new web browser. Borrowed from their Symbian smartphone elders, the WebKit-based app represents quite a shift in Nokia feature phones so we'll give it the quality time it deserves later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the internals have been updated to help with location based services and some things to make porting Java apps to the S40 easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite player has been updated to version 3 and Flash Lite content can also be used as 'organic' wallpaper. Nothing new, but the more options you have the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other things have been changed as well - a little UI polish, MMS ver. 1.3, message support of up to 600KB and better support for WMV and WMA codecs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A super fit phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia 6700 classic stores up to 2000 contacts and that should be more than enough. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. Caller image is different for incoming and outgoing calls. It fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: Normal Name List, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Image. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at once. Contacts can be ordered by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can be either normal or large, and it's an option that will definitely be appreciated. The bigger font fits just as many contacts on the screen by leaving a smaller gap between the lines. And lastly, the well-known grouping option is also present. This means that contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Ovi Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log on the Nokia 6700 classic is the well-known S40 application. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception is great and in-call sound is very clear with the Nokia 6700 classic. Like almost all current S40 midrange phones this one also features Voice Clarity which is another way of saying that it applies some sort of background noise suppression during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration strength on the 6700 classic is very good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, making video calls on the Nokia 6700 classic is impossible. There are some phones without a secondary camera that can still make video calls using the main one, in the case of 6700 classic that is not an option much like as it wasn't with the 6500 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has not included any Smart dialing features, so typing a number would give you the "helpful" option of starting a countdown timer (interpreting the numbers as hours, minutes and seconds) but sadly won't search through your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 6700 classic is an good performer. You can't count on getting just everything in noisier environments, and calm and subdued ringtones surely won't do. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is capable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department leaves us with little room for complaint. The Nokia 6700 classic is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS, MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can fill by simple typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to define a favorite message contact. One is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and organized in a practical time-saving manner. You enter a few letters of a contact's name and then click match. This brings up a list of matching contacts and selecting one prompts you to choose either a mobile number or an email address, then it will shift to the message body automatically where you can start typing. The T9 dictionary and the handy delivery reports go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the number count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will break down into displayed on the screen. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type. A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio messages have a separate editor, which can either record the message on the fly or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up an account with the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password, and the 6700 classic took care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice. There's an option to keep the connection active, then you will be notified for new messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is still the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 gallery has never been our favorite and even in the 6th edition, things have remained largely the same. The problem is that it is a lot better as a file manager than it is as a dedicated image gallery with fancy transitions and effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We understand that adding such effects would probably have slowed down the file manager considerably - so splitting the two would be something for Nokia to bear in mind for the 7th edition (and multitasking, obviously).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom in on it to see more detail. Zooming is a little faster than on previous devices, but it's still quite limited - it can only zoom in twice in large steps, so it is practically of no use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can also be viewed full screen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a very limited number of options (in contrast to almost every Samsung phone with their suite of editing features), so Nokia 6700 classic users are highly unlikely to take up photo editing on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available sideshow (called "Open in sequence", which gives you an idea of how feature rich it is) and Search option, which is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overflowing folders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the nicest applications on the Nokia 6700 classic. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported. The theme can be set to match that of the rest of the phone, integrating it very well with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of the Nokia 6700 also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB and naturally the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one default theme available for the music player if you don't count the five preinstalled themes for the UI. They change the color scheme and background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience is enhanced by equalizer presets. There are 5 equalizer presets on Nokia 6700 but you can easily create new ones thanks to the two user defined slots available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be active for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS but without loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia 6700 classic is the FM radio. It resembles the audio player interface and covers most of the basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, the FM radio also has the standard theme and the 'Set by Themes' option, which uses the currently selected UI theme. RDS support is available. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, there's no option to output the radio through the loudspeaker. You can play songs from your music collection through the loudspeaker, so why not the radio? We have no idea.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is kinda limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 6700 classic is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The option to hide soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also improves the viewing experience. The player works in the background appearing on the active standby tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately as we managed to find out, the Nokia 6700 classic is only capable of playing WMV files encoded with WMV3 codec. All other WMV files failed playback. Not to mention that competing feature phones by Samsung and LG already offer XviD and DivX video playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is among the best 5MP snappers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic is armed with a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus for image resolutions of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the mid-range spot. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash is only really usable with extremely close range objects and it can only be used as a flash, there's no option to use it as a video light. The shutter key can be half-pressed to focus before taking a shot, but that's about it - there aren't any metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also lacks a dedicated macro mode, but the camera manages to focus on text from about 9-10 centimeters away, which negates the need for such a mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not the fastest in focusing and the time it takes to save a photo is pretty average too. The images it produces are about 1.5MB for a 5MP shot, so you can't email a full-res photo due to size limitations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic image quality is very good, easily ranking among the best 5 megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasing colors and good contrast with the noise levels still remaining pretty good. The amount of resolved detail is also among the best we have seen on a 5 megapixel phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples so you can see for yourselves what a capable shooter the Nokia 6700 classic is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 6700 classic. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic has a small edge over the multimedia flagship Nokia N97 in both resolved detail and noise reduction algorithm. That again goes to confirm that what we have on our hands here is one of the best 5 MP shooters we have ever seen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording: low-framerate VGA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Nokia 6700 classic manages VGA resolution at 15 fps. The 3GP video clips length is only limited by the memory available. Unfortunately the video quality is far from stunning, with the low framerate taking most of the fun out of the VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the colors of the videos shot with the Nokia 6700 classic are pretty nice. Also, if you are willing to live with CIF resolution the handset can manage the more pleasing 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia 6700 classic sample video shot at VGA resolution (15 fps).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is fast<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity on the Nokia 6700 classic is up there with the best of them. What keeps it from being a complete all-rounder is the lack of Wi-Fi, though in some countries people might not even notice. The reason?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>10Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA, or in other words - very, very fast. There is of course the problem that those speeds are achievable in tests only, in real life they're much lower than those theoretical maximums. But look at it another way - operators are continuously upgrading their networks and you'll quite likely be able to take advantage of each improvement made by the time you decide to change your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet you shouldn't forget that data charges do apply everywhere so internet over the carrier network usually ends up more expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for frequencies, there's quad-band GSM support with tri-band 3G, which means the phone will work anywhere, with the 3G support failing only with networks that use rare frequencies (like T-Mobile USA's 1700MHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth with A2DP is hardly a surprise in this phone and the microUSB port that also acts as a charger plug is a plus. It also acts as an audio jack and the provided headset is a one-piece. Audiophiles wanting to use their own headphones will not be pleased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the end, there's the trusty microSD card slot with support for up to 16GB. For transferring large amounts of data it's the fastest option - for loading a new card this is the recommended course of action.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser is upgraded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic has an integrated WebKit-based HTML web browser and guess what? Apple's Safari and Mobile Safari are based on WebKit, as well as Google Chrome, the browser for the Android platform and the Palm Pre. The browser in the 6700 classic shares code with some of the best out there and doesn't disappoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 native browser still has its shortcomings though. The hardware is faster, or the software has been optimized, which means the scrolling is much faster and than on the Nokia 6303 classic, just don't expect anything like iPhone smoothness. Scrolling for more than a second brings up a minimap to help you navigate the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is also not supported - there's some rudimentary support but it's just enough to display certain banners, not play YouTube videos. For that you need to use the mobile version of the site and videos play through the Media player. All in all not a very pleasant experience. We forgave the 6303 this pitfall as it only had EDGE to rely on, but with 10Mbps HSDPA, we expected better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lack of landscape mode and Google (or any other engine for that matter) search is another downer of the WebKit web browser. A flaw that sticks out like a sore thumb is the font rendering - it's very rough and zooming out at even 75% makes the text almost unreadable, and at 50% even headings become very mangled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini still comes preinstalled - a tradition on S40 phones. And it has its place, despite the big improvements in the built-in browser. The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into a lighter format to the device, with the images compressed. While this spoils the quality somewhat, on a small screen (as most low-power devices that rely on the Mini have) you can't tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in quality aside, the compression really saves on data charges. For example, GSMArena.com clocked in at about 370kb through the built-in browser and just 70kb through Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both applications are preloaded and you can choose the one that suits you best.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 6700 classic is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Furthermore, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next-in-line is the handy To-Do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be assigned alerts, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia 6700 classic calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A lot of applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Download! application follows. This directly connects to the Nokia download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone, most of it free of charge. Don't worry, it still works despite the service getting integrated into Ovi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search initially, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Searching launches the web browser, which makes this app somewhat useless. Or rather, it would have been if the browser had this functionality built-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Messenger is included for your IM needs. If you don't like it you can always download something else with the Download! app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first, you'd be quite surprised to find things like Facebook and MySpace in the Collection folder in Applications. But they, like the YouTube icon, are just links that load a mobile version of the intended site in the built-in browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Flickr app that allows you to upload your photo's to the popular image sharing site. You can set it to downscale photos before uploading them to reduce the upload size. It's not a complete application, however, browsing photos is done through the mobile version of the Flickr site in the built-in browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Share and Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll have a look at Ovi Maps in the next section, but first we'll take a look at its sibling services - Ovi Share and Ovi contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Share allows you to share images, video and audio files. This type of service has become very popular and Ovi Share is Nokia's way of getting its foot in the door. It's free and you have access to unlimited storage. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is somewhat limited though in that you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the built-in one works quite well). Bear in mind that even 3 megapixel photos can cost you quite a lot at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts goes about giving you access to another of the Internet's most time-consuming services - instant messaging. Ovi contacts integrates tightly with the phonebook as a new tab and offers an IM client with a twist. You can search for people already registered with Ovi or send an invitation to anybody using Gmail since the Ovi contacts supports G-Talk, Google's own IM, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can even go as far as sharing your GPS location so your friends can see immediately where you are at that particular moment. Or you can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy but here's the stumbling block - S40 still doesn't have multitasking. And since Ovi Contacts is a Java app rather than a native one, you can give up any hopes of switching between it and the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have rigged a way around this - you have the option to remain online when you quit the app and new messages show up as notifications on the screen. Choosing to reply starts the Contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has a pleasant surprise - you can put Contacts on the homescreen, which shows the number of friends online and even a message when you receive one, complete with sound notifications for a contact comming online or receiving.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is a Nokia Maps rebrand. The whole thing is part of Nokia's integration of all their services into one. As for the app itself, it's more simplistic than the one on, say, the N86 8MP - no 3D view, no way to view satellite maps, no traffic information or city guides Maps allows you to browse maps, look up addresses and plan routes. The built-in GPS in the 6700 classic turns it into more than an electronic version of a paper map. It will offer you voice guided, turn-by-turn navigation in several languages - English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian come preinstalled and there's plenty of others which you can download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important note - it's not a free lunch, rather a 3 month trial. After that you'd need to purchase a license if you want to continue using the voice guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads, motorways, bridges and tunnels can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app cannot be used for pedestrian navigation, but you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. The contents of Favorites can have different icons and can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6700 classic was unable to get a satellite lock after several minutes, so we had to turn on the A-GPS option to give it a push in the right direction.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games - from puzzles to shooters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are five games preinstalled and they range from quick and simple to some slightly more serious. They should be enough to kill a few dull minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Bounce tales - a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brain champ is a collection of simple puzzles - a variant of Simon Says, simple math questions (such as 2 + 4 = ?). The puzzles may be simple but since you're running against the clock, things can still get pretty competitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seasweeper is a variation on Minesweeper, with submerged rocks taking the place of the mines and switches between a square and a hexagonal grid. It includes an arcade mode, in which you pick up bonuses and earn cash as you guide a fleet of ships through treacherous waters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An all time classic is here - Snake, version 3. It offers classic mode or adventure mode, which puts a slightly different twist on the game. There's even multiplayer mode over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more serious game is Tomb Raider: Underworld. It's a platformer but you have to solve puzzles along the way as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the end of this review it's less what we think and more how we feel about the Nokia 6700 classic. The honest truth is we fell in love with the phone the moment we opened the box. Mature and poised, business-like and trendy, the real classic styling seems to give the handset a very wide appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this train of thoughts the Nokia 6700 classic stands as a much more affordable (but equally stylish) version of the Nokia 8800 Sirocco. Amazingly thin it truly is, but you'd never guess that holding it in your hand. For such a compact device, the phone does have a nice heft to it. Add the top notch feel of metal in your hand and you get the sense of a very reliable and stylish gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for specs - they are excellent for a feature phone. The handset can cater to a younger audience with its IM features provided by Ovi Contacts, and to a more diverse crowd with its trouble-free handling of email and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lack of Wi-Fi hurts a bit, but what really limits its usability is the lack of a document viewer. Without it, the excellent handling of email is not much of a benefit in a business environment. The phone has the looks to come out of any pocket and keep its head up, but it's unlikely to compete with other feature phones that offer basic document viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, laptop tethering doesn't involve special software (other than the Nokia PC Suite) or additional carrier fees besides the data charges. We're not sure if this is going to be a commonly used feature but you can set it up in almost no time, so it's worth keeping in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's now have a brief look at the Nokia 6700 classic alternatives. First up is the obvious, cheaper option - the Nokia 6303 classic. It omits the fastest data transfers, has a lower-res camera, and Ovi Maps comes bare without built-in GPS. What you'd miss the most is the looks however - the 6303 is simply no match in that department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6303 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b matches most of the key features of the 6700. It offers a document viewer, but lacks the navigation software - it relies on Google Maps instead. With a distinct and bold styling, the Samsung bar sure looks a worthy rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S7220 Ultra b</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung handset, often mentioned in the context of fashionable candybars, is the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani. We won't fuss over the differences in specs - what matters here is the looks - and the Armani is supposed to bring it in spades. So, keep bringing it, says the Nokia 6700 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the Nokia 6700 classic is poised to be a strong seller - especially among the crowd that likes to simply walk into a store and pick a phone. The handset is truly hard to resist in person and photos rarely do it justice, let alone make the similar kind of impact. So, the Nokia 6700 classic is designed to appeal to your senses and marketed to appeal to your common sense. You've been warned.</paragraph>
