			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby was just the beginning of a lineup that appears to have no visible end. There is a Corby for the touchscreen addicts, a Corby for the music buffs, Corby for the heavy texters, Corby for the young, and one for their parents. That?s pretty much everyone, don?t you think? We guess there should even be a Corby for the bored-with-the-Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The founding member of the Corby wasn?t announced so long ago, but so much has been changed. Well, if you put the S3650 Corby and the recently announced B5310 CorbyPRO side by side you'll notice one thing that hasn't changed at all: design. But on the inside they are very different, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung CorbyPRO is meant for a different range of users altogether. It combines great texting and the intuitive touchscreen control tops that up with a nice connectivity package (such as HSDPA, Wi-Fi, GPS and a 3.5mm audio jack) and all that is delivered at a bargain price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Corby was all about design, about touchscreen, about budget. The CorbyPRO, on the other hand, has managed to keep all that but goes much further by adding some killer features that are well above the S3650 league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, now you get UMTS support with HSDPA which will dramatically boost web browsing. But the really big news here is Wi-Fi support. It is a great addition to the comfy QWERTY keyboard and the numerous social networking services that the phone gives you access to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the latest of the Corbies also has an integrated GPS receiver. You can use it for image geotagging as well as for navigation. Unfortunately, if you decide to use your CorbyPRO into a GPS nav device you'll have to solely rely on the preloaded Google Maps app or on a third-party Java alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to the Corby basics, we shouldn't forget to mention the 2.8" touchscreen. Well, it turned out to be resistive this time around but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The colorful UI is also aboard and, unfortunately, so is the fixed-focus camera (3-megapixel this time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The time gap between the S3650 and the B5310 is rather small but it was enough for the competition to release some good CorbyPRO rivals that offer a similar feature pack at nearly the same price. But before we come to that, there?s planty of Corby to cover here. Starting with the looks and feel of this Pro on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic side-slider Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO measures 105 x 56.8 x 15.7 mm and weighs 135 grams. That it's a mere 3 millimeters thicker than the original Corby - that seems like quite an engineering feat. However, the QWERTY keyboard does take its toll and the Pro weighs a good 45 grams more than the plain Corby variety.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the S3650, the B5310 is all plastic. It's a different form factor though and the increased weight actually works in its favor. The phone doesn't feel too heavy, it handles well and the weight distribution is just right for a comfortable hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the B5310 CorbyPRO makes it a S3650 Corby twin. The rear also looks quite similar. Another feature the Pro shares with the original Corby is the replaceable rear covers. Unfortunately, the Fashion Jackets aren't compatible across the Corby lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8" resistive touchscreen display takes centerstage on the B5310 front. It has a 240 x 320 pixel resolution, just like most touchscreen feature phones by Samsung (including the original Corby).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is middling: indoors the screen is quite good; however, we must say we expected better sunlight legibility. The CorbyPRO screen is comparable to the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. Another downside is the somewhat poor touch sensitivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find just the secondary video-call camera and the earpiece - there's no ambient light sensor to adjust the display brightness. Below the screen there are three hardware keys - two receiver keys on each side of the Back button. The hardware buttons on the CorbyPRO are exactly the same shape and size as on the original Corby and the Lindy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the CorbyPRO hosts the microUSB port (used for charging and computer connections) and two controls - the shutter button and the HOLD key, which is used to lock and unlock the touchscreen. There is enough space between the buttons and their shape is distinct enough for you not to mix them up. The Lock key is nicely raised and has a very pleasing soft press. The microUSB port is covered by a protective lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is on the top left side and right next to it is the volume rocker. Also on the left but beneath the battery cover is the hot-swappable microSD card slot, which can accommodate up to 16GB cards. We tried one and it ran just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top there is the 3.5mm audio jack while the mouthpiece is at the bottom. Also on the bottom we find a tiny slit for lifting up the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear features only the camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. Samsung call the back panel a Fashion Jacket, and will offer a number of exchangeable panels for the phone. You can't use the Fashion Jackets made for other models (such as the S3650 Corby).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 960 mAh Li-Ion battery. The battery is officially quoted at up to 8 hours of talk time and up to 560 hours of stand-by time. The only thing under the battery is the SIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rounded design works in favor of the CorbyPRO, whether you are talking or typing on the QWERTY keyboard. The weight is right and the phone handles nicely. Quite sensibly, the side-sliding keyboard accounts for most of the weight and allows a steady hand-hold when typing. The slider movement is sharp and even, no wobbles and creaks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pleasing QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO packs a four-row side-slide QWERTY keyboard, which is surprisingly good never mind the space constraints. The actual keys are set within a frame of very sturdy feeling plastic, which is supposed to sustain and endure the frequent slider action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing on the CorbyPRO is extremely comfortable: the keys are well sized and nicely convex, and have a very distinct press. Numbers are accommodated on the top row instead of using a numpad layout. The top row by the way enjoys plenty of headroom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard has dedicated shortcuts to web and messaging. The Arrow keys, Backspace, Enter and OK buttons make sure the keyboard can actually be used full-time for navigating the CorbyPRO menus. Overall, the humble midrange CorbyPRO boasts a full keyboard that easily puts to shame some heavyweight business messengers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz the Corby way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - the TouchWiz interface feels right at home on this touchscreen messenger, where fun and ease of use are key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B5310 CorbyPRO offers three different homescreen panes that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three small bars at the top of the screen. The whole thing works in both portrait and landscape: the screen rotates automatically when you slide out the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of those homescreens with as many widgets as you like. The different wallpapers are actually three parts of a single panoramic desktop, just like on the Samsung S8000 Jet for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the widgets are stored in a tray running down the side of the screen, which you can pull in and out as needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If any need to be removed, you simply drag them back to the tray. The nice accelerometer-based option to auto-align widgets by shaking the handset is at your disposal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the B5310 CorbyPRO interface is typical Samsung (or at least the latest revision seen on the Samsung S3650 Corby). You have a tab at the bottom of the display which holds the three or four contextual keys with varying functionality based on the currently active menu. There are also some nice animations and transition effects throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons, while sub-menus appear as lists. Listed submenus are scrollable with the arrow keys on the QWERTY keyboard too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself stretches over three different screens and is sweep-scrollable sideways. The reason that so much more space was needed is the fact that almost all apps are now brought to the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure. You will only need to dig deeper for the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO also supports multitasking, which means that Java applications can be minimized to run in the background. A long press on the center button brings up the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO also has the Smart unlock feature, previously known as Gesture lock. Smart unlock allows users to simultaneously unlock the phone and open a menu item, application - even dial a contact - just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each letter from A to Z can be set as a gesture by the user to perform the various actions in question. For instance, you can use it to start apps like the music player, messaging menu, the web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B5310 CorbyPRO sports a cute little theme designed especially for the young audience. You've already seen it in the original Corby. The Cartoon UI has neatly drawn icons and hand-writing font in the list menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names on the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony, video calling included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is excellent at its main job - making calls - we experienced no reception or voice quality drops for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are three virtual buttons - phonebook, more and back. When you type a number or look it up in the contact list, by tapping More you can access options such as voice call, video call, send message or add to phonebook. Of course you have the hardware call buttons too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has smart dialing, which only works though with numbers, not names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the dialer itself is not very interesting, there's a flashier way to dial. The Photo Contacts are shown as a stack of pictures. Tapping on a photo brings up a menu with options to start a voice call or send a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the B5310 CorbyPRO scored a very good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY-fied messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. You can either use the on-screen numpad (in portrait mode only) or you'd better go for the hardware QWERTY keyboard, which is quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a native email client. It failed to retrieve Gmail settings automatically so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending and receiving is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly for a device in this class, the CorbyPRO also sports Push e-mail. Naturally, being a Java app, the Emoze application works only when the app is open - but keeping it running in the background is easy thanks to the nice task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 comes with a preinstalled IM client, namely the Palringo JAVA app. A wide range of services are supported (including Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of social networking services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As promised by the manufacturer, the B5310 CorbyPRO comes with social integration disguised as four neat homescreen widgets - MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Bebo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All four widgets have similar interface - a big update button at the top, a text field for your current mood/status message and some buttons at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the MySpace widget the available options include checking your messages, getting into chat and adding friends. The Facebook widget offers checking your messages, adding new friends and its last option is poking a friend, while the Twitter widget has only two virtual keys - friends and followers. The Bebo widget packs a total of two buttons too ? for adding new friends and starting a message. The Settings button is available everywhere offering options for auto-refresh and adding a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the widgets aren't exactly full of features, but the basics seem well covered. They are more than enough to keep you connected to your social circle on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social networking integration stretches even further to having a dedicated item in the main menu. The Communities item gets you links to websites such as Facebook, Picasa and Flickr and the ability to directly upload files. You can also preset your login details so you don't have to enter them each time you access those websites or try to upload content from the file manager - the B5310 CorbyPRO stores your credentials for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much covers what Samsung have been doing in the social networking department. Unfortunately, there's still no full phonebook integration along the lines of the HTC Sense UI on the Hero and the HD2, or the MotoBLUR UI on the Motorola Dext.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter how limited, the controls available on the Samsung CorbyPRO allow you to chat, update your status, post tweets, upload photos and read your friends' new posts. Thanks to the hardware QWERTY keyboard typing is a pleasure and the 3G support with HSDPA as well as the support for Wi-Fi make tweeting, poking, etc so much faster.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The B5310 CorbyPRO's file browser can display the files and folders on the phone memory or the memory card, and both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds) to let the handset sort the memory contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you are not forced to follow this structure - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except for the root folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading the memory card is quick and won't bother users at all. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card initiatialization is surprisingly fast: regardless of the capacity, the B5310 CorbyPRO recognizes a memory card in 10-15 seconds. The phone comfortably handles a 16GB microSD card with thousands of different files. Working with the files on the memory card once it's initialized is fast enough to satisfy most users; however, speed does drop when the card starts filling up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic but useful gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some Samsung phones, the B5310 CorbyPRO has only one picture gallery. However, this isn?t an issue since the gallery it does have is fully functional. You'll most likely not miss the Photo browser despite its eye-catching qualities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B5310 CorbyPRO gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is really fast and responsive with no lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in is easy enough though not as responsive as we would have liked it to be. You have the one-finger zooming too and it seems to work better here than on the Samsung Lindy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To zoom in quickly from thumbnail size to 100% you can just double tap on the screen. If you repeat, the image will go back to thumbnail size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available. Thanks to the integrated accelerometer, you can switch to landscape view by tilting the phone or sliding out the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung B5310 is almost exactly the same as in the original Corby and hasn't been altered much from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated homescreen widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application with only a single tap. You can also start, stop and skip tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer department offers a long list of presets including pop, jazz, classic, mega bass, bass enhancement etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind, just like on the S5600. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And one more thing - let's not forget that the CorbyPRO also packs a standard 3.5mm audio jack so you can plug in your favorite headphones straight away. No adaptors needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO features an FM radio with RDS. The CorbyPRO radio app offers intuitive controls and has the Find Music recognition service implemented, which works much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio app is in the Applications menu but the Radio widget on the home screen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you could just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. All the basics are covered though, and that should really be enough as the screen size doesn't really imply first rate portable video watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MP4 videos but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. VGA resolution videos we tried were a no go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is pretty good generally, the handset scored excellently on most parts of our traditional test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is spot-on with very minor deviations at either end of the audible range. The stereo crosstalk is excellent and so are the noise levels and the dynamic range readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly high distortion levels are the only thing that separates the CorbyPRO audio output from perfection. They aren't too disturbing but we are still below average and so we have to point them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the table and the graph so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO features a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera for maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not have auto-focus, but it sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when it's on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately result in taking the picture. Instead, the camera just starts tracking the framed face. As soon as the person smiles, the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly among the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not some spectacular performer, but it's quite alright for a 3 megapixel snapper. Noise suppression is a bit too aggressive at times, eradicating all fine detail, but it seems passable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic, the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO performs slightly better, having a slight edge in both horizontal and vertical resolution. This is in no small part due to the more aggressive noise reduction of the 5530.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO are very poor - it maxes out at QVGA@15fps. Hardly any usable videos can be produced with those specs but the consolation is that the competing LG GW520 for example doesn't offer anything better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung B5310 video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-you-can-eat connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support - even though Europe is its main market at this point. The handset also has 3G with HSDPA aboard, as well as support for Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is also enabled and comes with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the majority of recent Samsung devices, the B5310 CorbyPRO sports a microUSB port. Upon a USB connection, the phone can be used in mass storage mode or PC suite mode (or Media player).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode, it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data while connected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO, like the Samsung Corby, features the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser, which is an in-house application. With full Flash support and the new one-finger zooming algorithm, it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-finger zooming works like a charm too. Of course you can also rely on double tapping a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in to it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to Flash and Java support, the new web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view. You can scroll by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The actual scrolling is very choppy and is perhaps the only downside to browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full Flash support extends to include full featured YouTube videos as well. Of course, you can always go for the light handheld version at m.youtube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with the Samsung B5310 there is only a single type of event available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo apps for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to miss it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung B5310 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only trial games, again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung recently, the B5310 CorbyPRO offers only a bunch of trial games - Rollercoaster 3D, PyramidBloxx, Crazy penguin, Brain Challenge 2, and Bobble Popper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other disappointment when it comes to applications is the lack of any preloaded GPS navigation software despite the phone having a built-in GPS receiver. Well, yes, you've got the Google Maps app but we all know what it can and can't do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Corby and the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO which showed up less than a month later are like brothers from different mothers. They are so much alike, yet so different. And it is exactly this versatility that keeps the Corby range up and running. A glance at all the Corby devices reveals something this article started with: there is a Corby for everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, having seen the CorbyPRO in action, we can safely conclude: there is a Corby that wants to be the top Corby. If you are into texting, into web surfing, into music and pictures, and want to give touchscreen a try but don?t want a smartphone, the CorbyPRO is a nice choice. Yes, the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO has a lot to offer, but why does it get the PRO label?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it's definitely not because the B5310 is the ultimate feature phone. There are some downsides but none of them are a deal breaker. It's all plastic and looks and feels a bit cheap, the camera lacks autofocus and the screen could have been a lot better (both in terms of size and image quality).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there?s one reason why it deserves to be called a Pro it?s a darn good one. The CorbyPRO has a QWERTY keyboard it can be proud of. In fact, it?s an absolute surprise given the relatively low cost, the plastic build and the not-too-demanding target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The current street price of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is somewhere below 300 US dollars. In its price group there are quite a few competitors to match it. Some of them have a side-slide QWERTY keyboard, while the others are candybar messengers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are keen on sliders, before you head for the store to buy a CorbyPRO you should also consider the following threesome: the LG GW520, the Samsung B3410 and the Nokia 6760 slide. All of them skimp on Wi-Fi support (the B3410 has no 3G either), the 6760 slide is a non-touchscreen phone and the GW520 has no 3.5mm audio jack. On the other hand, the B3410 is considerably cheaper, the 6760 slide is a smartphone and the GW520 comes with a much larger screen.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The other group of competitors feature the Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT, LG GW300 and the Nokia E63. None of them is a touchscreen and the CorbyTXT display is on the small side and has a shockingly low resolution. The GW300 has a worse camera and loses points due to its limited connectivity options. The E63 is a powerful yet affordable smartphone with rich connectivity capabilities so you might be willing to forgive the disappointing snapper.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, as you can see, there is a long list of competitors waiting to stand face to face with the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO. Some of them hold some really strong cards up their sleeves while the greatest strength of some others is simply that they cost a lot less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honestly though, the CorbyPRO has the form factor and the feature set to find itself right in the thick of heavyweight smart messenger action. No, we?re not saying it?s a viable alternative for QWERTY touchscreen smartphones ? no way. But it seems capable of carving its own niche and serving it well.</paragraph>
