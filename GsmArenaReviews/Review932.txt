			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the hot tickets at this year's IFA, the Sony Xperia Z is about to get the attention it deserves at ours. The smartphone left us feeling extremely positive the last time we met and we are hoping for more of the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony did give the Xperia Z1 all they got. The latest screen technology, the fastest chipset around, a spanking new camera module that does 20.7MP stills on a sensor that's twice as big as those of the competition and waterproofing that even puts the Xperia Z to shame. And it's all packed in one of the best bodies in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all the Xperia Z1 has going for it either. The full list of features follows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you have as good a foundation to build on as the Sony Xperia Z, it's easy to make a great phone. What's harder to pull off is delivering an upgrade that's worth the users' time and money. Well, we guess Sony didn't have a hard time improving on all important aspects of the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has one of the largest batteries in the 5" league and is probably the best looking Android phone there (the HTC One is a 4.7-incher, so even if you prefer metal to glass it doesn't really count). The smartphone also has the best-spec'd camera with the largest sensor and the highest pixel count and flagship-grade connectivity and processing power. Few smartphones match the Xperia Z1's Snapdragon 800 chipset and ample 3,000 mAh battery, so at least on paper, the Xperia Z1 is shaping up to be the smartphone to beat this season.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll only know for sure when the review is complete, but for now we are giving you a taste of the main menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony introduced new design aesthetics with the Xperia Z called OmniBalance and the Xperia Z1 brings the latest refinement. The chassis of the 5" flagship is constructed out of a solid slab of aluminum that's extruded, carved and anodized. After all this, all that's left is the rectangular frame to which all the ports, slots and buttons are attached (including the signature aluminum power button) and then two scratch-resistant sheets of glass are put on the front and back to finish the praised angular look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 measures 144 x 74 x 8.5 mm, which is a little bigger than the Xperia Z in all dimensions. Then again, when you consider that Sony has blessed the Z1 with a large 1/2.3" sensor and a 3,000mAh battery - the two smartphone features that drive the thickness up the gain is actually impassively modest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, a Nokia Lumia 1020 is 10.4mm thick not counting the camera hump (its sensor is twice as big though) and it only has a 2,000mAh battery. The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has a 1/2.3" sensor and is pretty chunky (by smartphone standards), though that's because of the optical zoom. We'll talk about Sony's answer, the QX detachable camera modules, later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Nokia and Samsung sacrificed the design and pocketability for the sake of the camera, Sony went the other way and put the best camera that would fit in. And the result is quite impressive indeed - with sensor twice as big as most competitors and resolution far higher than them, the Z1 camera is the best-spec'd this side of the Nokia PureView family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 shares much of the layout of its functional elements with the Xperia Z, although there are some key improvements that we greatly appreciate. Above the screen, you get the earpiece with the LED status light residing within it. The earpiece is flanked by the front-facing camera on the right, and the ambient light and proximity sensors on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Xperia Z1 relies on virtual navigation buttons rather than hardware ones, there's nothing of interest at the bottom. The primary microphone is nowhere in sight, so we assume it's underneath the large grille at the bottom that also holds the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker itself had to be moved to the bottom, because its place on the right side is taken by the dedicated camera key. The camera key is a bit on the small side and is not the most comfortable to press, but it's still much better than nothing as was the case with the Xperia Z. The Z1 is a proper cameraphone and Sony was keen to show it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the right are the power/lock key that has become a signature feature of the Xperia lineup lately, the volume rocker and a tiny flap that hides the microSIM slot. The flap is rather easy to operate and will cause no drama in those rare occasions when you are exchanging SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you get another an exposed 3.5mm audio jack, which is really a great step forward from the awkward plastic lid offered by the Xperia Z. The Sony Xperia Z1 actually has better water-resistance than the Z with its IP58 rating and the fact that it was achieved while improving usability is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the MHL-enabled microUSB with USB host support and the microSD card slot. The dock connector resides underneath the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, turning our eyes to the back we spot the 20.7 megapixel camera lens, which carry the Sony G-lens branding. There is small marking next to it indicate the larger sensor sitting underneath, while the LED flash sits just below the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the back cover sits a huge 3,000 mAh battery that should keep the new Sony flagship going for up to 15 hours of talk-time or 850 hours of stand-by on 3G networks. Both numbers are a market improvement over the Xperia Z, but we'll have to spend some more time with the smartphone and do a proper test before we find out its real life performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vastly improved display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now come to the most interesting part of the Sony Xperia Z1 hardware inspection. The smartphone comes with a 5" 1080p Triluminos display, backed up by the company's X-Reality engine. Sony has already demonstrated the potential of that combo with the Xperia Z Ultra, so we know that it's far better than the company's screens from the first half of the year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density breaks down to 441ppi, which is as good as it gets in terms of sharpness. No matter how closely you look, you won't be able to tell pixels apart and images will always look tack sharp (provided they have enough resolution in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key area that has saw improvement with the latest Sony display tech is viewing angles. Those have been a long-standing issue with all of the company's screens over the past few years, but now things are looking much better. You do get contrast compression when you look from very wide angle, but everything still remains legible. At this point the differences between this and the best screens in business is more about the high-tech vide that you get when the icons appear as if painted on the screen. In terms of usability though, the Xperia Z1 does as good as any of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native contrast of the Sony Xperia Z1 display is great and surprisingly much better than that of the Z Ultra. Colors are also nicely punchy, but still fairly accurate. If you'd like a bit of extra punch to your images and videos you should enable the X-Reality engine, which is the successor of the Mobile Bravia Engine. It aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while also boosting contrast and saturation and it does a pretty decent job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, the Xperia Z1 screen is much less reflective than those of its predecessor and the Sony Xperia Z Ultra. This, combined with its higher brightness helped the new Sony flagship smartphone to a great score in our dedicated sunlight legibility test. You will have very little issues with this one even in the sunniest of days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Sony Xperia Z1 screen may not earn it too many bonus point in today's market saturated with mind-blowing displays, but it's no longer a disadvantage as it was on the Xperia Z - in fact it even beats some of its rivals.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia Z1 runs on Android 4.2.2 out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with Android 4.2.2 out of the box and Sony's proprietary Xperia launcher on top. The most recent Xperia phones are already running or will soon get Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Sony Xperia Z1 to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area or using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The widgets in the Xperia Z1 do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applying a new theme changes the lockscreen and homescreen wallpaper and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The rightmost pane is special and fires up the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is on, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but they can be swiped out of the way. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. This time around, the toggles are customizable. You can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android task manager is onboard. It lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or you have the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android OS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, all of your multimedia content is saved too, and all system apps such as messaging, call logs, etc. get their data stored safely. Restoring is easy and if you lost something, you can easily bring it back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 is Sony's second device we meet running on the Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 800 chipset. It is powered by a quad-core 2.2GHz Krait 400 processor, with Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait 400 processor clocked at 2.2GHz (2.15GHz according to GeekBench) is among the fastest processors on the market, second to only the LG G2 (2.26GHz) and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (2.3GHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test is all about single-core performance, where the Xperia Z1 scored similar results to the other Krait 400-powered competitors.

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we put all four cores to the test in the multi-core version of the Linpack benchmark. The Sony Xperia Z1 didn't disappoint.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also run the GeekBench 3 CPU benchmark. The Xperia Z1 matched the score of its Xperia Z Ultra sibling, both occupying the top spots in our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 gauge the overall device performance instead of just the CPU and the Sony Xperia Z1 managed to conquer the first spots on both charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's time to test the new Adreno 330 graphic processing unit. We ran both GLBenchmark tests in offscreen mode, testing raw GPU power. The Xperia Z1 scored identical results to the Xperia Z Ultra and outpaced all other phones we've tested so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Epic Citadel benchmark was updated recently with the new Ultra High Quality setting. We've rerun every 1080p device we had around and, as we expected, the Xperia Z1 matched perfectly the Xperia Z1 Ultra and both are sharing the first place once again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the Sony Xperia Z1?s Chrome browser is our all-time second-best. The Xperia Z Ultra is the only phone with a better result.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combined BrowserMark 2 benchmark saw another great result by the Sony Xperia Z1, but this time it didn't manage to come on top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Xperia Z1 hit the third place on the Vellamo browser benchmark, just a whisker below its Xperia Z Ultra sibling and the LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is one of the fastest smartphones (phablets included) available on the market right now. There's a noticeable performance lead over the Snapdragon 600 competitors and the snappy chipset makes its presence felt in almost everything you do around the Android OS. Once you get your hands on the Z1, you can?t help but appreciate the muscle under the hood.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The 20.7MP camera is the star of the show<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 boasts a unique Exmor RS sensor, custom built for the latest flagship. It's the highest resolution available on an Android smartphone (beating the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom). It's a relatively large 1/2.3" sensor too, which should make a big difference in terms of noise performance and dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's beyond us is the fact that in Superior Auto mode the Sony Xperia Z1 shoots stills of only up to 3840 x 2160 pixels (read 8.3MP) as on previous smartphones, which had only 13MP cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's only in Manual mode where the resolution jumps to 5248 x 3936 pixels (20.7MP). We'll talk about the multiple shooting modes later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 uses a wide-angle (27mm) Sony G Lens camera with a bright F/2.0 aperture and a BIONZ image processor. Sony has literally equipped the Xperia Z1 with all the latest tech they have on tap, and that's just the hardware, the Xperia Z1 is very impressive on the software end, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, shutter keys for the camcorder and the still camera, and a front/rear camera toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all the extended settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia Z1 camera offers a plethora of built-in features, including face detection, smile shutter, geotagging, touch capture (with Burst option) and an HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera does once you press the dedicated camera shutter button when the phone is locked or in standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or camcorder mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video. This might come in handy for those occasions when you just can't afford to miss a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of shooting modes on the Sony Xperia Z1 aside from the Superior Auto. On the Xperia Z1 Sony has replaced the Normal shooting mode with Manual (in an obvious move to mathc the Nokia Lumia 1020). Also gone is Burst mode, now dubbed Timeshift burst. It captures 61 shots in just 2 seconds and the intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, Sweep panorama and you can also get fancy with the Augmented Reality effect. It paints a virtual world over your scene and can be quite entertaining (we'll take a look at it later on). Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see everyday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in a Goggle-esque twist, the Xperia Z1 has a feature called Info-Eye that can recognize text, business cards, QR and barcodes, landmarks, bottles of wine and even book covers, too. Sony has partnered with leading companies in the respective fields to provide info (e.g. Amazon for books, Vino for wines, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our short text sample it worked quite well. Sony has utilized the Google Now card design to show relevant information for what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the ex-Normal/now-turned-Manual mode you can actually set all settings to Auto (it hardly gets more confusing than that), but remember that Manual is just a marketing name, the more proper name would be Normal mode, which they used before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and the Manual mode when everything is set to Auto is that the Superior Auto tries to guess what kind of a scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode. The auto setting in Manual mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle manually with the other settings if you want to. But you can have them set to Auto if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. Our experience so far shows it gets things right almost every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've compiled a bunch of samples from the Sony Xperia Z1 camera for your viewing pleasure. The first two batches are taken in normal mode, read 20.7 MP, while the third is captured via the Superior auto mode in 8.3MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't be passing any judgments on the camera quality just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, here are the same scenes shot in Superior auto mode. As we mentioned, the resolution of the photos is 8.3MP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps and that's about it. With the inclusion of the powerful Snapdragon 800 SoC we would've liked to see 1080p video recording at 60 fps or even 4K but we guess that's just too much to ask from Sony at this point. In any case, there aren't too many 4K screens around yet, so it may not be such a big loss. 1080p is still competitive enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder app UI is practically the same as the still camera's. You can enable digital video stabilization ( which crops a little from the field of view), or set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has introduced a new camera feature dubbed SteadyShot to tackle cam shake. In our experience it worked as advertised, but we'll see in our full review if it can compete with full-blown optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at steady 29 frames per second with a good bitrate of 18 Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 132 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took several videos with the Sony Xperia Z1 for your viewing pleasure. It's a bit early to pass a verdict at this point - we'll need to do some more shooting (and in better weather) before we are ready for that, so we'll just let you enjoy the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video taken with the Sony Xperia Z1 in Superior Auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here's the same scene snapped in Manual mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also switched to the HDR video mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We managed to steal some quality time with the Xperia Z1 since Sony pulled the wraps off their latest flagship at IFA last week. Berlin sure was fun but we were itching to run our own benchmarks and shoot more samples. And, you know, not let the festive atmosphere and smell of new gadget at the IFA floor cloud our judgment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Xperia Z1 is definitely on the list of devices we'll be seeing more of in the coming days and weeks. And phones like the LG G2 and the Note 3 will help us put it in perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G2 ? Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the obvious, the Xperia Z1 is big - it's big even for a five-incher that is. The Z1 is almost the size of a phablet and the impressively compact LG G2 may have a thing or two to say about that. On a second thought though, the Z1 is very much in contention for the best-looking droid. Along with the HTC One, depending on whether you prefer glass or metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shouldn't forget the awesome build quality either, and the fact that the larger body accommodates a bigger battery and larger image sensor, on top of having superior waterproofing than its predecessor. The screen is a notable improvement too, with vibrant colors and great contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a Snapdragon 800 humming inside and 2 gigs of RAM, the Sony Xperia Z1 is a top-notch performer - response to user input is instant and the web browsing experience is flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera will have the upper hand in most shootouts when it comes to stills. There's no OIS but the larger sensor makes a big difference. The lack of high-framerate 1080p or 4K video recording is a bit disappointing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 is nonetheless the best smartphone to come from Sony yet and one that will easily build on the success of the Xperia Z. We are yet to see how it holds against the likes of the LG G2, but it certainly has a shot at the top spot.</paragraph>
