			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo held an event in India where they announced five new Android smartphones will be hitting the local market. The A60+, the K860, P700i, S560 and the S880. The phones span a wide price range, starting from around $120 for the cheapest A60+ to $530 for the most expensive K860.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were on site and we though you might want to see some live photos of the devices, garnished with our first impressions of them. To get you started we'll go through the keys specs of each of the smartphones, so you know what to expect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo K860<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The K860 is the top of the line model in Lenovo's smartphone range and comes with a quad-core Exynos 4412 processor and a 5.0-inch 720p display. The handset has a rather boring design with a slab-like shape devoid of any interesting visual design cues. The build quality, however, is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.0-inch HD display looks pretty impressive, with natural colors and wide viewing angles. It's on par with what we have seen on the Optimus 4X HD, although the One X still has the better LCD in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's software skin on top of Android 4.0.4 seems overdone with superfluous animations and a visual style that will win few beauty pageants. The quad-core does a decent job, however, with satisfactory performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Lenovo K860 web browser benchmarks compare to those of its quad-core rivals.

ul.jrGraph { left: 128px !important; }
ul.jrGraphControls { padding: 0; margin-left: -10px !important; }
 
var jrGraph_js_src = 'http://blog.gsmarena.com/wp-content/themes/gsmarena-v2-production/js/jrGraph/jrGraph2.js?v=5';

if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined' && typeof JQUERY_IS_LOADING == 'undefined'){
  JQUERY_IS_LOADING = true;
  lazyLoadScript('https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js', function () {
    lazyLoadScript(jrGraph_js_src, function () {
      doJrGraphs();
    });

  s.onload = doJrGraphs;
  document.head.appendChild(s);
  s.type ="text/javascript";

    $(document).ready(function(){
    	$('.jrGraph').each(function(){
	    $(this).jrGraph();
	});
        if (window.location.host.substring(0, 2) == "m.")
            $("ul.jrGraphControls").css("top", "-6px");
    });

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo S880<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the Lenovo S880 that has a 5.0-inch, 800 x 480 resolution display. Contrary to what it might sound, the display does not look all that bad and unless you have seen an HD display you should be fine with this display. The design of this phone is much more attractive than that of the K860 and the build quality is just as good but the phone feels unnecessarily bulky, which, coupled with its size makes it feel unwieldy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side, the S880 has similar UI modifications as the K860 but the single-core MTK 6575 isn't nearly as powerful and it shows in the UI, which isn't as smooth or fast as on the K860.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo P700i<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The P700i comes a bit further down the line and has a 4.0-inch, 800 x 480 resolution display and dual-core MTK 6577 processor. The handset has a simple and minimalist look with the same exceptional build quality that we have seen on all Lenovo phones today. Like the S880, the P700i also feels a bit heavy but is manageable due to its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again we see Lenovo's customized skin on top of Android 4.0.4 and this time it goes even deeper, with a completely custom design for the browser with tabs on top. Lenovo's aesthetic taste remains questionable, which makes some of these changes less than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-core processor on the P700i does a decent job and the phone manages to get around without getting bogged down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo S560 live photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S560 is another MTK 6577-powered offering by the Chinese company. It offers a 1GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU and PowerVR SGX531 GPU, which combined with the low HVGA resolution give you a pretty smooth ride.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo A60+ live photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo A60+ is the cheapest of the lot, which explains why its specs sheet isn't particularly exciting. A 3.5"? LCD of HVGA resolution at the front and a 1GHz Cortex A9 inside are complemented with a 2 megapixel camera and just 256MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A60+ also had a custom skin on top of the OS but it was different than what was going on with the rest of the phones here. It was also the only one running Android 2.3 Gingerbread, which is inexcusable despite the price tag. As for the performance, it was a bit of a mixed bag, with the UI lagging occasionally despite the presence of a dual-core processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wrap-up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We think it's good that Lenovo decided to launch a phone at nearly every important price point but the phones aren't highly impressive. Other than the excellent build quality and the above average displays, we didn't find anything that stood well above the competition. It seems that Lenovo will need to work harder if it intends to attract a significant number of customers away from the dominant brands such as Samsung and HTC.</paragraph>
