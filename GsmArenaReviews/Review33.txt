			<paragraph>Mini is the John Smith of names in mobile phones these days. All makers in the Big Five are keen to have a diminutive version of a popular handset but if there is one to be the definitive repack, it would be the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You know, a couple of millimeters on each end are obviously enough for Nokia (N97 and N97 mini). Even the HTC HD mini isn?t that much smaller than the Touch HD. But when Sony Ericsson go mini they mean it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X10 mini is here to show how a mini phone should live up to its name ? sheer smartphone power in a half-size package. There?re always sacrifices involved to fit the new cut but if size is what matters it?ll hardly get any better than that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 Mini at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, there are downgrades in most departments compared to the original XPERIA X10 but those are never too painful, especially if they?re reflected in the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might argue that the 600 MHz processor is nowhere near as impressive as a 1GHz Snapdragon but the X10 mini doesn?t seem underpowered at all ? screen resolution makes quite a difference. In fact, it is the most capable handset with a QVGA screen to date and we have seen those kinds of devices perform admirably on weaker CPUs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course this is all on paper and we all know a handset is more than a spec sheet can tell. We?re about to see if the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini (now that certainly is a long name for such a small phone) will cash the checks its features wrote.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 83 x 50 x 16mm the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini sure is tiny. There is hardly a pocket that won?t find enough free space for it and the mere 88 grams of weight will almost make you forget it is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might frown at the 16mm of thickness which is too much by today?s standards but it doesn?t really make the device unattractive. It almost looks like the boxy appearance was exactly what designers were looking for. Thinner than that and the phone would?ve been near impossible to handle comfortably. And the X10 mini is truly the smallest handset we have had recently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s all a matter of personal taste how you feel about the X10 mini. The boxy handset is quite different than most of its competitors. Manufacturers would usually go for tall slimmer bodies for their touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini won?t earn it many points either, especially against metal-built phones, but is decent. The back is nicely fingerprint-resistant with rubbery finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shiny plastic on the front does become greasy with use (it doesn?t take too long) but, since the front is mostly taken by the display anyway, we are willing to let that one go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen itself measures 2.55? in diagonal, which seems like the very minimum that still allows finger-use. Sony Ericsson did well though to make the best use of the screen estate with the interface. We?ll get back to that later but the icons are all large enough and you won?t have trouble pressing any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen sensitivity, as was to be expected in a capacitive unit, is excellent. The slightest of touches is enough for a click to be registered, for a great touchscreen experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equally important, the QVGA resolution is adequate for this screen size but doesn?t allow for too fancy graphics. For example, most of the icon labels don?t look sharp enough and the icons themselves are not as smooth as we?ve seen on HVGA and WVGA Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 65K-color limitation inherent to Android versions prior to 2.0 could result in the occasional banding but it?s not as easily noticeable on a screen this size. If the X10 mini ever receives an Android 2.0 update those issues will be completely solved but we wouldn?t hold our breaths just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is passable as far as TFT displays go, with good brightness and above average contrast. Anyway, an AMOLED display would?ve made sense on the full-grown XPERIA X10 but is obviously too much for the mini league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the sunlight legibility of the X10 mini display is pretty mediocre. There are just too much reflections and operating the handset outdoors on a bright sunny day is pretty troublesome.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys ? contextual menu, home and the back button. Those are thin buttons but nicely raised and with good press feedback. The obvious absentee is the Search button: in exchange there?s a search widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a status LED, the earpiece and the proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is in charge of locking the display when you hold it next to your ear during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is completely bereft of controls. The only thing of interest here is a small groove to pull the battery cover off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right you get a volume rocker and a shutter key. The volume rocker is as good as the three keys below the display but the camera key is a bit too tiny. It still has a proper stroke though and very distinct half press. It?s not bad at all, just needs some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the handset is the screen lock key which also acts as a power button. Again, it isn?t the most comfortable to press but we suspect it was done on purpose to minimize accidental presses. More than often it needs a push with a fingernail really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini has the audio jack and the microUSB port. The audio jack is absolutely compatible with standard 3.5mm plugs but the unusual shape accommodates the X10 mini prebundled headset. There is a protective cap over the microUSB port, while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. The loudspeaker also goes in here, slightly to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment. The microSD slot is hot-swap enabled but the bad news is the battery isn?t replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only is carrying a back-up battery out of the question but effectively once the original battery runs its life span you?ll have to buy a new phone. You?re more likely to upgrade long before the battery expires anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage we are unable to comment on the real life battery performance of the X10 mini. It?s quoted at up to 285 hours of standby and 4 hours of talk time in a 2G network. In 3G mode, it?s up to 360 hours of standby and three and half hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is so tiny you can cup it in your hand and out of sight. It?s brilliant to handle and makes you want to cuddle it. Some users might find awkward making calls on something that small but otherwise working on such limited touchscreen estate is trouble free. There are inevitable compromises of course, like no virtual QWERTY keyboard, but the little chap sure is hard to resist.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: perfect fit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini runs version 1.6 of the Android platform just like the rest of the X10 gang. There is nothing out of the ordinary but what makes the mini special is the QVGA resolution which is pretty rare on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness, Android doesn?t look as pretty on 320 x 240 pixels but this certainly isn?t a deal breaker. Sony Ericsson have done a good job of customizing the interface and making the icons large enough, given the limited screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They have opted for more screens rather than downsizing the tiles, which, even if a bit slower, is the more comfortable option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini packs the Timescape UI plug-in but lacks the Mediascape that is only reserved for its full-grown sibling for now. In fact, Timescape is a separate application but its job is to bring all your communications together. It always displays an aggregated view of your SMS, MMS, email, missed calls, Facebook and Twitter updates all on one screen. It also has a large number of tabs that can filter the content by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, Sony Ericsson have managed to make best use of the limited screen estate by adding large thumbable shortcuts at the four corners of the homescreen. Those lead to the message composer, music player, phonebook and dial pad/call log. The tiny Android is obviously short of hardware keys but they?re not badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has also been affected by the size factor. You are limited to widgets only ? no shortcuts or folders are allowed and you can only add one widget per screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the number of available homescreen panes isn?t limited so each time you add a widget a new screen appears. You can then rearrange the screens as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, Sony Ericsson R&amp;D have found enough space for the notification area, which we consider to be one of the best Android features. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. Sliding it down however reveals the whole story - you get a list of all recent notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the X10 mini you press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It gives you access to the six most recently used apps although, due to the specific operation of the operating system, some of them might be hibernating rather than actually running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the actual performance is surely where the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is nothing short of impressive. Regular HVGA resolution and a 528 MHz CPU that most other droids use surely ensures a decently smooth Android run. But when you cut the number of pixels in half and crank up the clock speed a bit and, the thing starts flying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited text input puts the brake on messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini isn?t the heavy texters? choice. The software is just fine, but with the limited text input options long messaging sessions are out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini you are limited to a standard multitap keypad and given the available screen estate we don?t think a virtual QWERTY would have made any sense. Not on a capacitive screen anyway, where stylus is a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, the X10 mini pro should be the choice for those that actually do more than an occasional SMS on their phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is pretty basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite boasting a new design the music player on the XPERIA X10 mini didn?t get much in terms of new features. It manages your audio files decently but there is very little extra functionality to support that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best bit is the shortcut key that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search by holding down a finger on a song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t even gradual typing for searching a specific song this time so you will have to use the kinetic scrolling or opt for artist sorting. At least there are three smart playlists that automatically gather your newly added, most played and never played tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still a lot of shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. For example there are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plain 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini has a 5 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels and a LED flash. It doesn?t sound like much but the size of the package says it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is as simple as it gets with four buttons in total. There is a camera/camcorder switch, a gallery button, scene mode and flash settings. The four available scene presets include twilight, sports, landscape and, of course auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is certainly one of the most basic camera interfaces on the market but we guess Sony Ericsson thought users wouldn?t need much more and will prefer simplicity to functionality. In the end, it all comes down to the image quality, so let?s see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is pretty pleasing with a good amount of resolved detail and the noise levels kept well under control even in not so favorable lighting. Contrast on the other hand is somewhat low.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the X10 mini goes as high as VGA resolution which, needless to say, is far from impressive. At least the framerate is good 30 fps to make sure action looks smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the video quality turn on and off the video light and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in 3gp format suggesting lower bitrate, which in turn leads to some compression artifacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser needs a higher-res screen and Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini is an Android phone and an excellent web browser is an important part of that description. With the exception of Flash, the browser performs pretty decently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is rather minimalist ? all you get on the screen are the zoom controls. The address bar is hidden by default to save some space as the low resolution doesn?t allow too much content to fit on the screen anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Android browser on the X10 mini supports only a single zoom method ? the dedicated onscreen buttons. There is no double tap or one-finger zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the browser supports text reflow ? as soon as you zoom, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and four keys pop up. You can open/switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash support is the other letdown of the X10 mini browser browser. There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you're experimenting you want to make sure you minimize mistakes. Well, the first thing about the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is it just can't be a big mistake. In fact, the only way for it to go wrong would be the price. The pint-sized package may be taken to imply half price. Let's be clear though: it may be a dwarf droid but it still is a full-featured smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this experiment could well be a success. They tried to create a mini handset without sacrificing performance and they simply nailed it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-optimized interface makes great use of the limited screen estate and the performance is excellent. As snappy as they get, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini only has a few things missing on its specs sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's why it's a particularly easy handset to recommend - if you are happy with the specs, you might as well go ahead and buy it - the phone will deliver. There won't be any nasty surprises and the handset even has a trick or two up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it even simpler - the XPERIA X10 mini is not burdened with the kind of responsibility the original X10 will have to deal with. Instead it brings all the smartphone basics, garnished with a snappy CPU and served in a body that every pocket can take.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may be that Sony Ericsson have found an empty niche in this busy market. The XPERIA X10 could be too unusual to catch on, too small to get noticed but certainly not afraid to make a stand.</paragraph>
