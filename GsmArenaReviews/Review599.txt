			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is hardly a surprise that the third generation Motorola Moto G is one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2015. After all, in less than two years after the first iteration of the smartphone (Moto G became the most successful phone in the company's history) made its debut, the Moto G product family has successfully redefined what a budget Android handset should look, feel, and perform like and how much it should cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to stay on top of this highly competitive smartphone segment, the Moto G (3rd gen) packs a considerably improved hardware in comparison to the outgoing model, while keeping the same $179.99 starting price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newcomer features a beefier 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset and 2GB of RAM on board, as well as a 13MP main camera with 1080p video capture and 5MP front-facing unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the above specs are not the new Moto G's trump card. The device's IPX7 water-resistant body and customizable colors promise to put the smartphone head and shoulders above its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its predecessor which was an evolutionary upgrade over the first generation, the Moto G (3rd gen) has taken a massive leap forward hardware-wise. The handset's 64-bit chipset and the available 2GB of RAM promise to fully utilize Android Lollipop, while the 13MP main camera will likely punch above the device's price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to customize the XT1540 Moto Maker and the IPX7 certification are a first for the Moto G family. In addition to being attractive for current Moto G owners looking forward to upgrade, the features open Motorola to an even wider audience of potential customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year's Moto G is one of the first major products that Motorola launched with Lenovo at the helm. At a quick glance, it appears that the Chinese tech giant has kept the same winning formula that Google introduced during its tenure as an owner of the storied American company and will further augment with the retail distribution chain they already have in place throughout the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we'll kick our review off with an unboxing of the new Moto G, followed by a closer look at its design and hardware. Head over to the next page to find out if the smartphone lives up to the promises delivered by its feature set!</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like older members of the product family, the new Moto G comes in a rather basic retail package. Inside the small retail box, you will find only a wall charger and a couple of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional bundled accessories have never been a Moto G series forte and the third generation is no exception. Considering the device's price tag however, we don't believe the one should be too picky about free headphones or a protective case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the new Moto G is unmistakably a Motorola. However, the newcomer's polycarbonate frame brings it closer to last year's Moto X in terms of looks. We find this to be a great thing, as the third generation of the budget smartphone carries a premium aura which its predecessors simply did not possess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola's slightly curved body and signature dimple have once again made it to the new Moto G. Overall, we find the smartphone to be a handsome bloke with plenty of character.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Moto Maker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moto Maker is another major Moto G (3rd gen) highlight, as well as a major breakthrough in the handset's price segment. Introduced alongside the first Moto X back in 2013, the customization program allows users to deck out the new Moto G in a color combo of their choice just before purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in the Moto X (2014), users can choose from white or black front panel. The former comes with a silver frame, while the latter features a dark gray solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera accent on the back of the smartphone can be customized as well. The colorful back covers can be swapped anytime - there are no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the available color combos in Moto Maker</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Moto G feels superbly put together. Thanks to the IP rating, the textured removable back cover of the device feels as if it's an integral part of it. The entire front of the smartphone is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, so scratches from casual use are not as likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto G's IPX7 rating means that the handset can survive a dip in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes, so long as its back cover is tightly sealed. Kudos to Motorola for achieving that without sealing all ports with ugly and cumbersome protective caps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With physical measures of 142.1 x 72.4 x 11.6mm, the new Moto G has a slightly larger footprint than the second generation. At 155 grams of weight, the newcomer is only six grams heavier than its predecessor, despite being waterproof and with significantly bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Moto G (3rd gen) is a pleasure. The device feels grippy and secure, so a user can perform most common tasks with one hand. Motorola's custom gesture controls are also quite helpful on this instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the new Moto G has similar controls as its predecessors, as well as just about every other Motorola smartphone available at the moment. The overall layout is intuitive and easy to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the earpiece and the 5MP front-facing camera reside. The ambient light and the proximity sensor are also located there. Below the screen is the single loudspeaker of the smartphone. This time around, Motorola has unfortunately ditched the stereo speakers of the second generation Moto G, probably for the sake of a bigger battery and the IPX rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is absolutely nothing on the left side of the smartphone. The power/lock key and the volume rocker are both located on the right side. The former has a distinctive texture, so it is easy to tell apart on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the smartphone is home to the 3.5mm audio jack, as well as a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation. A microUSB port sits alone on the bottom of the Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customizable strip on the back of the smartphone is home of the 13MP main camera with dual-LED flash and the signature Motorola dimple. It is interesting to note that, other than the small "M" on the dimple, there is absolutely no other manufacturer logo on the new Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the micro-SIM and the microSD card slot. The 2,470mAh battery of the device is not removable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like its predecessor, the new Moto G features a 5" IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The latter deliver a pixel density of 294ppi which, while not mind-blowing, is the norm in the handset's price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display's contrast and viewing angles are stellar for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness or the third Moto G is pretty much the same as on its predecessor on both 50% and 100%. We measured 430 nits brightness when the slider is set to 100%, but as it turned out that's not the maximum screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we illuminated the ambient light sensor, the screen went even brighter at 539 nits. This is good for the sunny days and will boost the legibility. The brightness limitation may be necessary to prevent display overheating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blacks are deep enough, though far from impressive. Still for this price range we can consider them as very good - deeper than the previous Moto G's the Xperia M4 Aqua and Redmi 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the contrast ratio is great, the color reproduction is accurate and you'll enjoy lively images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen glass isn't too reflective but the sunlight legibility isn't great. The Moto G 3rd Gen's display is still usable outside and you will be able to see what's happening on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moto G (3rd gen) has a significantly larger 2,470mAh battery than its predecessor (last year's iteration has a 2,070mAh unit). Combined with the energy-sipping 64-bit chipset and stock Android Lollipop, the new power cell propelled the smartphone to an impressive endurance rating of 76 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that the smartphone will last a tad over three full days if used of an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. In our experience, the handset easily made it through a full day of heavy use - enough for most of the users if you believe market research companies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the new Moto G has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G globally to cover the basics. There are also CDMA-enabled models. This time around, 4G LTE is also standard even on the cheapest variant of the device - compatible bands will vary in each market of availability. A Dual-SIM option of the device will also be available in markets where the solution is popular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on board is Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi b/g/n with Wireless Hotspot support. Wired connectivity is covered by a microUSB 2.0 port with USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although it is missing some of the more advanced connectivity features like NFC and IR-port, or Wi-Fi ac, the 2015 Moto G does have an FM radio, as well as SatNav with GPS, GLONASS and Beidu support. In short, the smartphone has all the basics covered and then some more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) boots stock Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Motorola prefers vanilla Android UI with minor improvements, so it is able to provide timely firmware updates. Take a quick look at the device in action in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has a new cool way to display notifications without waking up the screen. The feature is called Notifications at a Glance and is very similar to Lumia's Glance screen but it's even cooler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whenever the phone registers you're taking it out of the pocket or picking it up from a table, it lights up a clock on the locked screen, flanked by icons for any missed notifications. Tapping and holding such an icon reveals more information and details. All this happens without waking up the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other two exclusive Moto features include quickly twisting your wrist to activate the camera, chopping gesture to utilize the LED flash as a flashlight, and activating dedicated sound profiles at night or when you're in a meeting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a usual Android affair - you change wallpapers, add/remove widgets, create shortcuts. The leftmost pane is reserved for Google Now. All the apps are stored into a comfy app drawer, sorted alphabetically. There is no option for custom order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One finger swipe from the top of the homescreen will open the notification area, which features a clean look in Android Lollipop. Additional swipe reveals quick toggles that include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode, screen auto-rotate, flashlight, location on/off, and the option to cast the screen. Of course, you can also adjust the brightness of the screen and go into the settings menu too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher has a neat card interface that allows you to select the app you need by swiping up or down. You can close apps by swiping left or right, or by hitting the dedicated button on the top right corner of each card. Each Chrome tab now appear as a card, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now is summoned by an upward swipe from the virtual Home key. It is also available as a homescreen - the leftmost one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser and other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is unsurprisingly the default browser in the new Moto G. Its design matches the material look and feel of Android Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual organizing tools are present as well - there is the massively capable Google Calendar, a neat Calculator, and Clock (alarms, world clock, timer, stopwatch). A proper File Manager app is missing though so you'd have to download one off the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no office editor out of the box. However, Google's highly capable Docs is available for free in Google Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Migrate app will help you transfer contacts, messages and multimedia from other Android devices or iPhones. The app is easy to use and</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being easy to update, the stock Android build of the new Moto G is also a blank canvas for user customizations. With a plethora of quality launchers, icon packs, and wallpapers available, each owner can tweak the device's UI to their liking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto G (3rd gen) packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset with 1.4GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 306 GPU and 2GB of RAM. A version with one gig of RAM is also available, though we highly suggest that you spend an extra $40 and get the top-end Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we kick off our performance routine with the GeekBench 3 test, which gauges the multi-core CPU performance. The does quite well here, especially when compared to similarly priced offerings..</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu 5 test puts the Moto G (3rd gen) in line with similarly equipped competitors. The device's chipset does better than its predecessor's, but doesn't quite match the performance of some of its rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BaseMark OS II 2.0 is quite intensive benchmark, which puts to the test CPU, GPU, memory, system and browser performance. The Moto G posted an average score on this instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single and multi-core CPU breakdowns from the BaseMark OS II 2.0 once again put the faster Xperia E4g on top, but the Moto E is quite comfortable at the runner-up spot.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) comes with Adreno 306 GPU in charge of graphics. Our previous tests indicates it's as good as the previous Adreno 305 unit, meaning that it is not that great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p offscreen performance on the other hand is quite disappointing, but that's to be expected. The onscreen performance naturally gets better as the resolution drops to 1280 x 720 pixels. While the Moto G won't break any performance records, it is OK for the class and will do the job for gaming and watching movies.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Even though it is anything but a benchmark-crushing monster, the new Moto G delivers fluid system experience, great web browsing and solid gaming experience. Overall, the Moto G (3rd gen) offers a lot more than we hoped for in terms of hardware oomph.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contacts manager features tabbed interface, which displays all contacts and the favorites. You can sync with multiple accounts including Google and Exchange. A button to add a new contact is constantly present in the bottom right corner - you can choose which account to sync the new addition with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app comes with a tabbed interface for speed dial, recent calls and all contacts. The dialer is invoked by taping on its dedicated key and supports smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Moto G offers high in-call volume. Its sole loudspeaker is sufficiently loud and scored a Very Good mark on our test. Its audio quality is excellent - the sound is deep and sounds great inside a room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is pretty much as straightforward an affair as on every other droid out there. The generic Email app is being decommissioned in favor of the Gmail app. If you tap on its icon, it will tell you the Gmail app is the client that will handle all your emails from now on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, Motorola has opted for its own messaging app. We found its interface to be inferior the one found in Google's own Messenger app. Thankfully, the latter is available for free in Google Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the default Google keyboard is on board as well. It offers two sleek-looking, brand new skins - Material Dark and Material Light. The duo matches the new look of Android Lollipop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola's proprietary Gallery is the default image explorer on the Moto G (2nd Gen). Its browsing interface is very basic, but there are powerful editing options. It handles videos, too, as there is no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Photos is onboard as well with unlimited backup of your images. Upon opening the app you'll see two tabs - one for all photos and another one for highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single photo gives you a number of options. You can share it, set it as wallpaper or contact photo, or edit it. The built-in Photos editor is incredibly powerful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both galleries handle video files, as Android Lollipop lacks dedicated video app, and are equally capable. Available video decoders include Xvid, DivX, H.263, H.264 AVC (MKV files), and MPEG-4. The app will play most major file formats, though serious video fans should certainly seek out a more capable solution from the Google Play, as the lack of AC3 audio support is quite limiting. Subtitles aren't supported either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Play Music is the default player for your tunes on the Moto G (3rd gen). The app has been treated to the new material design, though it functionality remains unchanged - it can play your local files, as well as stream music from the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tweak the sound via the built-in equalizer. There are dedicated toggles for surround sound and bass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Moto G also has stereo FM radio with RDS. The app offers a sleek and intuitive interface and even allows users to record their favorite radio shows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is mostly clean, not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) started very well in our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier it posted excellent scores top to bottom and if it wasn't for its below-average volume levels it would have been a perfect showing. Still, there are few louder phones in this price range so we are happy with the Moto G here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones has a rather disastrous effect on stereo quality with crosstalk rising to very high levels. The other readings remained unchanged, but that's a pretty big issue to be overlooked and we can't give the Motorola handset full points here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the detailed results so you can check them out for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A capable 13MP snapper with dual-LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Moto G packs a 13MP main camera with f/2.0 lens and dual-tone LED flash. Even on paper alone, the newcomer's photography package promises to be a massive improvement over the 8MP snapper found in last year's iteration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does have the same minimalist interface as on the Moto X and E, which includes just two on-screen buttons on the right-hand side for video recording and front-facing camera. Taking an image is done simply by tapping the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available advanced settings include HDR with available auto mode, touch capture, panorama, geo-tagging, widescreen mode, and shutter sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The twist gesture to launch the camera that debuted in the Moto X two years ago has finally made it to the Moto G series with the third installment. Motorola has expanded the gesture's functionality even further this time around - a second twist right after the first one switches to the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto G 3rd gen camera is a quite similar to the one on the Nexus 6, though there is no OIS and the optical system seems slightly inferior. The images produced are a noticeably noisier than the one by the Nexus 6 and there is corner softness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we're quite impressed that manufacturers are now able to deliver consistently good image quality at this market price point of around $200/?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are some more camera samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording is finally a go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are happy to report that 1080p video capture has finally made it to the Moto G series with the third generation. The resolution is now the default choice for the smartphone - 720p in slow motion is the other available option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is exactly the same as the still camera one. One you launch the camera, you simply tap on the key in the top right corner to begin recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample shot by the Moto G 3rd gen. We are pretty happy with the camcorder, as the videos are smooth and pretty good level of detail and accurate colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample 1 (10s ~ 20MB) and 1080p@30fps video sample 2 (11s ~ 21MB).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3rd gen Moto G is the most capable member of the popular product family to date. Thanks to its zippy chipset, excellent camera and battery life, up to date stock Android, and superb build quality, the newcomer is also one of the most appealing entries in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike last year's rather conservative second generation, Motorola has really pushed the envelope with the latest Moto G. Newly introduced features like Moto Maker and IPX7 water resistance help the smartphone stand out in its overly crowded segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qualcomm's 64-bit Snapdragon 410 chipset proved to be a considerable upgrade over the 32-bit Snapdragon 400 found in last year's Moto G, especially when paired with 2GB of RAM. At no point did we get an impression that the smartphone needs more hardware oomph. Then again, graphic-intensive gaming titles will perhaps be taxing on this lower-midrange chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's battery life truly caught us by surprise. Yes, we did expect the new Moto G to do better than its predecessor in out battery test, but scoring an endurance rating of 24 hours more than its predecessor is as sweet as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera performance is impressive too, especially when compared to last year's model. Coupled with the intuitive gesture controls and clean interface, it truly allows the new Moto G to punch above its weight in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really wish that Motorola had brought NFC and speedier Wi-Fi to the new Moto G. The standard LTE connectivity however, is a welcome addition to the device's feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 1080p display would have also been a welcome sight, as some of the Chinese competitors of the new Moto G offer the feature. Considering the low starting price tag of the device however, many will consider our grief as simply nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of starting price, the Moto G (3rd gen) costs as little as $179.99&#x431;?199 for an unlocked device with a gig of RAM and 8GB of expandable storage. Spending an additional $40 will get you a variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage - the model that makes most sense to go for. The device's price tag tops out at $225/?250 for a fully customized 16GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we took a look around at some of the Moto G competitors in its price range. Here are some of the ones worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML variant with 2GB of RAM costs only $199 and brings 5.5" 1080p display, a more powerful Intel SoC, and a capable 13MP camera. The Taiwanese offering however, lacks water resistance and lacks the charming looks of the new Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note is a strong contender from China that handily beats the new Moto G on specs. Limited global availability and no IPX rating however, will likely prevent the m2 note from being a full-blown Moto competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) and Idol 3(4.7) are also worthy alternatives of the Moto G, with stereo speakers and higher resolution display (in the case of the 5.5" variant). However, the Alcatel duo lacks IPX rating. Its UI on the other hand, takes a bit of getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML ? Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) ? Meizu m2 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of these devices are considerably larger than the Moto G 3rd Gen but have superior specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are after a more pocketable alternative, you should perhaps look at Xiaomi Mi4i, Meizu m2, Samsung Galaxy J5, and of course, Sony Xperia M4 Aqua.</paragraph>
