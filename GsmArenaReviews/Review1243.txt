			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The final member of AT&amp;T?s LTE smartphone 2011 lineup is at the start line, ready to impress. The HTC Vivid is joining the company of the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket and LG Nitro HD in a bid to defend the reputation of the Taiwanese company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware wise, the HTC Vivid is a familiar sight. The smartphone is essentially put together from the parts? bin of the HTC Sensation 4G and HTC EVO 3D, save for its 4.5? screen and beefed up built-in memory - it packs a well familiar dual-core CPU, clocked at 1.2GHz and a Snapdragon S3 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do suspect that HTC has intentionally omitted features such as an HD screen and a beefed up CPU in order to maintain the flagship status of the Beats Audio sporting, HTC Rezound for Verizon Wireless. Thankfully, the Vivid is priced accordingly as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice above, the spec sheet of the HTC Vivid is mostly a familiar sight. HTC have grown the screen to put it in line with the rest of the LTE offerings from AT&amp;T.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not sure however, how the feeling of familiarity will bode for the smartphone ? it simply does not feel like a brand new product. It is the end of 2011 now ? a good eight months since HTC took the wraps off the similarly equipped Sensation 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to try and find out whether the HTC has what it takes to sway potential consumers away from the impressive Samsung and LG offerings. We are going to continue with unboxing, followed by design and build quality inspection on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The HTC Vivid is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A stripped-down retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the relatively big retail box of the HTC Vivid, you will find nothing but a microUSB cable and a charger, which are being kept company by a couple of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are willing to overlook the memory card omission (the HTC Vivid packs plenty of built-in storage), we can?t help but wonder for the reason why the headphones were omitted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid surely isn?t a design statement. The smartphone is certainly not the best looking offering we?ve seen from the Taiwanese company. It does however, look unmistakably like an HTC and we believe that this fact will appeal to plenty of people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the smartphone is solid. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the choice of materials. The HTC Vivid is predominantly dressed in glossy plastic. While we didn?t find any flaws in its quality, it proved to be a massive dust and fingerprint magnet ? that was especially the case with our black review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is highly unusual showing for HTC. We were always impressed by the materials and their implementation on the actual devices. Sadly, this is not the case with the HTC Vivid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the HTC Vivid are 128.8 x 67.1 x 11.2 mm, while its weight is the whopping 177 grams. The smartphone is certainly not the most pocket-friendly offering you will encounter ? even among the 4.5? Android devices. Once again however, this has never been an issue for the HTC loving crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is available in black and white color schemes ? a fact, which should help it appeal to a seriously wide audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.5? LCD screen of the HTC Vivid has the familiar qHD resolution. The display has the flaws of all its predecessors to date. Its viewing angles and outdoor legibility simply do not cut it in this price range. The unit is no match for the Galaxy S II?s Super AMOLED Plus unit or the award winning AH-IPS screen of the LG Nitro HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the typical four touch-sensitive buttons. Above the display is where the earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, the LED notification light, and front-facing camera unit can be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing but the microUSB port on the left side of the smartphone. On the right is where the volume rocker resides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack keep each other company on top of the HTC Vivid. There is nothing but a mouthpiece on the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC Vivid is covered by a great looking, matte black metal cover, which has tiny dots etched to it to give it texture. There, you will find the 8MP shooter with its LED flash, as well as the speaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the battery cover of the HTC Vivid. The SIM card and microSD card slots are not hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1620mAh battery of the HTC Vivid, despite appearing modest in capacity, achieved impressive overall score in our battery test. It needed a recharge every 42 hours when used for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out everything about the battery test of the HTC Vivid here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone handled well for its size. It is narrower than a Galaxy S II Skyrocket for example, so even single-handed operation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we came out fairly disappointed from both the design and the build quality of the HTC Vivid. We do not recall when the last time we had such feelings for an HTC made handset was ? they have always been among the benchmarks for high quality materials and solid feel. The glossy plastic of the Vivid however, is too much to handle. It collects dust and fingerprints, while looking seriously cheap - a really annoying combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software department of the HTC Vivid. There are less unpleasant surprises to be had here, as we?ve seen it on previous HTC smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread and HTC Sense 3.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid runs a familiar software combination. Android 2.3.4 and Sense 3.0 can be found on a number of HTC devices on the U.S. market including the Sensation 4G and EVO 3D, as well as the HTC Amaze 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the HTC Vivid in action. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We begin our tour of the user interface with the lockscreen. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone or drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s not the end of it - the HTC Vivid comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts, the time and the homescreen wallpaper. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget, which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes are all you get ? there?s no add or delete option ? it will come with Sense 3.5. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are seventeen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid features a Snapdragon S3 chipset with two 1.2GHz cores and a gig of RAM. We?ve tested several smartphones, featuring the above chipset, but with 1.5GHz dual-core CPUs, and came impressed by their benchmark scores. It appears however that the difference between 1.2 GHz and 1.5GHz can go a long way on the benchmark test track. The HTC Vivid performed in a rather unimpressive fashion. See for yourself below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same rule applies to the Vellamo browser benchmark. The extra oomph of the competition does better than the Vivid here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We all know by now that benchmarks are mostly reserved for bragging rights. Having this in mind, we found the HTC Vivid to be quite zippy and lag free when handling its daily tasks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual Sense-d phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivid has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs turn the HTC Vivid into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Vivid has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has options aplenty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Vivid is capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is covered by the on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 4.5? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit. In case this one doesn?t cut it for you, the Android Market is full of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. It is easy to set up and quite functional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not your plain vanilla Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does, but sans the 3D-ish effect. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo is straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also perform some basic picture editing actions within the gallery such as crop, apply effects, and rotate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Vivid supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A DivX enabled video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Vivid offers a full screen toggle (stretch/crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - 1080p MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled some 720p DivX or XviD videos. However, it was picky about which videos it would play and which it wouldn?t - especially when dealing with HD clips or large files. There's no MKV or subtitle support either, which was disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the device can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable. The Vivid needs some work in this department though, if we're to accept it as a proper portable HD video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense-ational music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, and Composers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Vivid" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls. That's not particularly useful but is good eye candy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an FM radio too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found no complaints with the audio output of the Vivid. It is on par with the best offerings currently on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A decent 8MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There?s a dual-LED flash / video light too. The camera unit has wide aperture lens for better low light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom lever on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can focus by touching the screen. Geotagging is on board as well. When focusing, the camera unit makes a sound, suggesting it is taking care of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the HTC Vivid loads fast ? you can access it straight from the lockscreen. The process takes less than a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid produces nicely detailed photos with faithful colors and low noise levels. We?re pretty pleased with the results ? they are on par with what the LG Nitro HD offers, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a number of camera samples. Check them out below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD camcorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one found in the still camera. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in 3gp, not the best quality container for a FullHD footage. We have prepared a couple of camera samples for you. Don't forget to click 1080p on the Full HD video sample and open the video full screen to really appreciate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're generally pleased with the video quality. The framerate is less than 30fps, but it hovers around 27fps so it's an acceptable deviation. The video is nice and crisp though the colors are somewhat on the dull side, but this could be just us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched 1080p video clip (14MB) too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has all you need and some more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid has a complete connectivity set. This department benefits the most from the presence of the Snapdragon S3 chipset. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icing on the connectivity cake is, of course, the LTE network compatibility. The speeds which we encountered with the HTC Vivid on AT&amp;T?s brand new 4G network often topped 50 MB/s for downloads ? faster than most people enjoy in their homes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer?s Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumb-friendly icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not over covering the connectivity - the "microUSB port" as we called it for convenience is actually a MHL port. If you plug a MHL dongle in it, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV - the qHD resolution has the perfect 16:9 aspect ratio for connecting to HDTVs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid has the latest Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread web browser, plenty of processing power and a large, high-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 720p played quite smoothly. 1080p however proves too much for the browser and the video gets choppy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A capable organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Vivid, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs. Oddly, you can edit existing Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone. You can't edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets either, which is a major stumbling block for doing Office document editing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Vivid into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the HTC flashlight app is missing from the Vivid. This should not be a problem though, as the Android Market is full of free options with the same functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps getting better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and a powerful GPU, the HTC Vivd can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.4 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also books, movies, music, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps will guide you through the unknown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America. It is still in Beta though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Vivid has full integration with HTCSense.com on board. We have covered it extensively in the past. You can take a look at it here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in April when we caught the first look of the HTC Sensation 4G, we were thrilled by its design and complete feature set. It was obvious that HTC had put a massive effort into developing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is December 2011 now and we?re talking HTC Vivid. The phone has practically the same specs and functionality, save for the bumps in the memory and screen departments, along with its LTE radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have raised the bar for themselves with their previous dual-core Android smartphones. The Vivid is nicely spec'd and it's also nicely priced although the materials that went in it are not as premium as we've come to see from HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the HTC Vivid sells for $99.99 with a two-year contract. If anything, the device is priced well for a dual-core Android smartphone, not to mention the LTE connectivity. Let?s take a quick look at its alternatives now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are an HTC fan, the Sensation 4G, Amaze 4G, or EVO 3D will all give you better value for your money unless you are into LTE specifically. All three devices will offer you a significantly better build quality and looks to go with the exact same functionality. The HTC Sensation 4G sells for $ 199.99, while the Amaze 4G and EVO 3D will set you back $239.99 and $99.99 respectively. You can always shop around at an authorized reseller and get a much better price than what the carriers are asking for them ? especially if you are signing a new contract.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you must have LTE on board, you can also take a look at the Verizon's HTC Rezound. The company?s flagship costs $299.99, but offers a killer retail package in addition to its HD screen and LTE flavor. You can also shop around for it and find a better price. Amazon Wireless for example, was selling it for a penny not so long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Rezound</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within AT&amp;T?s own LTE lineup, you will find the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket and LG Nitro HD as options. Both devices cost only $50 more than the HTC Vivid and offer superior hardware. The Skyrocket has the highly revered 4.5? Super AMOLED Plus screen, while the Nitro LG packs an award winning AH-IPS unit with HD resolution, designed with the purpose of besting the former. Both displays will blow HTC?s LCD unit out of the water.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There are plenty of other options and they all do not bode well for the fate of the HTC Vivid. It's obviously priced below the high-enders but its build quality is not as good as it should have been. And the cut-throat competition these days doesn't leave much room for compromise. It's still a quite capable droid with ample screen estate and a nice camera, so it's worth a shot if you are ok with its looks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In a rather surprising fashion, the HTC Vivid beat all the other members of AT&amp;T's LTE lineup by getting the highly coveted Android Ice Cream Sandwich update first. Naturally, the latest Android OS landed on the Vivid. The update is dressed with an updated Sense UI as well (from 3.0, to version 3.6).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the updated HTC Vivid in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice in the video above, with Android 4.0 ICS the HTC Vivid is even smoother performer now. Lag is practically nonexistent, while the transitions have become even more pleasant to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the fact that the OS is dressed in HTC Sense, you will feel immediately at ease with your device once you boot it after the update. Just in case, we took the liberty of highlighting some of the major changes, which the Sense-d Android ICS has brought to the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will begin with the device's homescreen. Gone is the arch at the bottom, which contained the buttons for the telephony, the application launcher, as well as the personalization menu. Instead, you will be treated to five docked icons. The middle one is the app launcher. The remaining four on its sides can be customized to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen panels can finally be discarded in Sense 3.6. As you probably remember, in HTC Sense 3.0 you were stuck with 7 homescreens regardless of the circumstances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neat Android 4.0 ICS feature, which allows you to create folders by simply dragging one icon over another, is on board as well, working like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Android 4.0 task manager is at your disposal too. The same goes for the data monitoring app, which is native to the OS now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The synthetic benchmarks have remained the same with one exception<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The OS update has made the entire software experience smoother, but the benchmark scores of the HTC Vivid have remained unchanged. Check them out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only major improvement we saw in the HTC Vivid benchmark results was the Vellamo score. Here, the smartphone posted the highest result we've seen in our tests yet. Here it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the web browser, it has gone through a massive renovation after the update. It is faster, more fluid and better in every aspect, compared to its predecessor. Incognito mode has been added as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI of the device has been changed as well. It has been taken straight out of HTC Sense 3.5, which we've seen in Android Gingerbread devices from the company. The same goes for the camcorder interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the video camera UI. It is even handier to use than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are some photos, taken with the HTC Vivid snapper after the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC music player has received the Beats Audio treatment. The only downside here, is that there are no other equalizer options on board - you will have to make do with Dr. Dre's take on the way your music should sound. A Beats wallpaper has been added as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a nutshell, the HTC Vivid has gotten much better after the update to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Its interface has managed to get faster and look better at the same time. The latest OS will make the HTC Vivid stand out in AT&amp;T's LTE lineup at least until the rest of it gets the update.</paragraph>
