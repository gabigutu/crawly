			<paragraph>LG KS360 is a mid-ranger that will easily catch your eye with bold colors and quirky controls. LG have managed to create a handset that's cunningly full of character, though it's kinda hard to think of it in the hands of a grown-up. It does seem like a toy at first glance and those color combos are to die for if you are of certain age and attitude.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet quite unexpectedly, LG KS360 is quick to serve a bunch of nice features such as a large and vivid 2.4-inch display, full QWERTY keyboard, a 2 megapixel snapper and? believe it or not? a wee tot of touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This midrange phone isn't exactly hard to keep your cool about and the flashy paintjobs don't help much either. But we were pleasantly surprised by the ergonomics and performance of the KS360. So while we gear up to put the LG KS360 through its paces, you better get yourself ready to be surprised too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 will be available in several color combinations, some of which will be exclusive to various carriers - the full list of color options includes Black and red, Black and silver, White and soft pink, and Titanium and bright blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The young and texting-savvy are two obvious targets of the slide-out QWERTY KS360. And while 18+ is not very likely, bill payers are given some sort of say with pay-as-you-go. The manufacturer is teaming up with operators such as Orange to offer the devices with the added value of free messages and free access to social community websites such as MySpace, Bebo, and FaceBook on Pay-as-you-go basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the handset can be found for around 80 GBP (140 US dollars or 99 euro) at Orange UK (the pink color version is one of their exclusive deals too). So if you are looking for a LG KS360, we guess your carrier's retail stores are the place to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unusual form factor puts the LG KS360 into a really narrow market segment currently cornered by the T-Mobile Sidekick family (the Sidekick Slide - a joint effort of Danger and Motorola - being the recent model at T-Mobile UK).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What both devices have in common are lively colors, QWERTY keypad and the young targeting, but with a decisive difference. T-Mobile is offering the Sidekick only on a Pay-monthly basis, while the KS360 is available on Pay-as-you-go. Additionally, the Sidekick Slide is way larger and heavier than the LG KS360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the KS360 probably has solid chances of market success for being adequately equipped and quite properly focused. It's also a nice performer, as you are about to find out. Join us after this very small jump as we explore the looks and feel of LG KS360.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the LG KS360<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 retail package has enough to get you going. A charger, a headset and a data cable is what you get. No memory card is pre-bundled here, but those are already ridiculously cheap so you can get one easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KS360 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 is a compact device with turn-head color combos. It's obviously targeted at the younger tween-and-teen audience. Measuring 101.5 x 51 x 16.8 mm the KS360 is definitely not a slim device, but it's still rather pocket-friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KS360 is notable for its rounded edges and the unusual round keys. The front panel is taken by the large 2.4" display of QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the handset is really affordable, cutting budget corners didn't seem to affect the screen. You may be surprised to know that it actually has touchscreen functionality, which is only available though with the phone dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of controls below the display, but even if the crammed layout of round knobs and flatbed keys may suggest otherwise, they are all easy to use with excellent tactility. The cross-haired navigation keys are notable for having the Up and Down keys and confirm center detached from the side scroll controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flatbed key under the left arrow is assigned to open the phone dialer - an on-screen num-pad that enables touchscreen dialing, as we already noted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slide out the drawer-like hardware QWERTY keyboard and the screen changes its orientation to landscape automatically. All the front controls under the display are duplicated on the QWERTY keyboard so you can not only type but also navigate the interface hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KS360 has an excellent QWERTY keypad with well spaced keys and excellent touch orientation. The only issue we had was the backlighting of the blue-colored KS360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main function symbols on each key have a blue backlight, while the secondary characters (numbers and punctuation) are backlit in bright orange. As a result the secondary ones are quite more prominent in a low light environment and may affect your typing speed as the main ones are a bit hard to recognize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other versions of the device, which have the same backlighting pattern but different color keyboards, don't have any of those issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot and the LG universal port for connecting charger, headphones and data cable are located on the left-hand side of the LG KS360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite side are the volume rocker and the shutter key. Now, given the sliding QWERTY keyboard, the left side of the device is actually the top side in landscape position. It just seems the shutter key location was chosen with left-handed users in mind. When shooting in landscape it's your left index finger that falls on the shutter knob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no controls at the bottom and top of LG KS360. You will find the battery release knob topside and the mouthpiece at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker and the camera lens are easily visible on the back of the device. The 2 megapixel snapper of the KS360 doesn't have a LED flash (not a big waste) and is only sided by a mirror for self-portraits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is a breeze. Under it is the 800 mAh Li-Ion battery. The LG KS360 is said to offer up to 5 h of talk time and up to 430 h of standby time. Those are above average figures, while the battery capacity doesn't seem to be above average. Unfortunately, we can't advise on the real-life battery performance of the KS360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we are impressed with the ergonomics of LG KS360. We should also point out the very good build: it's an all plastic piece of gear but neat and commendably sturdy. The handset handles nicely, the slider action is smooth and solid, and surfaces (except the screen) are fingerprint-proof. The handset is not thin at all, but remains compact, light and easy to handle. It's also got an excellent display - one of the best we've seen by LG, and all keys are tactile and friendly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fast-ticking user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KS360 features the regular LG user interface, which scores high on visual appeal and user-friendliness. The only issues we've had with it is the awkward behavior and silly limitations of the file browser that some LG models have. Yes, LG KS360 is among them. But more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of LG KS360 has information about the current time and date, as well as the typical status readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Orange have added a dedicated web shortcuts menu pegged to the left soft key. Although the icons look remarkably large, there's no touch functionality here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of LG KS360 is straightforward and makes sense most of the time. The different applications and settings are exactly where you would expect them to be, even if you don't have much experience with LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise was the fact that the LG KS360 can start up without a SIM card - that's rather unusual for LG mobiles. However, without a SIM card you won't be able to access the phone contacts list or any of the contacts options. You can't even add a new contact, when you start up the KS360 without a SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do have a SIM card in, but you want to turn all transceivers off, there is also a Flight mode available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you slide out the QWERTY keyboard, the interface orientation changes to landscape in an instant. The only confusing bit is that the context hints at the bottom of the display retain their relative position no matter portrait or landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In effect the OK context hint is always dead center at the bottom of the screen even in landscape mode, when the actual hardware OK key is way down the right corner of the QWERTY keyboard. It's no biggie but it's quite misleading and takes some getting used to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizing the KS360<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KS360 has several appearance customization options. There are two pre-installed themes - the regular dark LG one and a lighter colored Orange one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other customization options include altering the main menu, as well as font style and size for messages and dialing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in LG KS360 can store up to 1000 entries. The contacts stored on SIM and phone memory always display simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no option for contacts to be ordered by first or last name, as there's only one name field. That's kind of strange and might be inconvenient if you sync with a PC or another handset that has the usual first and last name fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user can opt for showing the caller ID images in the phonebook list along with the names. Searching is performed by gradual typing, but again if you have contacts with a first and a last name, it will only search the first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An irritating feature is that the first thing you see when you enter the Phonebook is the Phonebook options menu instead the actual contact list. The actual contacts only appear when you press Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum number of available contact info fields on the LG KS360 phonebook is 11, including 3 phone numbers. You can save a note, along with a personal photo and a ringtone, as well as one email address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG KS360 features the well-known grouping: contacts can be organized in groups for easier management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, the phonebook seems to offer enough for the mass user, however the lack of separate first/last name fields and the annoying two-click access to the contacts list can put off some of the potential users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 offers smooth and problem-free performance when it comes to the most essential element of a phone - making calls. It offers good reception and in-call sound, with pleasing voice quality on both ends of a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the treats of the LG KS360 is the touchscreen dialing - a dedicated key starts the dialer for you to tap in a number. Each press is marked by vibration feedback. The touchscreen functionality works only with fingers, so there's no need to fear accidental presses in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, LG KS360 does not sport Smart Dialing - a feature that automatically looks up contacts, whose numbers contain the digits you type in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put the KS360 to our traditional loudspeaker test and it scored an excellent mark. Here is how it ranks against some of the other handsets exposed to the same challenge. The KS360 is one of the loudest handsets we had tested. You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fancy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KS360 handles all of the most common type of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and email and even tops those with Bluetooth messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three message types share a common editor. There is a counter showing the number of symbols remaining to the limit of 160. When that limit has been exceeded, the editor turns another page, which should serve as an indication that the message will be sent in two chunks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to switch between different types of messages is insert some multimedia content - like a photo or an audio track for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that all messages share an editor on the LG KS360 has a somewhat negative impact on user-friendliness. Now all sorts of unneeded options pop in the way when you are trying to send a simple text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice feature of the messaging department introduced first by LG is the threaded messaging which not only shows your SMS in threaded balloons, but enhance those with the contact images of the senders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Threaded messaging on the LG KS360</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite easy to work with and mailboxes can be set up in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A certain drawback is the attachment limitation of the email client, which doesn't allow you to send full resolution 2 megapixel images taken with the LG KS360 camera as attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A second downer is the lack of SSL support. It makes using popular mail services such as Gmail impossible with the native email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, at least as far as Gmail is concerned, LG have pre-installed a Google package on the KS360 that gets you access not only to Google search, but also to Google Mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So generally, as far as common messaging needs are concerned, the KS360 is a decent performer - especially with the QWERTY keyboard, but the email management leaves much to be desired.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is poor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>File management in KS360 is as awkward, as with most LG phones out there. Each type of file content has its own designated folder. Files cannot be copied across folders as duplicate files on the phone memory (even in different folders) are obviously not allowed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create custom sub-folders but you still cannot copy content to them - you can only move files around - one by one or en masse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card contents are listed as an additional folder in the browser structure and if you don't use the default LG-created folders on the memory card you are bound for a lot of trouble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, to play music files straight from the file manager, you need to put them in the Sounds folder. The same goes for documents - as strange as it may sound - you cannot open an office document unless it's stored in the Documents folder, be it on the phone memory or the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of phone memory, the LG KS360 offers really inadequate amount of built-in storage memory - 15MB is not near enough even for a few multimedia files. We guess that puts a microSD memory card next on your shopping list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to memory cards, the LG KS360 supports the microSD variety with capacities of up to 4GB. We managed to confirm both that a 4GB card runs fine, as well as that larger cards (8GB) are not supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is extra spicy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of LG KS360 is both functional and user-friendly and is accessible through the My stuff icon in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the regular thumbnail view mode, LG KS360 offers a couple of new 3D animated view modes that we haven't seen on a LG phone before. They are pretty attractive but the animations tend to be just a wee bit too sluggish for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single pictures can be viewed in both landscape and portrait mode, and can also be displayed fullscreen. You can also zoom in to see further detail. Zooming is slow at the first zoom step, but then picks up. On the other hand, we are pleased with the panning speed and as well as with the overall speed of LG KS360 in general when handling multimedia. All those are typical LG perks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a second image gallery accessible only from the camera interface. It's really nice looking and offers a choice of larger thumbnails. Again, having two image galleries on board is typical LG.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poorly equipped music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on LG KS360 is rather basic - there is no way to sort tracks such as by artist, album or genre. There is a single basic skin and it doesn't seem to feature Album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, you can search for tracks and there are various equalizer presets. When managing your custom playlists you can make use of the automatic Recent and Favorites playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on LG KS360 with the FM radio too. Its interface is rather simple and generally very easy to work with. However the FM radio implementation has a number of drawbacks. There are only 12 slots for storing stations, there is no RDS support, and the radio cannot play in the background unlike the music player. All that makes you wonder what they were thinking, doesn't it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 has a nice video player. You can watch videos in landscape mode. Fast-forwarding and rewinding are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera gallery that we mentioned earlier also gives access to videos. The only difference with the regular file manager is the larger and nicer thumbnails. The video player functionality is just the same.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We don't mind the 2 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 has a regular 2 megapixel fixed focus camera. You can't be expecting much from it really, but it's nice to have it anyway. Plus it seems way better than the iPhone 3G camera for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is capable of producing images with a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. There is no LED flash, only a self-portrait mirror right next to the lens. Snapping and saving is extra fast, so shooting is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features include self timer, multi shot (3, 6, 9 images), white balance setting, some color effects (sepia, negative, black and white) and finally, exposure compensation. The shutter sound cannot be turned off, but that usually is a market-specific option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images produced by the camera turn out just fine for a 2 megapixel snapper. The contrast is nice, detail level is just as expected, there is no excessive noise and the color rendering is spot on. The only issue with the camera photos seems to be the wee bit of oversharpening, but that won't bother you if you don't intend to edit your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several camera samples produced by the LG KS360:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 is able to shoot video in QVGA resolution in 3GP video format. The frame rate is rather low (below 15fps) so we don't find that usable. We guess the video would be only good for MMS. That's why we won't be publishing a video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera user interface is the same as the one of the still camera and offers settings for video mode (general and MMS), white balance, color effects and exposure compensation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity on average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options are obviously not among the strongest points of LG KS360. It has tri-band GSM support only and you'd have to rely on GPRS and EDGE for wireless data transfers, as there is no UMTS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the LG KS360 packs stereo Bluetooth (A2DP) and USB support. The good news in the connectivity department is that - quite unusual for an LG phone - upon connecting it to a PC both the internal and external memory (card slot) are accessible as removable drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In pretty much every other LG handset, you only have access to the external memory when connected through USB and you need the LG PC Suite to access the internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser is a disappointment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a web-pitched handset, the LG KS360 web browser is remarkably disappointing. It loads pages slowly (compared to other EDGE phones), the rendering is bad (no desktop mode) and panning is painfully slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the web browsing is one of the places where you can really tell the LG KS360 is a lower midrange handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But of course, if you are not happy with the default browser, you can always take advantage of a third-party Java browser, like the excellent Opera Mini or Bolt browser for example. And by the way, you can easily install Java applications off the memory card as an alternative to accessing the installation files online through the browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer works impeccably<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of organizer capabilities, the LG KS360 seems capable enough .The calendar offers only monthly view mode and when putting down a new event, there's no event type choice - but that's ok by us. The event settings are also basic and include only date, time, alarm, subject, and repeat options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 also features an alarm clock application. It handles up to 5 different alarms, each with its own name, ringtone and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use either the Memo application or the Voice recorder to take notes on the go. The calculator, stopwatch and unit converter are well known applications that go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock application is a nice little helper that can tell you the current time in any time zone. In terms of layout and graphics it's really great and it also has an extremely large database of cities for each region and time zone. The only thing missing is a search option to make selecting a location easier but that's something we can live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 also offers an office document viewer courtesy of Access. The document viewer supports TXT, PDF, DOC, PPT, and XLS file support but it's performance is rather poor as it loads documents rather slowly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming letdown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KS360 comes with about four demo games - there's no full-featured game for you to enjoy in your spare time. But obviously LG had to cut some corners, after all the LG KS360 is pretty well equipped for its price point. Funnily, all games run in landscape mode only with no exceptions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, here you go, rounding off the LG KS360 review we've got to say that we are impressed by the tight package that this QWERTY slider offers. The impressive 2.4-inch display (with a spot of touchscreen here and there), the nice and comfy keyboard, and the responsive UI all combine into one capable feature phone. The attractive price point makes it even more sweet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are some drawbacks - but most of them are UI related and are dictated by the lower midrange platform of the device. The awkward file manager, the dummy FM radio and music player, and finally, the low end web browser are all stuff that we are used to see in LG phones in this market segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lively paintjobs will definitely be either a welcomed turn-on or a total turn-off. In either case, the LG KS360 represents a clear statement of either teen age or a youthful spirit.</paragraph>
