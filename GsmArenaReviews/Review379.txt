			<paragraph>It's been some time now that the Nokia 6270 has been on the market. This stylish slider is anything but slim and yet it managed to find its fans. The 2 megapixel camera along with the wide connectivity options, the large display and the great 3D stereo sound make it a prefered choice for a lot of? our guess is, die-hard Nokia fans. Our opinion is that there are better rival phones at the same price and functionality price range.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a long time Nokia made handsets with small CSTN color displays that were out of fashion. In a way, the manufacturer is a large gigantic dinosaur which needs a lot of time in order to turn to another direction. Now the giant has already turned its back on the old-fashioned displays and has started producing great bright TFT screens that easily catch anybody's eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same thing is happening now with the large size of the phones - almost all manufacturers have a slim series in their product line while Nokia is again slow to react to the change in trends and keeps manufacturing large, chunky handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we have in our hands another representative of the usual "massive" product line of Nokia which might not fit in everybody's pocket. The dimensions of the phone are 104 x 50 x 23 mm and it weighs 125 g without the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6270 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6270 is a large slider and easily reminds of Nokia 6280 which we already reviewed a while ago. Both sliders have a nice, masculine design. The 6280, however, has UMTS support with video calls, smaller dimensions and weight, and shoots VGA (640x480 pixels) resolution video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270's interface is identical to the interface used in several other recent Nokia phones - the user interface is the last generation of the Series 40 platform. That is why we are going to use several paragraphs from other reviews.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As regards the retail package, the box should include a stereo headset HS-23, a USB cable CA-53, and a 128MB miniSD card, but as we have always said - the contents of the retail package are market and country dependant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conservative all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slider features a rather conservative design with straight lines and angles all over. The phone has anodized aluminum surface al over although it doesn't feel metallic at all. The sliding mechanism boasts a rather strong spring which opens the phone to full extent with minimal effort from the thumb. The shiny metallic insert (like the one on Nokia N80) between the front and the back panel and the similar one surrounding the display actually provide a lot for the general expensive looks of the phone. Although large and bulky, it still looks as a finely crafted piece of technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6270 opened: front, back, top and bottom view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the front panel incorporates only the central navigation D-pad along with two soft keys and green and red receiver keys. When the slider is opened, the large numeric keypad is revealed. The keys are unusually large, well spaced and the central column of keys is separated from the rest by a thin metallic insert - much like the Nokia 6280 slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad itself is great for typing - the keys have a very good response and even for a first-time user it allows great typing speed. A great thing is that you can do almost anything with the phone (even talk) without having to open it. If you still need to open it, closing it back down would make the phone prompt you shortly to lock the keypad. In that case the key lock is activated through the central OK key of the D-pad. But once the phone is fully opened, locking the keypad is done the usual way by pressing menu plus asterisk on the keypad or using the Switch Off/Profiles button and the famous context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6270 closed ? Nokia 6270 keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features only the Push-to-Talk shortcut key and the memory card slot cover. Now Nokia should really do something about that fixed PTT key since the Push-To-Talk service is not available in all countries. The Nokia people should really make that user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6270 left side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side incorporates the swing volume button and the camera shortcut keys. The Voice Dial and Voice Commands are entered after a longer press of the DOWN volume key. On both sides of the phone you can easily see the apertures for the stereo speakers - we must admit that they really make a difference to the sound quality. Once Stereo widening is turned on, the stereo effect of the sound of the phone is truly remarkable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6270 right side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone around we see the camera lens cover surrounded by classy, shiny silvery frame. When looking at the back panel horizontally, the lash LED is positioned above the lens cover - much like it's done on an ordinary digital camera. The wonderfully designed back side of the phone can be easily mistaken for a real digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is removed with a slide. The battery used here is the Li-Ion Nokia BL-5C with a capacity of 970 mAh. According to the manufacturer, the battery should provide up to 2.5-5 hours of talk time and up to 160-240 hours of stand-by time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn't test the phone's battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced has not indicated the real-life performance of the phone. The SIM card bed has a hinged cover which holds the card in place. We must admit that it's a very comfortable solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6270 lens cover ? Battery cover removed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is white and subtle, but strong enough. The phone has a wonderful 2.2" 262K color TFT display with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. The vivid screen is perfectly legible even under direct sunlight and has a wide viewing angle from all sides - Nokia deserve compliments for the great job.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's a phone after all?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Incoming calls are accepted by sliding out the handset or by pressing the green receiver key. You can even talk on the slider without it being open. Calls are terminated either by pressing the red receiver or by closing the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During our test the phone behaved very well. The sound during calls is remarkably good and deserves compliments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound of the integrated stereo loudspeakers is brilliant and loud enough. Bass elements are clearly recognizable. We didn't hear virtually any distortion during our tests. The stereo effect adds a depth to the overall sound of the phone and it really sounds great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vibration strength is on an average level but does its job in alerting you of an event if the phone is in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good thing is that you can switch the Nokia 6270 on without having to insert a SIM card. If you do so, you will be able to use all functions that don't require the presence of a SIM card, like the MP3 player, for example. It works like an Airplane mode which is present in other phones, but the inconvenience here is that you have to remove the SIM card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest S40 user interface is a great choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard standby screen shows the signal strength, the battery capacity, the date and the clock (digital or analogue), the carrier name, and the active profile (if different from Normal). The two soft keys can be assigned a function according to the user preference. A wise choice would be to assign the Go To menu to one of the keys - this menu includes frequently used functions and is totally user configurable. The four ways of the navigation D-pad can also be assigned some functions. You may also want to place a cross with the icons of the assigned functions in the middle of the display - at least in the beginning while you remember them. The interface can be customized through graphic themes but they really don't change much - the only things that they change are the wallpaper, the menu background and the color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby screen ? List of themes: Zen theme applied</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant fact is that you can choose the colors of the text on the standby screen from a wide array of available colors. Unfortunately, changing the font color is not available throughout the whole menu and when using some graphic themes legibility is not perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting option regarding the standby screen is the Active stand-by mode, where all favorite applications' icons, music functions, upcoming events from the calendar, and notes appear on the display - much like the one seen on Symbian phones with the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface. When you have the Active stand-by mode switched on, pressing UP on the D-pad gives you access to the icon bar and your favorite functions such as the MP3 player, the FM radio or the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The active standby screen (inactive) ? the active standby screen (active)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu features a fixed set of items but they can be freely organized in four different ways: as a list, as a 3 x 4 grid matrix, as a 3 x 3 grid matrix with labels, and as horizontal tabs. The second option, a plain table without legends, permits the visualization of 12 icons en bloc and is probably the most space-saving one. Icons can be additionally reordered according to the user's preference. The icons themselves are well elaborated except that their graphics suffer a hard case of jagged outlines. It must be noted that they resemble a lot of the icons used in the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size is again subject of configuration. Inside the phonebook there are two font options, while in the message application and the Internet browser you can choose out of three. The largest font is truly large; on the other hand the smallest one permits you to see an entire SMS en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Nokia 6270 allows a great deal of user-configurable options and the interface may be greatly suited to the user's own taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ringing profiles include settings such as type of incoming call alert, ringtone, ringing volume and vibration alert, sounds serving Push-to-talk, messages, notifications and warning tones and the keypad sounds. A great thing about the profiles is that they offer timed expiration so you won't forget to turn the sounds of your phone back on after that all-important meeting. You can even set a profile to be turned automatically on once plug in an accessory as the charger, for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook manages to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 offers 1000 contact positions but if you store more than 1 number per contact the total capacity would decrease. As usual with any Nokia's phonebook, it can be organized in three different views: as a standard list, as a list of names with numbers, or as a list of names with pictures. Searching is performed by gradually typing the first letters of the respective name. The phonebook can be ordered and searched either by first or last name. You can choose a default contact list - the one on the SIM card, the one in the phone's memory or both simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phonebook: Name list &amp; Name list with numbers ? Searching the contacts list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details can include five types of phone numbers, addresses, notes, a picture, a ringtone, etc. We miss the option for entering the contact's birthday, which could be transferred directly to the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Contact details fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer not to customize each individual contact, you could organize some contacts into groups and assign ringtones and pictures to the individual groups. When setting the ringing profiles you can select which groups will be able to reach you on the phone - in this way the groups serve as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can freely use the voice dial feature of Nokia 6270 for all the contacts since it needs no voice tag recording. If the required contact has more than one number, Nokia 6270 uses the default one (mobile number, ground line, office number...). It is quite a pity that the number type cannot be selected with an additional voice order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is that besides Voice dial, you can use the Voice commands option which is again speaker independent and can be used for voice control of a certain set of the phone's function.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Missing something?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of missed calls appears in a window on the main display. From here you can get to the corresponding log, where calls from the same number are grouped in one item accompanied by the date and the time of the last executed call. The same principle is applied for dialed and received calls as well. Each folder can fit in up to 20 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dialled numbers list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that is not everything. Nokia 6270 also offers a cumulative Calls Log, in which all call types, including multiple tries are organized in chronological order. You will also find a list of the recent Message recipients, as well as a counter for all sent and received messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Various messaging options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 works with SMS, MMS, emails, and Push-to-talk. In addition, it offers two special types: sound MMS and instant SMS, which appear directly on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message, first you are offered the opportunity to enter the recipient's number and then you can start typing your message on a single line which get extended further down to the whole display as the message gets longer. Messages are sent in the background which is really nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Typing a SMS message ? Starting a new email message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When asked to type the recipient, you may type their phone number straight away, select it from the phonebook, browse groups, or look it up into the list of people, to whom you have recently sent a SMS. The last option is particularly useful as people tend to write messages frequently to a limited group of contacts, which is in this case directly accessible. The editor counts down written characters and informs about the number of messages that will be sent. T9 dictionary is also there to assist you and offers an extensive vocabulary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications about SMS delivery can be activated both individually for separate messages and generally for all outgoing ones. They appear on the display for a while and then get saved into the phone memory. The Delivery reports are stored in a dedicated folder which makes their deleting quite easy when their time has come. Nokia 6270 features a new version of the MMS editor, which shows you the exact content of the message that the recipient is going to receive. So, making previews as in older Series 40 Nokia models is no more necessary. MMS can contain text, a picture, a sound clip, a video record, a business card, and a note from the calendar. Multiple-page MMS are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in Nokia 6270 is a java application and thus takes longer to start. It is generally slower and it is not perfectly compatible with the rest of the applications in the phone. Nevertheless, the email client cannot be considered bad. It has POP3 and IMAP4 support. The email client copies email addresses from the phonebook and works with attachments. At the same time messages cannot be sent from the email field in the phonebook. This option is available for SMS and MMS only. Automatic download of email message is not available either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music in your ears<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though music files can be directly played either from the memory, or from the memory card (respective folder is selected in the music player application), it is more convenient to transfer music into the phone using the Nokia Audio Manager, which is a part of the PC Suite. Here you can create playlists and transfer music straight into the mobile device through a USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 or AAC player integrated in Nokia 6270 is rather simple. The available controls are start/stop, fast forward, rewind, previous track and next track. If you minimize the player, the name of the currently running track appears on the active stand-by display. From active stand-by you can even choose to play the next track or fast forward or rewind the current without opening the player back. Repeating and shuffle options are available, too. The player allows listening music on a Bluetooth headset. Some sources of information on the Internet claim that the phone supports the A2DP profile for listening music on stereo Bluetooth headset, but currently Nokia 8800 is officially the only mobile phone of the Swedish manufacturer to support that Bluetooth profile. Having said that, connecting a stereo Bluetooth headset to the phone is indeed possible, but the sound is far from perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Music Player: main interface &amp; playing in the background on the active standby screen </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video in Nokia 6270 is played within an application called Media Player, which also supports streaming and can also open pictures and play individual music files. Unfortunately, the Media Player is not capable of fast forwarding videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music/media player, switch on the FM radio. Here you can save up to 20 broadcasting stations. In general, however, it does not offer any special functions, not to mention RDS. The radio can be turned on only when the headset is plugged in since its cable serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The FM radio: storing a station &amp; playing in the background on the active standby screen </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Managing your multimedia files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager is on a very good functional level. You can create folders, mark several or all files and then move them. A certain drawback is that you can't mark several files and then mass send them. You can sort the file list either by name, by date, by format, or by size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the picture files list either as a list with small thumbnails, as a list with details and larger thumbnails, or as a 4 x 3 grid matrix which offers the largest thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves in normal mode or in fullscreen horizontal mode and move through the files with the help of the D-pad at a pace of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Thumbnails with details ? Viewing a picture in normal mode ? Viewing a picture in horizontal mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows you to zoom in the pictures to their original size or set their contrast. You can even print the images through direct USB connection. There is even a simple image editor which allows for basic functions such as inserting text, frame, clip art or another image to an already existing one. You can also crop the existing image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A rather disappointing camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with a LED flash. The maximum resolution is 1600 x 1280 pixels. Lower resolution as well as three types of compression quality is available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone takes pictures in horizontal mode using the camera right side button as a shutter release key or the central OK button of the D-pad. Strangely enough, some of the menus are operated in vertical mode. The camera is rather slow and a shot at the maximum quality and resolution takes about 9-10 seconds from pressing the shutter key to actually saving the picture. At the 1280 x 960 pixels resolution (1.3 megapixel) the same operation takes about 8 seconds to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 offers a night mode, a self-release timer, and an image sequence shoot mode. White balance is automatic. A good thing is the option to turn off the camera shutter sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera interface: viewfinder and camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, as far as the picture quality is concerned, the best we can say is that it's about average. We've seen far better 2 megapixel cameras in mobile phones. The image colors are quite unnatural and the pictures are overprocessed by some noise reduction algorithm, which applies water color effect to the objects located far away from the camera - and furthermore they are seriously out of focus. Generally speaking the camera has serious issues (at least in our unit). There is no autofocus of course; there isn't even a dedicated macro mode. The result is that pictures taken from less than around 80 cm are out of focus. What's worse is that objects that are more than 3 to 5 meter from the camera seem almost out of focus. Faces of people shot from around a 10 m distance are unrecognizable. Furthermore, all interior pictures suffer from strong color blotches despite the abundant light both from natural and artificial sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>                Nokia 6270 sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured at the only available QCIF (176 x 144 pixels) resolution. The quality of Nokia 6270 video is average and the available resolution is rather outdated these days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wide connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 has a quad-band GSM support (850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz) plus GPRS Class 10 and EDGE Class 10 for fast data transfers and streaming 3gpp content. The phone has a XHTML browser with WAP 2.0 support. The browser is simple, with three types of font size available. That said, we must point out that it deals alright with general HTML sites and has no problem in fitting them on the screen. Unfortunately, you cannot use the browser in a horizontal mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6270 web browser: GSMArena.com, Audi.com, Nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 can also serve as a modem for establishing Internet connection from PC. The phone gets connected to a PC through Bluetooth, via the Infrared port, or by USB cable. Connection parameters can be configured manually, but you will save time if you use the Internet connection program from PC Suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has an Infrared port and Bluetooth connectivity for close communication with other devices. The phone supports the following Bluetooth profiles: Bluetooth Dial-Up Networking, Bluetooth Serial Port, Bluetooth File Transfer, and Bluetooth ObjectPush.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Don't wanna miss a thing?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6270 has a separate Organizer menu which includes applications to help you stay on schedule. The Alarm clock allows for only one alarm to be set but it can be repeated on given days of the week. Nokia 6270 will wake you up with a standard peep sound, with any sound saved in the phone, or with radio signal, if the earphones are plugged in. The snooze time of the alarm is also configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar application has benefited significantly from the large display and its higher resolution. The monthly view includes details like the weeks and the week days, while the Weekly view includes details like the days and the hourly schedule for those days. The week begins according to the wish of the user - in Saturday, Sunday or Monday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers 5 types of events: meeting, call, birth date, memo, and reminder. The last one, the reminder, is used for fast inserting something that has to be reminded of soon. In other mobiles you often need to use the "meeting" option as a reminder, which unnecessarily complicates things. The reminder in Nokia 6270 includes the following details: subject, place, starting date and time, end date and time, reminder date and time, reminder type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly, and annually). The phone offers synchronization of notes and calendar events with both a PC and a remote server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Organizer menu ? setting an alarm ? Calendar: monthly view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list is simple enough. Here you can only add a subject, a priority, a term, and a reminder type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. List items can be ordered in alphabetic order or by deadline. Tasks are very easy to transfer into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are quite handy, because they get synchronized with PC, which allows for longer texts to be downloaded into the phone. Font size is not configurable. Yet, in my opinion it is the text notes where three font size options would have been really helpful (just like in the SMS application).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 offers a voice recorder and as in Nokia 6280, the voice record duration depends on the available free memory only. It's up to your will whether the recordings will be stored into the internal memory or onto the memory card. Nokia 6270 uses the .amr format and a one-minute recording uses approximately 100 KB of the memory. Here the Nokia engineers could have designed the side button on the left side of the phone to start the voice record instead the Push-to-talk function or at least it should have been made user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu also has a countdown timer and a stopwatch. The Java applications include a unit &amp; currency converter, a world time clock, and a calculator. The latter is quite detailed, offering not only standard mathematic operations, but also work with powers, square roots, reciprocals, functions, the number pi, and memory functions. Yet, the calculator ignores common operator priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things we missed is an application for viewing MS Office and Adobe Acrobat PDF files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing in 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6270 supports Java 2.0. The phone features 2 pre-installed games: Golf Tour and Snake III. Both feature interesting graphics, but disappoint when it comes to amusement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Golf Tour &amp; Snake III games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Golf game is as realistic as possible on such a small display and the limited control options. There are several available types of gameplay so you shouldn't get bored easily. The Snake game is a nicely elaborated 3D variant of the legendary Snake game. But this time the controls are rather complicated and you can hardly get the apple you are after since the snake doesn't turn in the right moment you want it to turn.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the very beginning we were pretty reserved towards Nokia 6270. During the tests, however, it turned out that it offers abundant user-configurable options to make your life easier. The menu is organized logically; functions are detailed, offering high control comfort and brilliant work efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When making an informed buying decision though, competition does matter - if you make your research you will find that there are a lot of other phones that offer equal functionality with a far better design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia's greatest drawbacks - the size and weight, the lack of playlists support for the music player, the low camera picture quality and the hefty price would surely make a lot of people turn their backs to it.</paragraph>
