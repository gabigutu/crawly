		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You wouldn't call Sony's first foray in tablets a sweeping success. Last year the company released its first two droid slates and, while they were both eccentric enough to get everyone's attention, none of them was really fit to survive in a crowded and highly competitive market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems though that Sony are quick learners. The Xperia Tablet S has kept the catchy folded magazine design, and lost fat around the waist while enjoying a processing power boost, that should let it catch up with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no 1080p screen or Jelly Bean here, but Tegra 3, a BRAVIA-powered WXGA and Ice Cream sandwich still give the Sony Xperia Tablet S good fighting chances in its price range. The metal design should help get the attention of those tired of plastic devices, and there are some nice home-baked software tweaks such as guest mode and remote app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The splash-resistance of the Xperia Tablet S is a nice touch as well, although given the most recent turn of events it probably won't be as much of a selling point. Still, Sony has produced a well-equipped tablet that should offer snappy performance, the unmatched versatility of Android and cool looks. Now who wouldn't want some of that?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still need to take a closer look and see how the cool sounding specs translate into real-life performance. As usual we'll start with the hardware right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S measures 239.8 x 174.4 x 8.8 mm, which makes it notably more compact than its closest rivals in terms of specs and price - the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T (263 x 180.8 x 9.9mm) and the Acer Iconia Tab A510 (259.1 x 175.3 x 10.2 mm). At 570g it's also way easier to carry and operate without support for your hands than the other two (the Asus slate weighs 635g, while the Acer tips the scales at 680g).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there are two things to consider here - the Sony Xperia Tablet S BRAVIA screen is of the rather unorthodox size of 9.4", as opposed the 10.1" LCD on the other two. The 15% difference in screen estate doesn't put the Xperia Tablet S in a new category, but is still big enough to be evident in everyday usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the folded magazine design brings the thickness of the tablet at the top end to 11.9mm. This one is actually much less of an issue as the tablet is as slim as promised for the lower two-thirds of its body and that's where your hands sit most of the time anyway. The extra depth makes the tablet top-heavy though, which is something to consider. On the other hand, the folded bit provides excellent grip in portrait orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we think the Sony Xperia Tablet S easier to wield and carry than just about every 10" tablet, but still not light enough to be considered much more than a couch device. Prolonged use is guaranteed to tire your hands and you'll be looking for a place to rest against in a matter of minutes, despite the lowered weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the design - Sony like to joke that the folded-magazine styling is lawsuit-proof. We've heard that one on at least two separate occasions and it's one of those things that don't usually sound as good the second time around. The last thing you would want anyway is have lawyers tell the designers what to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be clear, we don't think this was the case here. Sony just likes to point out that their R&amp;D department came up with something that looks vastly different from anything on the market and yet still works. Okay, maybe not vastly different, after all there's only so many ways to do a glass front panel with a huge screen in the middle, but the back is instantly recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while making an impression is one thing, making a good impression is a whole other story. Luckily Sony has nailed that one too and we quite like the Sony Xperia Tablet S. The folded bit at the back even enables easier (and more secure) attaching of carrying cases like the official cover that Sony sells as an optional accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only part of the design we are not too sure about is the fact that the folded piece is made of black textured plastic, while the rest of the back panel is smooth aluminum and the two don't go too well together. We are not saying it's bad, but there's certainly room for improvement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Sony Xperia Tablet S is dominated by the 9.4" BRAVIA-powered display of WXGA resolution. The screen tends to be pretty reflective, which leads to rather poor sunlight legibility, but has pretty good image quality indoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast and colors are good and the screen is reasonably sharp. It doesn't come anywhere close to the 1080p screens out there and the iPad 3 Retina, but it's doing fairly well for within the WXGA category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were also able to put the display under our digital microscope for a closer look at the pixels. Check it out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1MP front-facing camera is located in the center above the display, when you hold the tablet in landscape mode. Alongside it is the ambient light sensor, which enables automatic screen adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/screen lock button is located on the right side of the Sony Xperia Tablet S, next to the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the other end we find the SD card slot, which is hidden under a small plastic flap and the 3.5mm audio jack. You read that right - the Sony Xperia Tablet S features a full size SD slot, rather than one of the microSD variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On one hand this allows for even cheaper memory expansion, but on the other hand this means that you can't simply insert the microSD card from your smartphone in your tablet. You can simply have an adapter pre-inserted in the slot to solve this issue, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fold of the Xperia Tablet S on top is deprived of any functional elements, while at the bottom you get the stereo speakers and the Sony proprietary connector. Yet another proprietary connector is hardly great news and we really hope Android manufacturers will finally follow Google's lead with the Nexus 7 and start putting microUSB ports on their tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our hardware tour at the back, where we find the 8 megapixel camera lens. There's no flash here, so don't expect to get any kind of usable shots in low-light conditions, but since tablets (let alone 10-inchers) are by far not the most comfortable devices for taking photos we won't be deducing any points here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the metal back panel sits a 6000 mAh battery, which Sony says is capable of lasting for up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. The number sounds quite good, but since we didn't get to spend enough time with the slate we are unable to confirm if it's achievable in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's now time we move on the Sony Xperia Tablet S user interface. Sony has backed in some interesting tricks in the Android 4.0 ICS interface and we'll not get to see if those work as advertised.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface for multiple users<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S launched with Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich and Sony has kept it fairly free of modifications. They have added some potentially very useful features like Guest mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on, here's a short video walkthrough of some of the more interesting features of Sony's new tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a pretty standard ICS affair. It shows the time, notifications and date along with a drag-to-unlock circle. When you touch the circle two options appear - just unlock or unlock and start the camera. The notification area can be accessed from the lockscreen, so you can, for example, dismiss a notification or toggle Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen can fool you for a second that you're looking at stock ICS, but then you start spotting differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the same row, on the right is the clock and status bar as usual. You can tap it to bring up a bigger clock along with a list of all notifications. Another tap expands it and gives you access to an Airplane mode, Auto-rotate screen and Notification toggles and shortcuts to the Wi-Fi and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two buttons in the center of this row are new and activate two Sony-made enhancements. The one on the left displays a list of Small apps - floating apps that take up only a part of the screen and can be used alongside regular apps. The other button launches the Remote control app, which itself is a Small app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Small apps are Browser, Calculator, Clip, Memo, Recorder, Remote control and Timer. Each app can be dragged around the screen if you need to get it out of the way and some of them, like the Browser can be resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Small apps can be pretty useful and enhance the multitasking skills of the Xperia Tablet S. For example, if you're writing something you can use the floating browser as reference material. You can also tap on the expand button if you want to go to the full-screen browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to download and install new Small apps off the Play Store but there aren't any yet. Not a big deal though because each and every widget can be made into a small app, so you can make a Small app that controls the music player in just a couple of clicks by adding the music player widget to the list. Shortcuts to Small apps can be added to the homescreen just like regular app shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get back to the Remote control app later, in the Connectivity section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another Sony change is on the top row of the screen, right next to the always visible Google text and voice search shortcuts. It's a small dock of four shortcuts that you can replace with any four of choice. They are visible on all five homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top row has another extra - the Guest mode button. The tablet lets you create multiple "modes", which is similar to having multiple user accounts on your computer. Each mode can be restricted to access only some apps and widgets or it can be allowed to access everything. You can password protect modes to prevent moving from a restricted mode to one with more access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each mode has its own arrangement of the five homescreens, which really expands the use cases for this feature. You can use it as a sort of child lock for example. Or you could use it as a Work/Home mode switcher by arranging different widgets on the homescreens for each of the two modes while allowing full access to all apps and widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that keeps this Guest Mode option from being a true multi-user feature is that all users share all the files. You can sort of get around that by disabling the file browser apps and the Play Store, but as a general rule Guest Mode won't help you keep some files private. Still, it's a feature that no other tablet has out of the box, even HTC's Scenes are not as powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to the homescreens. There's nothing that has really changed here - you get 5 homescreens (you can't add or delete or even rearrange homescreens), you can place shortcuts, folders and widgets here and some widgets are resizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One change that Sony made is a fast scrolling option. When you pan slowly, five rectangles show up at the top of the screen with another one indicating the currently active homescreen. Once that happens, only a small movement is required to scroll through the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is standard ICS - it houses both apps and widgets, which are sorted into two tabs. You get a shortcut to the Google Play Store and an option to sort apps and widgets alphabetically or by installation date (newest first).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran practically every benchmark we could think of, testing the CPU (four Cortex-A9 cores at 1.3GHz in the Tablet S), the GPU (an ULP GeForce) and the web browser (stock browser on Android ICS and Chrome).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi is good at estimating per-core performance and the Xperia Tablet S does very well here. It comes second only to the higher-clocked Samsung Galaxy Note II, but beats the Tegra 3-packing Nexus 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is better at multi-tasking performance. Here, the Tablet S maintains its lead on the Nexus 7, but falls behind the Exynos-powered Galaxies (whose CPUs are clocked higher). Geekbench 2 concurs with these findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu shows that the performance of the Sony tablet is comparable to a Tegra 3 phone. Quadrant puts it a bit behind, but the tablet is at a bit of a disadvantage due to its higher screen resolution (1280 x 800 vs. 1280 x 720).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to look at the ULP GeForce performance. NenaMark 2 doesn?t really give us any significant result beyond that the PowerVR SGX540 that's inside the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is getting too old to be in a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offscreen Egypt GLBenchmark tests were used to put the GPUs on equal footing. The SGX543MP4 inside the new iPad normally renders graphics at a much higher resolution than even 1080p, so it's far ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, the Sony Xperia Tablet S comes out last in this test, even behind the Nexus 7, which has the same GPU.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the browser. For SunSpider and BrowserMark we used the default browsers on each tablet. Samsung has done a great job of optimizing the browser on Exynos (less so on TI OMAP), but the Xperia Tablet S actually edges out Apple's latest tablet, which is no small achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo puts it behind all the quad-core phones we've tested though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, FishIE Tank shows good HTML5 canvas performance, though it doesn?t beat the quad-core phones. As far as HTML5 compatibility goes, if you're running Chrome on the Tablet S, you'd be on par with the current flagship phones, except the Galaxy S III, which has an advantage.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the Xperia Tablet S doesn?t break far from the pack and does about as well as most other Tegra 3 tablets, Sony has done a relatively good job at providing a well-performing package. The GPU scores could have been a bit better, but the rest is good (and will only get better once the Tablet S gets the Jelly Bean update).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Split-screen contact book<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the Sony Xperia Tablet S doesn't have telephony, the People app is still quite useful. It's organized into three tabs - Groups, All (the default one) and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed alphabetically with an image next to the name and an alphabet scroll to make finding a contact quicker (there's also regular search as you type).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses a split screen interface, so that you can pick a contact from the list on the left and view its details on the right. You can add multiple accounts (Google and Skype by default) and filter which ones are visible in the contact list to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple fields of different types to store more info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Favorites tab shows only starred contacts and uses a rectangular grid of their contact images. The images are big and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Xperia Tablet S doesn't have telephony features, we still tested the loudspeaker performance as it will be used for music and videos. It scored a Below average, which isn't very impressive. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email, chat and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with two email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic one to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single message, the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be sorted by sender, subject or date. Bulk actions are supported, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and only check your mail manually. There's also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's basically the same treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with three chat apps out of the box. The first two are pretty much mandatory for an Android device, Gtalk and Google Plus Messenger, but there's also Skype pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Skype is the same app as on phones, so its UI doesn't really make a good use of the tablet's big screen. Still, with a 720p-capable front-facing camera, the Tablet S can be more comfortable to use for Skype video calls than a laptop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text input, the tablet relies on a custom keyboard. Most of the time it only displays letters, but on occasion (e.g. when entering a password), a numpad will appear on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like, you can set the numpad to be always on, the screen is big enough to fit both letters and numbers. We quite like the arrangement and we think it works better than putting the numbers on the top row (which wastes too much vertical space).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, typing on such a big on-screen keyboard is far from the most comfortable experience in the world. In landscape orientation, your hands have to hover and the tablet is a bit too wide to type comfortably while holding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're used to typing on a tablet you might be okay though. Plus, things improve a bit when you put the Xperia Tablet S on a cover, tilted at a shallow angle. You still might want to look into the Surface-like keyboard/cover combo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two galleries, both good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with two gallery apps - one is a standard-looking Android gallery (with quite a few modifications actually) while the other is called Album, which is the tablet version of Sony's custom gallery app that we saw on the Xperia acro S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the well-known Android gallery. It finds all images on the tablet's internal memory and also loads any Picasa albums you might have. Those can be made available for offline viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos are grouped by folder into a rectangular grid of thumbnails. You also have the option to group the images by date, location or tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single image, you get options to edit or crop an image or start a slide show. Overlaid on the bottom of the screen is a strip of tiny thumbnails that can be used to jump to other images in the same folder (or whatever the images were grouped by).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option here is to tap a button in the top right corner of the screen, which splits the screen in two. The image is in the top part of the screen, while the strip of thumbnails is moved to the bottom. You can adjust the splitting line, giving more room to the big image or to the grid of thumbnails (they animate from a single row to a grid as you move the line up). A map view is also available in this mode, with an option to pick between standard maps or satellite imagery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Album app, images are arranged into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date, but you can also opt for displaying all of your albums in one place. There are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab - you can use pinch gestures to make the thumbnails bigger or smaller. The map tab opens a full-screen map with all the geotagged images scattered around the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab uses pictures from the connected Picasa or Facebook. You can post comments on photos from both and also like photos coming from Facebook. This tab will also scan the Wi-Fi network so you can browse photos shared from your computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player with plenty of enhancements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S uses a Walkman-branded music player app. The interface is dead simple - you get album art on the left/top (in landscape/portrait orientation) that you can swipe to move between songs and playback controls on the right/below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Songs can be starred to mark as favorite in your music library and you can also "like" a song and post about it on Facebook. You can also replace the album art with a visualizer - you can pick from 7 themes or let it pick one at random.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has two tabs - Playing and My Music. The first tab holds the now playing interface, wile the other browses your local music library along with DLNA-compatible music sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical for Sony music apps, the Infinite button lets you look up song lyrics on Google, the artist in Wikipedia and search for the music video (both regular and karaoke) on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Tablet S features stereo speakers on its bottom, which you have to be careful not to muffle (especially if you're using a cover as a stand). They sound pretty good actually for tablet speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of sound enhancing technologies. The first is ClearAudio+, which attempts to restore what was lost in the MP3 compression. Clear Phase in turn "automatically adjusts the sound quality of the internal speaker". You also get xLOUD and you can turn on S-Force Front Surround 3D to emulate 3D sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there's an equalizer as well, with a number of presets along with manual controls. You can save two user defined presets. There are five frequency bands to be adjusted, plus Clear Bass.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player could use better codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with a dedicated Movies app, which can be used to watch video, but you can also use the gallery to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Movies does have some advantages though. For one, it's dedicated UI is easier to use and shows both local videos and ones shared over DLNA. It can also connect to Blu-ray recording devices and stream from them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Movies app offers some of the same audio enhancements as the music player. There's Clear Phase, xLOUD and S-Force Front Surround 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as codec support goes, we've seen better. The Xperia Tablet S had little problem playing HD videos in MP4 and MKV format, including 1080p videos. DivX and XviD videos seemed to be a problem though as we only managed to get SD videos with these codecs going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is another issue - there's no support for AC3 or DTS, which are commonly found in MKV videos. Subtitle support is missing too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is clean, but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S did decently well in our audio quality test, but its volume levels failed to impress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Sony slate was quieter than average even for a smartphone, but all of its readings turned out excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connecting a pair of headphones leads to a spike in stereo crosstalk and a slight increase in intermodulation distortion. Neither of these is too alarming, but we got below average volume levels again, which prevented us from giving the Xperia Tablet S a perfect score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the results for yourself for in the table below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera doesn't impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S packs an 8MP main camera that can capture photos with a maximum resolution of 3248 x 2432 and a 1MP front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has decided to slap on a custom camera interface and while we like the features, the UI is irritating. The viewfinder takes only a small part of the screen (especially in 8MP, 4:3 mode), while the rest of the 9.4" screen is wasted on buttons and a strip of previously captured photos and videos. It's annoying because you end up with a viewfinder that's about the same size as a phone's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the features, you get standard options like switching between the front and back camera, digital zoom, geotagging, exposure compensation and white balance. There's also a panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus can be set to auto, continuous, touch or infinity and you can pick between five scene presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the 8MP camera is not the best we've seen from Sony. Noise levels are fairly low, but the fine detail is as good as missing too. The camera has a tendency to overexpose shots (typical for an Xperia camera) and colors aren't perfect (white balance is a bit off resulting in bluish tint on occasion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, considering this is a tablet, the camera is probably too good than most people would need, so we won't hold the less than perfect image quality against the Tablet S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera of the Sony Xperia Tablet S gets into the fray in our Photo Quality Compare tool, which is mostly populated by phones rather than tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 8MP, it is one of the highest-res tablet cameras at the moment, although the sharpness of the camera is not on par with the best 8MP phone cameras as the first chart shows. Even the 5MP camera on the new iPad puts up a fight. The Xperia Tablet S relies on some pretty heavy sharpening to enhance the captured detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the second chart, colors look a bit dull and the patch of white noise has been processed beyond recognition. The gravel and grass patches are all but gone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third chart came out with a very noticeable blue tint (it's shot under artificial lighting) and the contrast was rather low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia Tablet S in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera on the Xperia Tablet S can record FullHD videos, while the front-facing camera is good for 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is identical to that of the still camera, though you lose most of the features - the autofocus modes (it always uses continuous autofocus), scenes and geotagging are gone. What you get is a time lapse option that snaps a frame every 1 to10 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are stored in MP4 files with around 14Mbps bitrate for the 1080p clips (almost the same bitrate as the one that Xperia phones use). Audio is stereo at 48kHz and 100Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quality is nothing to write home about, with less fine detail that we would expect out of a 1080p shooter. Colors are once again not accurate and photos are consistently overexposed. Again, we would only consider shooting a photo or a video with a tablet only when there is nothing else around (and how many people will buy a big Android tablet, but not have a smartphone on them?).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can also grab this untouched video sample - 1080p@30fps (10s, 16.3MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S can shoot 1080p videos, putting it on par with the best that mobile phone cameras has to offer. But how good is the quality, really?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic chart shows that practical resolution isn't quite on 1080p levels, despite the heavy sharpening that is applied to the video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity with TV remote functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes in two versions - Wi-Fi only and 3G+Wi-Fi. The 3G-enabled version comes with quad-band 2G mobile data support (no voice connectivity) and quad-band, HSPA+ enabled 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions have Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, meaning they will work on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. The transfer speed is rated at up to 150Mbps either way (you'll need a 802.11n network to get those speeds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you get a Tablet S without 3G, you can still use mobile Internet, provided you have a data plan on your droid phone and the Xperia Link installed. The app simplifies the tethering process. It puts a widget on the homescreen that lets you turn tethering on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might be thinking that you can just use your droid's Wi-Fi hotspot feature to do the same (and you could). The difference here is that Xperia Link uses Bluetooth to share the Internet connection and not Wi-Fi. This should be more power efficient than a Wi-Fi hotspot especially considering you can keep Bluetooth on all the time, which will let tablet and phone hook up automatically once they are close enough (can't do that with a hotspot or your battery will be dead in a couple of hours).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Tablet S also comes with Bluetooth 3.0 and a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connectivity, it has a standard 3.5mm audio jack on its right and a multi-port at the bottom, which handles charging, data connections with a computer and HDMI TV Out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One feature that we rarely find on mobile gadgets these days is the IR port on top. It's used to control digital appliances like TV sets, DVD and Blu-ray players, cable boxes and so on (and not to transfer data like in the olden days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The port comes complete with a Remote control app, which can handle multiple devices. Adding a new one is quick - you pick the type of device and the maker and the Tablet S will handle the rest. If your device is not on the list, you can teach the tablet its controls by pointing the remote at it and pressing the buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Remote control app is available as both a Small app and as a full-screen app, which offers more functionality. The Small app shows how Sony imagines people will use the tablet - watching TV, while browsing on the tablet (the so called "second screen viewing" is on the rise) and you can always change the channel, adjust the volume or do more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"More" comes in the form of macros - a list of actions that can trigger complex operations. You can, for example, switch the TV input mode to HDMI input and hit play, all with a single button press. When you create a macro, the tablet will make you go through each step so that it can time how long it takes the other device to react to each command (e.g. how long does switching between HDMI inputs take).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Default Android browser and Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is one of Android's strong suits and the Xperia Tablet S comes with both the default Browser app and Chrome for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Browser displays tabs on top of the screen, just like a desktop browser. You can open incognito tabs as well as set the browser to request desktop sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One trick that Sony has taught this browser is the ability to switch to the Small app so that you can keep the page you've open on screen while you use another app. You can only have one tab open in the Small app version (the current tab gets pulled from the big browser and moved into the small app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other features of the browser that we like are the Save for offline reading option and Quick controls. Quick controls offer a circular menu that's very easy to use with your thumb and on a tablet they display a total of 8 buttons (up from 4 on phones). Quick controls also hide the tabs at the top of the screen and leave more room for the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing speed is excellent and while the screen is comfortably big, we wish it had higher resolution as WXGA on a 9.4" screen doesn't quite cut it any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash comes preinstalled and the Tegra 3 chipset handles YouTube videos at 1080p easily. Games are no problem either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is also pre-installed on the Sony Xperia Tablet S. It has an almost identical-looking tabbed interface and it shares some of the features of the default browser, like Incognito mode and Request desktop site.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trade-off here is that while Chrome is faster and has better support for new web technologies, it doesn't support Flash or Quick controls (we really like those).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it does have over the other browser is tab syncing with the desktop Chrome browser. This means you can seamlessly switch from browsing on a computer to browsing on the Xperia Tablet S.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer without Office doc editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with the OfficeSuite document viewer pre-installed. We were a little disappointed that there's no document editor out of the box. That's a paid upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the app will view any Office document (DOC, XLS, PPT) and also PDF files. It uses a file browser split-screen interface that makes finding files quite easy and you can do basic file management with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app makes excellent use of the big screen. There are four view modes - Day, Week, Month and Agenda. In Day and Week views, there's a tiny calendar on the right that shows the full month and puts a dot below each day with events in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that calendar is a list of all calendars that are synced with the device and they are color coded. You can also tap on them to hide the events from a particular calendar to reduce clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator app is not as good at utilizing the 9.4" screen. It shows big buttons with the numbers 0-9, basic and some advanced math operators.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desk clock app lets you use the tablet as a desk clock and handles alarms too. You can set multiple alarms, each with a different repeat time and ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AccuWeather is preinstalled, which gives you beautiful, detailed weather info for multiple locations. It also gives you "lifestyle information" like how good the day is for riding a bike, fishing, barbeque, if there's a risk of catching a cold, the flu, having an asthma attack and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Evernote is also pre-installed on the Sony Xperia Tablet S. It keeps "notes" synced across multiple devices and users. A "note" can be anything from a hand-written note to web pages, photos, voice memos and others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some pre-installed applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Small apps have a couple of functions that aim to rival the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The first one is called Clip - it snaps a screenshot and lets you crop out a part of it (or use as it is), then you can scribble notes on top with several colors and an adjustable brush size. You can tag the result to help find it easier later or share it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other option is called Memo and works alike, but instead of a screenshot it starts off with a blank canvas. Memos can also be tagged and shared. This Small app has a couple of more options - it lets you enter text with the on-screen keyboard and change its background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scrapbook app is a more advanced version of those two. It lets you create Books, each with multiple pages. Like a true scrapbook, you can put just about anything here - scribble notes, add "clips" (the ones you've created with the Clips Small app), images, videos and songs. You can share a page of a book as a PNG image, but you can't share full books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zinio is preinstalled on the Tablet S - it's an app that lets you subscribe to a long list of digital magazines (paid ones), so you can read them on the tablet instead of the old ink on paper format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is in the ebook business and has, of course, pre-installed the Reader app. The app facilitates purchasing books from Sony but also offers old classics for free. The app has adjustable font size, day and night reading modes and supports both ePub and PDF books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a file transfer app, which allows you to easily transfer files between the built-in memory and the SD card or even attached mass storage devices. It's not a full-blown file manager though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps on a big screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in just over a minute with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Tablet S comes with the latest Google Maps and Navigation, which allow for easy caching of areas of the map for offline use along with offline re-routing. This means you can use Maps without a data connection and even if you do need to go online, the vector maps are very data efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now though, turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them, the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during your trip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store offers a huge number of apps, so you can be sure that you won't be short of software to install on your Xperia Tablet S. The only problem is the portion of the apps designed to work on a big screen is relatively small, especially when compared to the number of apps in the Apple App Store optimized for the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are featured apps, editors' picks and staff-recommended apps in addition to the usual top free and top paid. The Store will also recommend apps based on your download history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn't forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and apps are broken down into categories so you don't get lost.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ironic or convenient, our review comes out the day Sony announced putting the Xperia Tablet S on hold  over manufacturing faults. Essentially, the splash resistance is compromised and a recall is under way, meaning Sony already has a solution to the problem. If nothing else, this gives you some extra time to consider your options and our take on the Tablet S may help as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S is a big improvement over the original and as an overall package, a very nice Android tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still get the feeling that it's intended mostly as a stay-home tablet with all that IR remote functionality, the fold trading thickness for comfort and the Guest mode feature that lets the entire family share the tablet, each getting their own homescreen (and perhaps restrictions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's 11.9mm at its thickest and 8.8mm the rest of the way and with the QWERTY keyboard cover, the Xperia Tablet S might actually compete for the interest of road warriors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum back and splash-proof design certainly are a plus, though we really would have liked a 1080p (or WUXGA) option for the screen. Tegra 3 is more or less on par with the droid tablet competition and while the Tablet S doesn't run Jelly Bean yet, Sony's additions to the software are well appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for the Sony Xperia Tablet S, there are plenty of competing Android tablets in this same segment and with the market still not caring much for droid tablets we are not sure there will be enough room for everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it, the Tablet S main rival is going to be the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T. It costs around the same as the Tablet S and there's the option to buy a keyboard dock that turns it into a sort of netbook while also adding more battery life (Sony's QWERTY cover can't be tilted at any angle you like, nor does it have a battery in it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you'd like a screen upgrade to 1080p, we urge you to consider the Acer Iconia Tab A700. Sporting a Full HD LCD, a Tegra 3 chipset and an ampler battery, that one retails for just a fraction more than the Xperia Tablet S. It doesn't have as interesting design, but it still seems to provide more back for your buck than the Sony slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If must absolutely keep within the Xperia Tablet S budget, then Acer still has you covered with the A510. That one has a huge 9800 mAh battery working in its favor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Asus Transformer Pad TF300T ? Acer Iconia Tab A700 ? Acer Iconia Tab A510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to price though, it's hard to beat the brand new Barnes&amp;Noble Nook HD+. It has a 9" IPS LCD screen of 1920 x 1280 resolution and a dual-core CPU. It comes with 16GB of built-in storage at just $269 (or 32GB for $30 more) and it has a microSD card slot. Best of all, it's running Android 4.0 with a custom launcher rather than a heavily customized version of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to trade some Android feature for easy access to Amazon's vast multimedia library, you can also take a look at the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9". It uses the same TI OMAP 4470 chipset as the Nook, but it's screen has "only" 1080p resolution and costs $299 for the 16GB version (no microSD card slot there either). Both tablets have HDMI out but no Bluetooth, GPS or main camera (the Fire HD at least has a front cam).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that neither of those has access to Android's official app repository - the Play Store, so the selection of apps they get is pretty limited. Or at least until the good guys over at XDA-developers do their magic and enable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Google Nexus 7 tablet priced at just $199 (with 8GB of storage). We wouldn't normally mention a 7" tablet as an alternative to a 10-or-so incher, but this is pure Google, so we're making an exception. It runs the latest Android version and will enjoy fast-lane updates, but you have no microSD card slot, HDMI TV-Out, main camera and so on (there is Bluetooth and GPS connectivity though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Barnes&amp;Noble Nook HD+ ? Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 ? Asus Google Nexus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet S is fairly unique in design and features, but established competitors and relative newcomers like Barnes&amp;Noble are providing excellent products of their own at very competitive price points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while the Xperia Tablet S might be a good companion to your other Sony gadgets, it probably won't be the Android tablet that makes it big.</paragraph>
