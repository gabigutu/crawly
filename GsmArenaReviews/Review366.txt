			<paragraph>The non-OS Nokia phone with the richest equipment up-to-date is a highly stylish clamshell. The Nokia 7390 has 3G support, two colorful displays and an impressive 3.2 megapixel camera with auto focus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>       Nokia 7390: you will not necessarily like it at a first glance  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phones of the L'Amour collection rarely provoke hesitation in who thinks of buying them. One either gets in love with their extravagant design, or remains overwhelmed, but also shocked by their sophisticated construction. It is sure that Nokia 7390 is not a love-at-first-sight phone. When we obtained it for testing, we were slightly reserved about its typical Nokia style. Within a week of using the phone, however, we think rather different: Nokia 7390 now seems to be a perfect combination of style and functional equipment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant elaboration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is when mobile phones are evaluated that their looks are the most ambivalent characteristic to describe. That is why we prefer only to state that the darker version of Nokia 7390 is probably also the least controversial one in the entire L'Amour collection. In the course of the discussions in our office some colleagues expressed the opinion that Nokia 7390 is not suitable for men; I cannot agree, though. Of course, a gentleman would hardly pull out a pink-white phone from his pocket, but the other version in bronze-black would surely suit both ladies and gentlemen. Not to mention that the device may also be used as a luxurious accessory with dark clothes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       It could suit your T-shirt pretty well  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great part of the phone surface is made of plastic materials. Exceptions are the band around the external display, the silver line along the sides, the frame of the digital camera lens, which looks as if it?s made of metal, and the area covered with softer material for easier hand-hold on the rare side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I myself was somewhat disappointed by the fact that Nokia had decided not to implement a button for automatic opening in Nokia 7390 like they did in the 6131 model. Nevertheless, the phone is not difficult to open thanks to its round edges: just stick your finger between both its parts and open up. On one hand it shows stronger resistance if compared to the competitors; on the other hand both the top and the bottom parts lock in their end positions pretty reliably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Size: made for a hand-hold  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No pop-port<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The elements located on the sides of the phone will hardly surprise Nokia fans. Yet, there is one specialty: the key for switching on/off the phone and for switching between profiles has been modified, so the old uncomfortable one frequently commented on in numerous reviews has become a tiny control element located on the left side of the phone, and working with it is a real pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Functional key and Infrared port on the sides  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the switch-off button you will see a slot for wireless Infrared communication and a charger port. Nokia 7390 uses the newer, thinner charger connector. The opposite side features two elements: a dual volume control key and a camera release button. By the way, it will probably be the release button of the built-in camera that will surprise you the most at first glance. It is extremely soft and easy to press and one immediately expects it to make a mess when the phone is in a pocket for example. It does not though. It has two press levels due to the autofocus photo function, so a light press does not lead to shooting; a picture is only taken by a stronger press on the release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The switch-off button and the charger connector are both on phone?s right side ? miniUSB connector and a slot for the earphones on the top ? a textile etiquette like on a T-shirt ? the bottom is elements-free  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the phone is the most interesting. Even though it lacks Pop-Port, it is still able to communicate with other devices in almost all existing ways. Nokia seems to have woken up lately and has finally started to equip it models with a miniUSB system connector. The advantages? Fast, extensive standard communication; what?s more, you don?t need to buy additional data cables as you could use the one from your camera or MP3 player. Nearby there is a 2.5mm jack connector for your earphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Beauty at any cost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual for all Nokia phones of the L'Amour collection, Nokia 7390 has an ornamental wrist band, which looks more like a design accessory rather than a practical element. Anyway, be sure you treat it with care as intensive usage may convert it from a stylish decoration into an unsightly, ragged piece of something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Ornaments on the front ? leather on the back  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the eyelet for the wrist band and the microSD memory card slot under the rear cover, where the card does not fit perfectly, here you will also find a BP-5M Li-Ion battery. According to the official statements Nokia 7390 should provide you with 3 hours of call time (2 hours in UMTS network) and more than 9 days on stand-by. By the way, it was the durability of the battery that surprised us a lot; if not used intensively, the phone easily makes it for 5 days. The device is compatible with AC-3 and AC-4 chargers. Charging with the AC-3 model takes approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Buttons open everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once having given a light glance at the phone, your eye will also be caught by three buttons located beneath the external display. They facilitate the control of the phone?s multimedia functions. For example, you could run the radio, the music player or the camera without opening the phone; the last icon closes the keypad. However, the pictures shot with the camera do not come out pretty well on the tiny display; you?d better only use them in case of emergency. The mini-display also allows for deactivation of the alarm clock, confirmation of a reminder in the calendar etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main keypad is divided into two blocks ? a functional and a numeric one. Both are surrounded by a silver frame, between which and the nearby plastic surface there is a tiny gap, through which one can see into the internals of the keypad. Key distribution is standard, just like one would expect from a Nokia clamshell. The keypad is completely flat, on the same level like the rest of the phone surface. The only exception is the four-way control key. Even though there is a notable tendency for the keypad to go down in the area of the side columns or up where the middle column is, this helps very little for the overall orientation when typing. On the front, beneath the keypad you will also find the speaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Keys are big; control is generally comfortable with touchpad orientation being slightly more difficult  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The superb level of Nokia 7390?s design has been reached at the expense of user comfort. Keys are quite difficult to use, but getting accustomed is just a question of time. Key presses are accompanied by soft, but loud clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      A large speaker grill beneath the keypad  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backlighting is a joy for the eyes due to the successful distribution of the keys and their silver frame bedding. The light is decent and evenly distributed both under the keys and between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Keypad backlighting is weak, but sufficient  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu offers automatic keypad lock due to the ease with which external keys can be pressed when the device is in a pocket or a bag. Once the corresponding interval has been set up, the lock blocks both the external and the internal keys. The lock gets automatically unblocked if the phone is opened.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two colorful beauties<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad weaknesses are compensated by the highly professional elaboration of the display. Let?s start with the external one, able to show up to 262K colors on a resolution of 160 x 128 pixels. Using colorful wallpapers is not advisable though as they interfere with the character legibility significantly. If you prefer, you may set up a screensaver, animation that should appear when the phone is opened or a sleeping mode for a gradual deactivation of the display and battery saving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The external display features a small menu ? playing music ? changing a profile  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal display is a completely different story. It represents the maximum for non-OS phones. Nokia 7390 features a QVGA display (320 x 240 pixels), able to show up to 16 million colors, on which you could comfortably enjoy the finest images taken with its built-in camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        The main display occupies a great part of the surface ? the tiny camera reveals 3G ? QVGA resolution allows for displaying plenty of information  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will find a light sensor.. This way the phone tries to save the maximum amount of energy. Unlike the external display, the internal one is not able to visualize screen savers or other similar elements. If the phone is inactive, the backlighting gets weaker and the display goes out completely within a moment or so.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not so far away from smartphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 features Series 40 3rd Edition. As we have already written a lot about this platform, let us borrow and use several basic paragraphs (updated, of course) from previous models we have reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 is based on the latest, Series 40 third generation platform. The latter comes along with a new graphic interface, similar to the one applied in Nokia 6111 or Nokia 6280. In terms of common mobile phones this last-generation platform is pretty close to the behavior of smartphones. For example, Nokia 7390 can be switched on without a SIM card and you are given access to all the functions that do not require the presence of mobile network signal. The phone also features an active stand-by mode; several particular applications could be minimized while working, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Active stand-by mode ? settings in the active stand-by mode ? a standard stand-by display with wallpaper  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390?s interface responds to user?s orders quite fast. However, the third edition of S40 could have been even faster. Regarding the elevated number of errors we ran across in the test version of Nokia 7390, a conclusion can be made that the final version of the firmware is still to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now compare the active stand-by mode in Nokia 7390 with some other Nokia models with Symbian. In this new model, the top bar features the icons of the applications with shortcut access. A little bit lower you will see other functions like typing a brief note, visualization of the names of running music files or radio pieces, a stopwatch, whose organization depends on your preferences. The organizer only displays the calendar for the actual day, which is rather unpractical. In other words, it doesn?t show the agenda for the following day until the clock does not reach midnight. The lack of a Tasks application is also a drawback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire active stand-by mode is subject to possible modifications. The inconvenience is that it is located deep inside the menu. After all, the vagueness of the menu scheme is one of the most serious problems of the control of the new S40 3rd Edition platform; there is no doubt that the high amount of functions installed in the phone is not easy to order in a logical scheme, but even so, we consider this as a handicap. Even after having used Nokia 7390 for a long time, some users will still have difficulties with memorizing how and when some functions work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adjust it according to your needs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The left and the right context keys can be assigned a particular function. Should you use the active stand-by mode, there will be three configurable control ways at most. In the opposite case you can use all four ones. The confirming center provides access to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be organized in four ways: as a list, as a matrix grid, as a grid with legends or as horizontal fields. We found the grid without legends, where 12 icons fit into display, as the most suitable of all. All 12 icons can be relocated according to user?s will; the icon that is being moved gets highlighted in green, after which you need only to find it a new place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The main menu in different modes  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia know pretty well that personalization is important not only for user?s comfortable control, but also for the creation of a specific looks of the phone interface, through which the owner expresses its preferences. Nokia 7390 meets both requirements brilliantly as it allows for every important, rational function to be user-configured. For example, in the ?Gallery? you can choose which elements should appear directly: image thumbnails, full file names in a column, or file names and details about date of creation and size. There are numerous settings like this one in the menu system.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You like colors?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 supports graphic themes, which not only change wallpaper on the main display, but also modify the graphics of the other screens. While a great part of the models based on S40 3rd Edition uses a blue default scheme, Nokia 7390 features several colorful combinations, which favor the final outlook of the phone a lot. Font color can be modified from the menu if legibility requires it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Nokia 7390 offers plenty of graphic themes; others can be downloaded from Internet  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution of 320 x 240 pixels provides the phone (at least theoretically) with good visualization options. In this sense it is quite strange that the company?s designers have used unnecessarily big fonts, due to which only half of the possible information fits into the display. A similar problem exists with font visualization in the active stand-by mode, where letter borders always remain white and thus look somewhat unattractively. In this case the advantages of the QVGA display basically remain unused.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call functions are brilliant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 works in GSM networks at 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz, and also in UMTS (WCDMA 2100 MHz); it also supports data transfers via GPRS and EDGE. The ringtone of incoming calls can be silenced by opening the phone and pressing a particular key. The sound quality of the calls is good, but we know Nokia can make better ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Ringing profile setup ? call register  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, however, do not forget that we pay attention to every single detail; any common user should be absolutely satisfied. The speaker located beneath the keypad creates sounds of satisfying quality too. Nokia 7390 also offers video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook features several visualization options. You can set a classical font as well as a large-size font as a default one. The entries stored on the SIM card and those saved in the phone memory can all be displayed simultaneously. Nokia 7390 has space for 1000 contacts, each of which can be assigned up to 20 different fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Two of the numerous looks of the phonebook  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In advanced setup levels you can state, whether contacts should be organized by first or last name. You can modify your selection further on by selecting among options like ?list of names?, ?name and number? or ?name and image?. The phonebook is searched by gradual typing of the letters of the desired name. Groups with special images and ringtones for better order in the contacts are available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It knows you all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All names in the phonebook can be called via voice dialing. Nokia 7390 does not require prior teaching; it recognizes anyone?s voice and it does it brilliantly. You have to press the corresponding key and pronounce the name of the person you want to call. The phone will visualize their image, read their name with an automatic voice and dial the number set as default. In the same way, that is, without prior teaching, you could also activate several particular functions. Each number in the phonebook can be assigned a shortcut key access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Each contact can be assigned plenty of fields  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can be used as call filters in the ringing profiles. Nokia 7390 also offers the so called timed profiles; when you activate one of these you could set up its deactivation time right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside a profile you can set up different ringtones for calls, messages, emails and chat. Volume level, vibrations, keypad tones and the above mentioned filters are selected from here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Phonebook setup ? a view at a contact ? group setup  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 plays sounds in 64-voice polyphony when it uses MIDI files. MP3 or AAC files or even video ringtones when incoming calls are accompanied by a video record are far more attractive, though. Ringing with vibrations is decent, it does not make the phone body rock around, but sometimes it is much too quiet. If you are walking, for example, you will have no chance to notice an incoming SMS alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events get all listed on the main display; when you select one of them, the phone switches straight to a simpler version of the call register, where all calls to the same contact are unified and you only see the number of all made calls and the time of the last one. Beside, however, Nokia 7390 offers a complete Call log, where all types of calls are chronologically organized, including multiple tries. The phone has two more particular folders: Message recipients and Data transfer reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MMS in several modes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 manages SMS, MMS and emails as well as the so called sound messages (MMS consisting of a sound file only) and messages straight on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Message menu ? creating a new message ? creating a MMS  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS are created in two ways. One is the ?standard? one, when you simply insert images and other elements (text, video, sound, business card, and note from the calendar). The MMS plus editor, however, hides a few novelties: the first one is the option for sending high-resolution images (common MMS editors cut pixels automatically in order to make images fit the display and the phone size). If you want to attach a second image, this will already get modified according to the resting space in the MMS. The limit per MMS is 300 kB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS+T9: a dream team<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T9 dictionary is pretty intelligent; it features a rich vocabulary and maintains a record of preferred words and phrases, which it offers on first position. The editor counts characters from 1000 downwards and displays the number of typed sub-messages (7 at the most).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Typing a SMS  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like in smartphones, here you could also select the addressee of your message straight from a bar in the top of the editor. We also appreciate the option to send a message to one of the recent contacts or to a person from the list with last received or made calls. Groups can be applied too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS delivery notifications are set up either for all messages, or separately for each message. They pop up on the display for a little while, after which they get saved. The state of all deliveries is checked through a separate folder in the message menu, but is also available in an icon attached to each sent message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email browser is a Java application. When you open it, it immediately offers you a selection of frequently used email services (AIM, AOL, Yahoo, and Gmail). While the interface in other phone areas uses an inadequately large font, the email client offers a superb folder list with font size just as big as to make visualization the best possible. Regretfully, this does not hold true for the email editor or the text body of the emails alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Emails are managed separately ? writing an email  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client works well with the phonebook and the addresses stored in it. It manages attachments seamlessly. They can be saved and eventually opened as long as the phone supports the format they have been created in. The maximum size of an email message is 300 KB, so be careful with larger attachments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It remains a mobile phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 is equipped with a 3.2 megapixel built-in camera. The finest images have 1536 x 2048 pixels, but lower resolution is available as well. Each resolution selection further offers three quality levels ? high, normal, basic. The higher the resolution of the image, the longer it takes the phone to save it, but also the better the result is. Logically, the lowest quality corresponds to the smallest image size; if you are to send images in MMS, then shooting at higher resolution simply makes no sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Taking picture by using the tiny external display  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can be held horizontally due to the comfortable location of the camera release button. The display remains somewhat tipped out, but it doesn?t matter for shooting. The camera release button has two positions. When half-pressed, it runs the autofocus. A full press takes the shot and saves the image. Besides, you could also shoot by pressing the confirming center of the control key; the only difference is that you will not be able to use the autofocus function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the camera is not active, a press on the release button opens the camera control interface, which provides a structure overview of the most important settings. That is why most of the latter (like camera activation, number of images/amount of time left, zoom application, white balance or other effects) are visible straight on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Camera viewfinder ? camera menu ? the viewfinder in the camera mode  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the camera you will find a LED for night shooting. Both LED settings and flash are user-configurable. This way you can choose whether the image you are shooting should be constantly illuminated or just automatically, after a press on the release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though we checked every single spot of the interface, we could not find a function for switching between the front and the back camera. It seems that every time you need to make yourself a self-portrait, it will be necessary to turn the phone and ask somebody to adjust the image on the display. A closer look at the photos taken with Nokia 7390 reveals that the number of megapixels is not the only decisive quality factor. The pictures are characterized by disturbing noise, which only disappears when light conditions are perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at various sample photos taken with Nokia 7390</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The errors typical for any non-final firmware are most visible in the camera application. Even though according to Nokia official site the highest video resolution in Nokia 7390 is 352 x 288 pixels, we also found a 640 x 480 option in the camera settings. Nevertheless, when we selected the latter, the camera refused to run and displayed a ?no memory? alert. In a result, we had to switch to the lower, standard resolution anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is a pity that Nokia has once again lowered quality standards. Many users would have appreciated good quality video records in VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels) than 3 megapixel images of average quality. Besides, Nokia has already proven its skills in VGA in models like Nokia 6280 and 6233.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    File manager in the memory  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It will organize your life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar is practical and quite complete so we will only make a brief overview of its options. Month and week views are well organized; the calendar stays visible in the top part of the display, while the bottom bar is reserved for the events on each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer offers 5 event types: meeting, call, birthday, note, and reminder. Inside the meeting type you will find other options like subject, place, starting date and time, end date and time, alert date and time, alert type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, monthly, annually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Organizer?s menu ? alarm clock  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task list is very simple. Here you can only add subject, priority, deadline and alert type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off; tasks can be organized in an alphabetic order or by deadline as well as moved into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers useful text notes that get synchronized with PC and allow longer texts to be downloaded into the phone. A single note could contain up to three thousand characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Calendar  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7390 features a pretty good alarm clock. It wakes you up with any sound from the phone memory. You can even use the radio as an alarm. The sound comes out through the speaker, but do not forget to plug in the earphones as they serve as an antenna. Without the earphones the radio will not run and the phone will wake you up with a standard sound. Repetition days and even the intervals between repetitions are user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further in the organizer menu you will find a countdown timer, a stopwatch with split and lap timing, and a detailed calculator managing not only basic mathematical operations but also memory, goniometrical, power or fraction operations. Also available are several Java applications: size converter, world time, and the so called Sensor (similar to its symbian brother).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     A menu with extra functions ? smart size converter  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four preset Java games in the phone. In the application Music Guess you can try recognizing music pieces. Rally 3D ? as clear from the name - is a racing game. Two mobile legends meet in an attractive even if not so successful 3D version of the famous Snake. The last game is a flash Sudoku.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Four games for boring moments  </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-color play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is a short manual on how the music player in Nokia 7390 is controlled: save the corresponding file into the phone memory or onto a memory card, run the music player, wait for it until it looks up the new items in the file structure and then listen to the result. Control functions like fast forwarding, switch between music pieces etc. are viewed on the display in the form of a four-way control key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player menu allows for organizing files in a custom way or by artist/album/genre/composer. There is also an integrated five-band equalizer, which changes the sound in five pre-set or two user-configurable editing options. Besides, Nokia 7390 is able to play music through Bluetooth as well as to download files from Internet. Repeat and shuffle are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Music player ? Playlist ? music library ? equalizer ? the music player in active stand-by mode  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike other applications the music player can be minimized while one works with the phone functions. Running music files are visualized on the active stand-by display, from where it is possible to fast forward songs or switch from one song to another. Playing gets stopped when a call is coming in or another multimedia function (camera, radio) is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned several times already, Nokia 7390 is equipped with an integrated FM tuner. In order to receive radio broadcast you need to plug in the earphones as they serve as an antenna. The radio options alone fit into Nokia standards ? you can save radio stations, search stations automatically, switch between mono and stereo output, or let the sound go out through the built-in speakers. Unfortunately, Nokia 7390 does not feature RDS, that is, it cannot receive radio station data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       You will find a radio in the menu ? video playing ? video in full-screen mode ? video player menu  </paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Abundance of memory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the retail package along with the phone itself you will also find a number of interesting accessories. Even though Nokia 7390 is not advertised as a multimedia phone, it comes along with a microSD 128 MB memory card and a standard SD adapter for memory card readers. (Let us just add that users have 21 MB of internal memory space). Here you will also find a wired stereo headset Nokia HS-60 for listening to music and voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       In the retail package you will find a 128MB microSD card with an adapter for SD size ? earphones are especially attractive  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia remains non-conventional even in the elaboration of its headset. Instead of common wires it has applied a non-traditional slip over one?s head; besides, the set is so long that storing it will create you worries rather than pleasure. The remote control only features two keys for switching between songs / stations and activation of voice dialing; it does not allow you to control volume, play / stop music files or receive calls. The latter functions are reached through keys on the external cover of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the retail package you will also find a stylish silver wrist band. To our opinion, silver is not the material that suits black the most, but on the other hand, when Nokia creates extravagant models, extravagancy usually breathes from every single detail. Nokia 7390 is no exception to the rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Another interesting accessory is the metal wrist band  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as data options are concerned, Nokia 7390 offers nearly all of them: you are going to appreciate GPRS Class 10 in GSM networks as well as its faster EDGE version, also in Class 10. If you?d like to communicate even faster, you can use 3G networks. The phone communicates with other devices via wireless technologies like IrDA and Bluetooth. If you do not mind wires, then you may also use the above mentioned miniUSB connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Internet browser  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A special device for special users<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia stylish phones have always been somehow special, different, so it is difficult to state who their direct competitors are. On the other hand, functions play an important role too. One of the most serious rivals for Nokia 7390 in the category of 300-350 euros will be Sony Ericsson K800. The most serious advantages of the latter are its 70 MB internal memory, its built-in camera that creates higher-quality images than the camera in Nokia 7390 and its competitive price. On the other hand, Nokia 7390 has an external display with better saturation, and most of all ? EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Nokia 7390 is not only a design product, but also a device of superb functions. Care is visible even in the tiniest details. The only drawback is the phone?s price of 380 euro. For this money nowadays you could easily have a high-end phone, including a smartphone with an OS and plenty of additional options.</paragraph>
