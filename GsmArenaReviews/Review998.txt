			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having finally scored a homerun, and a desperately needed one at that, Sony is keen to bring another hitter off the bench. And they sure hope it's the Cadillac-driving kind. The Japanese mean business - and the Xperia Z did its best to get that point across. The Xperia ZL now has plenty of momentum to build on but a certain weight of expectations too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The double-backup is something Samsung has been doing for a couple of years now with a Galaxy S flagship in the spring followed by a Note phablet at the end of summer. Sony's going for what looks more like a one-two punch with the glass-clad, water-proof Xperia Z and the more compact, less extravagant, but just as premium Xperia ZL. The timeframe for their arrival to market has been shortened too - pretty much a must, considering that chipset is only getting older.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony needs users to like the ZL, because the Z probably won't make it on its own. On paper, the Xperia ZL has all the trimmings of its sibling save for the IP57 certification. And it should be just as capable as most other flagships of the latest generation. Here go the specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're after a FullHD five-incher the Xperia ZL is the most compact handset that fits the bill. The difference, of course, is by no means huge but having a smaller footprint than the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great achievement. On the other hand, a 10 mm thick body is nothing to brag about. Yet, if that's the price for getting a proper shutter key and an Infrared port, it should be fine for most people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Sony opted for two distinct versions of a 2013 flagship and then had to sit down and think about how to make them... distinct. Having a more compact option of what's virtually the same package as the flagship makes every bit of sense. But is it worth the extra millimeters around the waistline?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was probably important to Sony to send a clear message that what's on offer is essentially the same package - the difference boils down to size, choice of finish and waterproofing or not. A sensible plastic case doesn't look half as good as glass but has its advantages. Water resistance is a great asset but not everyone needs it. Plus... a proper shutter key, half press and all, is something we always welcome in a cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But will Sony's two-flagship strategy pay off? Can the Xperia ZL coexist with its better-looking, and ultimately more prominent, sibling or is it better off as a regional option? What kind of users do these two have in mind? It's the kind of questions we'll be trying to answer, while we explore the Sony Xperia ZL. Let's get going.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xperia ZL<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL comes in an identical box, in terms of both design and contents, to that of the Xperia Z. Our Xperia Z unit came with a complimentary 2GB memory card, which the Sony Xperia ZL doesn't have, but that's hardly a big deal. You do get an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and a headset with an extra pair of earbuds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia ZL 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL is the 5" smartphone with the smallest footprint on the market. At 131.6 x 69.3 x 9.8 mm you won't get anything better among its immediate rivals in the face of the Xperia Z (139 mm tall), Samsung Galaxy S4 (136.6 mm) or the HTC One (137.4 mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Xperia ZL is the thickest of them all at 9.8mm. We didn't find this particularly bothersome - the Sony Xperia ZL is quite comfortable to handle and allows a decent grip. More so than the glass-covered Xperia Z.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The smaller footpring is probably the first thing the Xperia ZL will use in its defense, as many users are likely to question the absence of high-end finish. If recent history has thought us anything, it's that there are enough people who value handling over fancy design. We, for one, are not too fond of the textured battery cover but plastic is clearly something you don't have to worry about as much as you would for the glass rear panel on the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL is being pitched as the most compact smartphone with a 5"1080p screen and the amount of space below and above of the screen is an easy to spot difference to the Xperia Z. The top and bottom bezel have been noticeably shrunk and that's perhaps the reason why the front camera is located in the bottom right corner - a bit unusual, but not unprecedented (remember the Nokia N9?). The side bezels too have been reduced to the bare minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chrome insets on the sides of the handsets are one of the few similarities with the Xperia Z. The reflective plates are a nice accent and come in the same light graphite color as on the water-resistant Xperia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is using a similar simplistic front on the Sony Xperia ZL with no hardware buttons on the glass. Capacitive on-screen controls are used instead that stay out of the way while browsing the web or viewing images, playing games or watching videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The breathing LED (Sony call it ambience light) is discretely hidden beneath the glass under the Home key. It illuminates a tiny slit that grows thinner at the edges and looks classy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you'll spot the earpiece and the Sony logo. Sony smartphones usually come with a factory-fitted screen protector on top of the scratch-resistant glass and the Xperia ZL is no exception. Sometimes the manufacturer logo is even printed on the thin screen protector sheet itself. Most people probably won't mind the extra protection as long as it doesn't compromise the viewing angles and overall image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Sony Xperia ZL is made of patterned plastic which rugged texture facilitates the grip but looks a bit tacky. The back accommodates the 13MP camera lens, which is raised above the surrounding surface. Next to it are the loudspeaker grille and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary, noise-reducing microphone is above the lens, with the Xperia logo imprinted across the middle of the rear panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sure looks like a removable back panel but it isn't. In order to access the microSD card slot and microSIM card you have to undo the tiny flap at the very bottom of the smartphone. Getting it open tends to be a fiddly exercise and it doesn't really lock firmly back in place. Not to mention, the questionable aesthetics - the flap really looks like a patch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we didn't quite like about the plastic back cover of the Sony Xperia ZL is the fact that it noticeably bends and gives in even when gently pressed. That's not the most reassuring feeling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the Sony Xperia ZL is the size - and the easiest way to appreciate the difference is to have an Xperia Z in the other hand. The Xperia ZL doesn't even come close to the level of refinement of its glass-clad sibling, but the grip and the handling definitely tip the scales in its favor. We wouldn't say the Xperia ZL was made entirely with single-handed use in mind but it's easier to handle most of the five-inchers we've tested, and it's probably tied with the Galaxy S4 despite the thicker profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The materials are sensible and pleasant to the touch and the build quality is solid for the most part. The only exception is the underwhelming fit of the back panel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5" 1080p TFT with the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, we found that the Sony Xperia ZL in an improvement over the Xperia Z in the screen department. Given that that the two are identical on paper (FullHD resolution on a 5" diagonal, 441ppi) and come from the same manufacturer we'd suggest this is due to unit variances, rather than Sony having designed a second panel of this type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TFT screen is backed by the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2, which enhances contrast and sharpness, brings down noise and saturates colors to make them more pleasing to the eye. The reds in particular tend to really pop out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one area that Sony has improved here is contrast and we all know that that an upgrade was due here. However, the likes of the HTC One, LG optimus G Pro and HTC Butterfly still hold an advantage here, not to mention the Super AMOLED unit on the Samsung Galaxy S4, which has virtually infinite contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a closer look at the Xperia ZL's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Sony Xperia ZL and Xperia Z screens under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the subjects of viewing angles. The Sony Xperia ZL display isn't terribly poor in that regard, but compared to just about every high-end smartphone out there it's clearly inferior. We've got used to the printed look that these ultra-wide viewing angles give, so we are not particularly fond of the treatment the Xperia ZL is giving us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some quote narrower viewing angles as an advantage as it helps your privacy in public places, but it certainly takes away some of the high-end vibe of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the sunlight legibility on the Sony Xperia ZL is decent, if not quite up there with the best. You will normally be able to operate the smartphone trouble-free outdoors, but in brighter environments you might need to work a bit harder to find a proper angle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen keys of the Sony Xperia ZL are always on except when you're viewing photos, watching video, browsing the web or playing a game. Even in these scenarios the keys easily come back up with a quick tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grey strip at the bottom of the screen isn't the best background for the virtual controls. The Xperia ZL screen has a decent contrast but a black background would've still been a better choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2MP front-facing camera is capable of 1080p video recording and is placed in the bottom right corner. The location clearly favors landscape orientation when making video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the microUSB port, which is exposed, unlike on the water-resistant Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, you'll find the volume rocker near the top, the prominent power/lock button (placed dead center) and a two-step camera button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We always appreciate a dedicated camera button on a phone, even more so when the camera is worth its salt. The shutter button on the Sony Xperia Zl has great overall feedback and distinct half-press. It's also light on the finger so you won't get blurry shots trying to push the button all the way down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Sony Xperia ZL only features the 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a lanyard eyelet in the bottom left corner of the Sony Xperia ZL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has done well to make the Xperia ZL quite comfortable to use. The controls are comfortably placed and very responsive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL comes with a 2370mAh battery, which is 40mAh more than the Xperia Z offers. Somewhat surprisingly, it is officially rated to last for just 13 h of 3G talk time and up to 500 h of stand-by (vs 14h and 530h, respectively for the Xperia Z). Perhaps the different display unit used here is part of the explanation, but our dedicated battery test also found the Xperia ZL to have a slightly shorter endurance than the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL managed an overall endurance score of 44h, which comes 4h short of the achievement of its sibling. That's still a decent score, suggesting that you will only need to charge the smartphone every other day if you an hour of talking, an hour of browsing and an hour of video playback per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should also keep in mind that the Sony Xperia ZL comes with the company's home-brewed Stamina mode, which has great effect on the stand-by efficiency and if you stick to it, you will get much better power autonomy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about our testing procedures here. If you are interested how these results compare to other tested devices, check out our battery life test result table.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia ZL runs on 4.1 Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL runs on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, the same firmware ticking inside the water-resistant Xperia Z. Just like with the Xperia Z, Sony promises to bring 4.2 Jelly Bean update soon to the Xperia ZL as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called Project Butter combined with the powerful quad-core chipset and graphics, give you as smooth a ride throughout the Xperia ZL UI as you can expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia ZL flagship in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The Xperia ZL gives you the option to change the number of homescreen panes (by adding more or removing some of the default 5) and even select any of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone - add widget, shortcuts to apps, change the wallpaper and change the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it to add it to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Unfortunately, the widgets in the Xperia ZL do not resize or re-arrange automatically, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them. Depending on the color you've chosen the hidden LED light below the screen will light up with the same color tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no overview mode as it was with previous Sony Xperia smartphones. Instead, you get the homescreen edit menu when you do the familiar pinching gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has been redesigned too. It uses a new cool default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and now features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. For some reason, the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is organized in pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome task manager we met on the Xperia T is also here. It lets you go to the recently opened apps as well as remove them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage system service is onboard too. It also lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android ICS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, restoring them with the previous saved settings. The reset option is in the same submenu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Raw performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL uses a Snapdragon APQ8064 S4 Pro chipset, the same that powers the Xperia Z. It packs four Krait CPU cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. Just like we expected it scores the same results on the synthetic benchmarks as the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite there are already available faster quad-core processors - the Krait 300 from the Snapdragon 600 chipset (Galaxy S4, Optimus G Pro) and the Cortex-A15 (Galaxy S4), the Xperia ZL CPU still does a great job and will handle even the heaviest tasks hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes up fourth in Benchmark Pi (which is all about single-threaded performance), it's also fourth in Linpack (which focuses on multithreading), fourth in AnTuTu and fifth in Quadrant compound benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the Xperia ZL scored less than the Xperia Z on GeekBench 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Xperia ZL didn't disappoint, scoring as high as the Xperia Z Oppo Find 5 and the Nexus 4, and a tad better than the iPhone 5, though the Snapdragon 600-powered HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 did notably better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The benchmark was run at the High Quality setting and yet the Xperia ZL did as good as the rest of the flagships participating in our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like other droids that come with Google Chrome as default web browser we expected mid-range performance, but as it turns out Chrome has become a lot faster after its latest software update. The Xperia ZL scored 1290ms on SunSpider, faster than the Xperia Z, LG Optimus G and Nexus 4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BrowserMark 2 and the HTCM5 Vellamo test the Xperia ZL occupied the fourth place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum things up, Sony once again has managed to extract more performance from the four Krait cores than any manufacturer to use this chipset. The Adreno 320 GPU does equally well - it manages playable frame rates using a real-world 3D engine at FullHD resolution. It's hardly a surprise then, that the overall user experience with this one is smooth as butter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia ZL gets activated with a press-and-hold of the virtual Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a review of all popular voice assistants and you can learn even more about Google Now there. Just follow this link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL phonebook looks slightly different from what we're used to in ICS and thanks to the light background it looks livelier. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu. The contacts, phone, favorites and groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia ZL was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia ZL automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia ZL, and the results were close to excellence. Scoring a Very Good result promises you won't miss any notification with the Xperia ZL. If you turn on the xLOUD option and turn off ClearPhase you get louder speakerphone even if of slightly inferior quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layouts. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia ZL offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL comes with the new Sony gallery, called Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with cool animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the hidden LED below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy video player, plays everything but lacks AC3 support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL did a very good job with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD, even MKV. The only exception was AC3 audio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video editing app called Movie Studio is bundled too. It lets you edit video, images, and audio together (both imported from files as well as recorded/taken by the device itself), using a variety of cool transitions. You can then export the resulting project into a video file that you can share using the Z's generous connectivity features (more on this below).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music when listening on the pre-bundled Sony headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However die-hard audiophiles might prefer additional players, which sport a 10-band or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and adds bookmarks to stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got great scores all over and garnished them with average volume levels, making up for one of the good performances we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but things certainly aren't too bad. The stereo crosstalk rises very subtly and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels remain about average. A solid overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels. However, if you use the default Superior auto mode, you only get 12 MP 3920 x 2940 shots instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and regular mode with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode and what not. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From what our experience so far shows, though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are a photography enthusiast or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia ZL camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture and HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video. This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but it is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module and firmware is the same we met within the Xperia Z and managed to disappoint us for a second time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Superior auto mode the Sony Xperia ZL produces photos with pleasing, albeit slightly oversaturated colors. The resolved detail is hardly spectacular and the noise levels are only average, but the dynamic range is good and contrast is excellent. The results are good overall, although we wouldn't say it has a significant advantage over the best 8MP shooters from last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you switch the regular auto mode, you get images that appear more natural and lack that overprocessed look. This gives you more headroom if you plan on post-processing your images, but resolved detail doesn't change significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, just as on the Xperia Z, the default image processing of the Xperia ZL is far from stellar. As a result, the regular shooting mode produces shots that look worse than the ones, captured in Burst mode at 9.6MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normal processing has super aggressive and quite clumsy noise suppression algorithm, which smears out the foliage and the roof tiles, while making the purple fringing around the white windows more visible. It does remove some of the noise though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Burst shot mode, on the other hand, seems to skip this processing step and while the shots are slightly grainier, the foliage in the tree looks much better and you get much more detail in the fire escape and roof tiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To recap, Burst mode gives you better per-pixel detail because it doesn't process the images as much. Were Sony to skip the heavy-handed post-processing, the image output would have been at an entirely different photo quality level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Burst shot is a stop-gap measure (you lose resolution, FoV, touch focus) until Sony pushes out an update to fix things (if they act on this at all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing with the camera tour, we also gave the Panorama feature a whirl. The smartphone produced a 5 megapixel image with punchy colors and only few stitching errors. It's not the best panorama we have seen, but it's certainly among the better performers out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an HDR sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL challenges the best 13MP shooters in town and despite it resolves as much detail as the Galaxy S4 and LG Optimus G Pro, there is lots of edge fringing. Unfortunately, when it comes to a more real-life scenario (the third poster), the noise reduction takes its toll and the Xperia ZL photos further lose their appeal.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Xperia ZL does 1080p HDR videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL is capable of capturing 1080p video footage at 30fps, which is on par with most modern day smartphones. However, as a nice extra touch, the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it only the third one to have that after the Oppo Find 5 and Sony's own Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia ZL is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 1 megapixel of resolution. That's less than half the resolution of the individual frames in the video itself and not really good for much. Given that last year's flagships could capture full res stills during video recording, what the Xperia ZL offers is inexcusably poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a minor thing however and what's important is the Xperia ZL does the major things right. Videos come up with very good detail and a solid 30fps framerate. Their bitrate hovers about the 17MBps mark, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p video sample as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benefits of the HDR mode are not always as easily visible as we hoped, but it still adds some detail in the highlight areas, which, on some occasions, can mean the difference between a usable and a poor video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download an untouched 1080p HDR video too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL enters the arena of our video quality comparisons. The 1080p video recording of the smartphone isn't quite the best we have seen, but it fares pretty well. It easily matched the Optimus G and the Galaxy S III in the first two charts, but came out a distant third on the third chart.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity package includes LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL has quad-band 2G and tri-band 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds are an impressive 42 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA. There is also up to six-band (region dependent) LTE support with 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and connecting to your PC and there's also USB On-the-go support so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia ZL but you can get it through the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL however comes with a real Infrared port and can be used a regular remote control. Sony has pre-installed a dedicated Remote Control app that can operate with various models of TVs, VCRs, various Set-Top Boxes, home theater systems, DVD/Blu-ray players, iPod docks, projectors, etc. There is a manual setup as well. The app has easy to use interface and may turn your Xperia ZL into a universal remote for all of your gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL also comes with NFC connectivity, although that's easy to overlook considering there are no included NFC tags in the retail package (like with other NFC-enabled Xperia models), and the Xperia SmartTags app used to manage them is also not present. In the settings though you can find and use Google Wallet and Android Beam functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you have an Xperia tablet, Xperia link is a simple app that lets you share the internet connection from your phone to your tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is Android's default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome as well as Android Jelly Bean does not support Adobe Flash, so getting it working on Xperia ZL seems out of the question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL offers a completely new social service, replacing the previously popular Timescape. It's called Socialife.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife is a Sony home-made app that supports Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Reader accounts. You have a unified Stream page where you can view every social notification that you have order chronologically or by the Smart Sorting feature. The latter puts the stories you might be interesting before others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Post field which from where you can update your Facebook and Twitter statuses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service offers four widgets - two for your stream with different visual styles, one for quick social status update and one with quick shortcuts to your social friends. The latter also shows new notifications with small balloons in the upper right corner (the iOS style).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL comes with the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 allows you to view almost any type of document, although you'll have to fork over for the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia ZL. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also an option for Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver setting helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold, turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off the mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also includes advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store is full of free apps that will cater to all your organizational needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline maps, Google and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot is also part of the Sony Xperia ZL package, with a navigation license for 30-days and downloadable maps for offline navigation. You need to pay extra to continue using the app once the trial has expired, though. Unfortunately it was not working on our unit due to some incompatibility with the Android version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is the gate to the app world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Xperia ZL has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, why the Sony Xperia ZL and not the Xperia Z? To begin with, this is a question many of you will never be asking, as the pair will not be officially available at the same time on most markets. At first glance, the best case scenario for the Xperia ZL would be for them to never cross paths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mean, the Xperia ZL is a seriously good regional version of the current flagship but one that we would be hard-pressed to recommend over the more sophisticated, on top of being waterproofed, Xperia Z. On a second thought though, a more compact - and therefore more comfortable to handle - package will be an alternative enough people would be willing to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZL is powered by the same quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset ticking inside the Xperia Z and though it's no longer the best there is (Snapdragon 600, Exynos Octa), it still is a top-notch piece of hardware that will handle whatever you throw at it. The 5" 1080p TFT screen could've been at least slightly better though. OK, you can put the privacy spin on the limited viewing angles but you will have a lot harder time finding an excuse for the mediocre contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, this shouldn't be held against the Xperia ZL alone - in fact, our unit come with a screen better than the proper flagship, so it might actually work to its advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, these are virtually identical packages and the choice boils down to premium looks and better grip, water proofing and more comfortable handling. There're things too like a hardware shutter key and an infrared port on the Xperia ZL. Probably enough for a regional version - but is it enough to justify a pair of almost equal high-end phones? Given that wider choice always works to the benefit of users, we'd say yes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to make it even more complicated, the real competition comes into play. The already available HTC One has a slightly smaller but clearly superior screen, an optically stabilized camera, better audio output, a pair of stereo speakers and killer looks. Sure, the 4MP camera, whatever HTC calls it, might not be everyone's cup of tea but it gets the job done on most occasions and it's low-light performance is something to look forward to. The non-expandable storage is hardly ideal and the HTC One costs about &#x20ac;50 more than the Xperia ZL (not to mention the supply shortages), but it's definitely worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more serious threat for the Xperia ZL is, of course, the Samsung Galaxy S4. It has the richest hardware and software package on the market, no matter whether you are looking at the Snapdragon 600 or the Exynos 5 Octa powered model. The latest Galaxy flagship boasts a 5-inch SuperAMOLED, a more impressive camera and a set of advanced gestures. In fact with the Xperia ZL lacking the sleek look of the Xperia Z, it's quite easy to recommend the Samsung flagship (which has uninspiring design as its sole shortcoming) over it despite the slightly higher asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 &#x2022; Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 and ZTE Grand S come from makers that are rising in popularity and offer flagship specs, without the premium name tax. Finding either of those in your local stores can be quite hard, though. There is the Asus Padfone Infinity too, which adds a 10.1" tablet dock, but you should make sure you need that as it costs an arm and a leg.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Oppo Find 5 &#x2022; ZTE Grand S &#x2022; Asus PadFone Infinity</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZL is not as good looking as its glass-clad sibling, or most of the direct rivals for that matter. Nor is it the most powerful device on the market. We're tempted to call the Xperia Z the better part of the pair and forget about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most compact FullHD five-incher is the Xperia ZL's defining feature - and the emphasis is on compact. But ... the Xperia ZL is a FullHD five-incher after all, and for Sony having two horses in the flagship race must feel good. Plus, there's always people who like to cheer for the dark horse.</paragraph>
