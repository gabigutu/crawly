			<paragraph>Everything started with the Razr. The success of the ultra thin clamshell has put Motorola on the top of the high-class phones. Intended for the ordinary user with its reasonable price, the Motorola L6 follows the example. The equipment however won't shine much; at least the construction will inspire.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nowadays, the legendary Motorola Razr V3 already means a revolution in the mobile world. With this model Motorola showed how far the design limits can reach. Due to the success achieved by the Razr, the manufacturer decided that the stylish clamshell won't be the last piece form the thin "razor" series. So, with small proportions, but with affordable price, here comes - the Motorola L6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L6 model was officially presented at the CeBIT fair last year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phone fits in palm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The biggest temptations for the customer are without question the small size and the thin side view. With its proportions of 114 x 49 x 12 mm the Motorola L6 is still standing in the category of the very small devices. Its weight of 85 g may only cause envy in the other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola L6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison with the Razr, the Motorola L6 is not so wide, which at first sight will warm the heart of many users. You can hold it in your hands very comfortable due to the reduced width. Operating with the thumb is easy as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first sight the L6 seems to have very solid construction. For this also contributes the fixation of the back battery cover in the upper part, above the camera lens. Practically, you won't feel any creak in the first few days. However, in a while, the back cover loosens a little. That's why you won't avoid the millimeter deflection from the primary position. However you won't even notice this in case you don't examine your phone more carefully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Size comparison ? side view ? it's very comfortable in hands ? back side</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A silver midget<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major part of the phone surface is made of silver metal. However, the layer is thin enough, so don't be afraid that your phone will chill your hand during using. The fingerprints on the metal surface won't trouble you, whereas the display is something else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the slightest touch of a finger can be seen on the black display. In addition, the upper line of buttons is situated directly under the display, so, practically you won't have any chance to avoid the fingerprints. That's why at least a small cloth for display cleaning in the sales package won't be unnecessary at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whereas the most outstanding element of the front cover is the above-mentioned display, the back part is dominated by the camera lens on the top and the loud speaker grid in the lower part. Even here I can't praise the designers too much. In case that the phone is lying on a soft surface, which has the ability to absorb the sound, the ringing or the alert of an incoming message is practically muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Details from different angles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional operating elements can be found on the side parts of the phone. There is a camera button on the right side, just above it is the miniUSB connector, the charger slot and the data cable slot. On the opposite side, practically at the same height, are situated the so-called smart keys for launching the most frequently used items. You may freely change the applications assigned to those keys in the phone's settings. On the upper side you'll find a mechanism for removal of the back cover and an eyelet for a string.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Side view ? USB connector ? Smart key ? the mechanism for back cover removal</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover covers up the Li-Ion battery with 720 mAh capacity. According to the manufacturer's official specifications, the indicated battery lifetime is up to 380 hours stand-by and up to 350 minutes continuous talk time. When the phone hasn't been too heavy loaded, the battery life of the tested prototype was really excellent, so in such case I am willing to believe the indicated values. The charging status can be checked directly from the phone menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad: hard to SMS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The bulging buttons would unnecessarily spoil the effect of the otherwise perfectly thin phone. Motorola has chosen a plastic keypad for the L6 model. So, all the buttons are made of one tablet. The only item, which doesn't belong to this plastic bar, is a round button, placed in the middle part under the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The confirming centre of the round button is also the only bulging on top of everything else. All the other buttons are on the same level. Although the keys have defined press, accompanied by a "click" sound, the passionate SMS writers won't be pleased. You have to put on increased pressure, which, especially while writing messages, is very difficult for the fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of all numeric buttons is practically the same. The accept and reject calls buttons and the functional buttons are bigger, located just under the display. You may set the left and right buttons' functionality in the phone settings. In most cases the middle functional button takes you into the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering that the middle range of buttons has been moved a few millimeters downwards and in addition, the buttons are separated one from another only by minimal gaps, it will take you some time, until you get used to write with your eyes closed. Moreover, you have to learn to distinguish the keys only by the miniature bulging numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software speed will cause you even more problems when writing rather than the keypad. L6 deals with the shorter messages without any problems, but as soon as the number of characters increases, the message editor is getting slow. The process of slowing down affects not only the message editor, but the software in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though I have complained about the pretty flat keypad, I must praise without hesitations its backlight. The keypad lights are shining with very pleasant light blue color. The gaps amongst the buttons are most lighted up. The numbers themselves and the symbols on the buttons are not forgotten as well. The illumination level is regulated by a sensor, which also automatically switches it on or off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: the weakest link<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A long time was spent on discussing, that the one of the main stones of success for the L6 will be its top display. The results, however, didn't reach the expectations, so the Motorola got the "ancient" passive CSTN display, capable of displaying maximum 65K colors. The colors on the display are rather dim and you'd better forget about the authentic colors of the photos taken by the built-in camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The switched off display seems to be very big at first sight. Pressing a button reveals that there is a rim around the display itself, which enlarges it optically. The real dimensions of the display are 28 x 35 mm with resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. The icons and letters in the rounded parts are rough due to the low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display in daylight... ? ...and in dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the operator logo, the signal strength indicator, the battery charging indicator and other status icons, you'll also find the current date and time on the main display. All the data is displayed on turned off display, but due to the used passive technology nothing can be seen just by glance. So, I don't understand why Motorola hasn't turned off its display fully in order to save a few percents from the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Different themes ? color style settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the style of T-Mobile, the main menu is arranged like a list of items or like a matrix of nine simple animated icons in 3 x 3 layout. You won't very much enjoy the animations due to the pale colors. The submenus are organized either according to the main menu setting or like a simple list of items without icons' displaying. You may select between several menus' color styles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two possibilities of the menu interface ? different color styles</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook by brand standard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having in mind the price the phone can be bought for, the phonebook is the best, which Motorola could add to its model. The maximum capacity of the phonebook is up to 1000 items plus the capacity of the SIM card, because the list can display the contacts, stored in the SIM card and in the phone simultaneously. Additional information can be assigned to every contact - nickname, phone type, category, address, birthday or some extra phone numbers or e-mail addresses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For simplified orientation in the contacts are also determined those fields - voice record, fast dialing, caller ID, picture caller ID. Aside from the personal ringing tone and picture, you may assign also a vibration type to every contact when the discrete mode is on. It's possible to use not only a standard ringtone, but your own track as well (MP3s, for example), which you have already recieved from a computer or another device via the wireless Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Contact list ? details ? entry editing ? entry details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The searching method in the phonebook is according to the first character, which is a pity. Nevertheless, the Razr V3 has demonstrated that this disadvantage doesn't annoy in no way so far. Having in mind the menu potential, a slight relief could be the fact that the searching method is quite agile after all. In addition you may use the second searching method - by entering a few initial characters, the phone jumps on the closest found name. This however is not a gradual searching method.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As I have already mentioned while describing the keypad construction, one of the phone's big weaknesses is the software speed. The slow reactions become most evident exactly at faster message writing. The letters are getting slow when writing and in case you are not pretty familiar with the dictionary or the number of presses of a given key, you'll have to put on considerable efforts to write faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six lines available for writing and reading text messages. Motorola L6 includes a predictive text writing application, the iTap Dictionary. The dictionary can be turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Selecting message type ? SMS test ? MMS test ? inserting an object</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports long text messages, of course. A message may contain maximum 3 parts, consequently 450 characters. While the written characters are counted down in the right upper corner, you have to figure out how many parts you have written by yourself. I have to mention the delivery reports receipt. Although Motorola L6 supports delivery reports, they are turned off by default, so you'll have to turn them on manually at every outgoing SMS or MMS. An automatic delivery report can not be activated even in the phone's settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor seems to be relatively simple. At closer examination you will find out that it supports all standard elements for creating MMS. It successfully inserts not only text and pictures, but sound and video records as well. There is no email in this model.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A little photographer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lens of the integrated VGA camera is mounted in the upper part of the back cover. This time you'll be looking for a self-portrait mirror or flashing diodes without success. There is a border after the lens circle, on which can be found more detailed information about the camera. The maximum picture resolution is 640 x 480 pixels (0.31 megapixel). In addition you may use a 4x digital zoom. The zoom, of course, produces only photo "crops".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Camera launch button ? lens details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated camera can be used maximum at multimedia messages creation. The resolution of 640 x 480 pixels is too insufficient for common photography. Moreover, the pictures have very bad quality. If you look carefully at them, you'll find out that the margins, especially the right one, are blurred. In addition, it appears to me that on most of the pictures, the middle part is kind of reddish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the zoom option and the manual setting of the exposure, the camera menu also proposes an option for using some special photo effects. So, the pictures can be viewed in, let's say, white-color combination, in sepia tones and others. Motorola L6 can also record short videos. In this case you may use the same visual effects. Video records are stored in 3GP format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Dealing with the photos ? video settingso camera interface ? video interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no data cable supplied in the box, that's why you have to make it with the wireless transfer via Bluetooth. Happily, sending files to PC is functioning without any problems trough the Copy function in the menu. I have faced small issues while using the original Bluetooth drivers for Windows XP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample pictures, taken by the built-in camera</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not enough memory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports ringtones in MP3 format. What is the situation with listening to music? You can't use the phone as a MP3 player, because of the non expandable memory size of 10.6 MB. Moreover, there are no basic functions, such as playlists creation or volume control. Otherwise, Motorola L6 can deal with basic ID3 tags. The absence of the option to use the phone as a MP3 player is a pity, because the music reproduction through the built-in speakers is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in calendar is very interesting. A month's timetable is chosen as a starting image in the calendar. There is an option to switch to a weekly or daily plan for a detailed view. You may modify the initial working hours in a way which suits best to your daily regime. An interesting function is the option to print your monthly or weekly timetable directly via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;A weekly view ? a monthly view ? event/ task details ? a daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application allows you to set several specific times, independent one from another. You may assign a separate ringtone to every set alarm clock. Ringing volume and a short notice definition are also available. There is also a simple calculator, combined with a currency converter, among the other organiser functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer has added two Java games for entertainment. The first one is a variation of the famous computer game Worms. The second one takes you into a space gunfight. A Multimedia Album application, dealing with the stored in the phone multimedia files, is pre-installed as a bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Alarm clock settings ? calculator ? screenshots of the built-in games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just before the Motorola L6 release, it was widely speculated about the EDGE technology as a standard part of the phone's equipment. Finally, "only" GPRS class 10 is available. You may connect the phone to a computer either via Bluetooth or via serial cable. This one however is not a part of the sales package, so you have to buy it separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It won't daze, it won't amaze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L6 won't be a market hit for sure. But it will find its users anyway. These, however, would be rather people, for whom the mobile phone serves mainly for calling and who want to "break free" from the stereotype of a stylish phone with reasonably above standard features. Another attractive aspect is certainly its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strong competitors of the Motorola L6 in this price range will be mainly Sony Ericsson K700 and Panasonic X700. Sony Ericsson could gain the users' hearts by its traditionally excellent menu, the sufficient memory capacity and the built-in radio. As for the Panasonic, contrary - due to the support of the miniSD memory cards and the Symbian S60 OS.</paragraph>
