			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a numbered few launch events in the year to count down the days to, and Samsung's Notes have long booked themselves a prominent spot on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung were the first to cross a line many thought would never be crossed. Of course, an onslaught of phablets was to inevitably follow - but not as soon perhaps as Samsung themselves must've thought. The original Galaxy Note was a shocker back in 2011 with a Super AMOLED HD display of the then whopping 5.3" diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether it was shock, surprise or disbelief, the competition didn't bother with a retaliation plan. Oh well, now everyone wants in on the phablet game, and there are even gadgets lately that have Note-killer written all across a bigger screen, better camera or a waterproof body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it may as well be Samsung's turn to act like they're not impressed. The Galaxy Note 3 made its scheduled splash at IFA, boasting a bigger display of more than double the resolution, the latest processing muscle, the groundbreaking 3GB of RAM, and all that within a tighter, thinner body.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung didn't step out of their comfort zone in terms of screen size - and this has been stretched beyond belief by competitors rushing to make up for lost time. Instead of going for the latest in imaging and waterproofing, focus is on what the Note is all about - bringing the smartphone experience on a bigger canvas, and a pen to make good use thereof. This time the Note isn't only about scribbling over screenshots and taking memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the S Pen is pulled out, the Air Command appears on screen to give you options to draw and doodle around, but also place apps (more than one) on parts of the screen while you're browsing the app drawer, homescreen, browser, etc. The S Pen is now a genuine multitasking tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the rest of the smartphone prowess goes, the Galaxy Note 3 has what it takes to call itself the new Samsung flagship. The device offers an improved camera, the screen carries all the positives of Super AMOLED and the processor is the best to have powered a droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a lot of ground to cover with the Galaxy Note 3 and the design and build is where we'll start. Follow us after the break for the whole story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Disclaimer: The following preview is based on a pre-production Galaxy Note 3 and by explicit request by Samsung we won't be posting any benchmark scores and evaluation of the Snapdragon 800's scores. We won't be conducting our usual suite of tests either. We'll leave those for a later occasion when we get a retail review sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes in a more refined finish than last year's Note. The edges are more rectangular while the body has almost entirely lost its gloss and has gone for a soft-touch, almost rubberized finish that emulates leather glance suggesting the Note 3 is a digital moleskine of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy Note II the Note 3 has slimmed down and the height and width of the device is virtually the same, despite the screen size increase. It also helps that the new Note 3 is over a millimeter thinner than the previous Note (8.3mm vs. 9.4mm) and it's lighter too - 168g (down from 183g). We've handled phones that weigh more than this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic around the screen is matte and has a brushed metal texture to it and comes in the standard Jet Black, Classic White and Blush Pink colors (don't worry, if you want more hues there are a ton of back covers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of the Note 3 is plastic even if most of it doesn't feel like it. The sides have what looks like a grooved metal strip, but that's plastic too. The grooves are not only an attractive design element, but they also positively improve the hand grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.7" display you'll find the earpiece, a 2 MP front-facing camera capable of 1080p video recording, the proximity sensor, ambient light sensor and the motion sensor, which is responsible for all the air gestures (aside from the Quick Glance overview, which relies on the proximity sensor).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display we find the typical Samsung three button layout consisting of a physical home button and a back and menu side buttons, which are capacitive. As usual the home button has an aluminum accent that surrounds it and adds a nice classy look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Galaxy Note 3 are nothing out of the ordinary in terms of controls. There's the rudimentary power unlock button on the right hand side on which the thumb nicely rests and the volume rocker on the left. The volume rocker could have been lowered a little bit so as to be more easily accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 is the first mobile device to feature USB 3.0 using the micro version of the port. The connection consists of two parts - one that is backwards compatible with microUSB 2.0 and one that adds additional pins for faster data transfers. Also at the bottom is one of the mics, the loudspeaker grille and the S Pen housing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features another mic and the 3.5mm audio jack, plus the IR blaster that Samsung has been putting on some Galaxy devices this generation. The left side features the volume rocker and the right the power button with yet another mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen can be placed back into its holster in two ways - either top or bottom facing up but you can't quite insert it any way you like as Samsung claims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get to the back, which (and we're not exaggerating here) is a massive improvement over the Note II back. With the Galaxy Note 3, Samsung has stuck to using plastic again, but this time around it has a great-looking leather texture. Best of all it feels similar to actual leather rather than a tacky imitation, and the faux-stitching is a great touch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we like about the leather texture is that unlike the glossy hyperglazed plastic, it doesn't become a smudgy, slippery mess as soon as you touch the device. We hope Samsung releases such covers for the Galaxy S4 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pop off the back cover to reveal the 3,200mAh battery (we were hoping for a bigger bump in capacity) along with the microSIM and microSD card slots. The slots are stacked on top of each other like they were on the Galaxy Mega 6.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom slot holds the microSIM card, which is blocked by the battery, while the top slot is for the microSD card, which can be removed even with the battery in place. The Note 3 comes in 32GB and 64GB versions, but with a microSD card slot we doubt many people will go for the 64GB option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package consists of a microUSB 3.0 cable, a 2A A/C adapter and a 3.5 mm headphone set with volume controls and microphone. The box comes in a wooden-style finish just like the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 feels big in the hand but by no means too big or too heavy. If you're using a Note II (or even an original Note) you won't bat an eye at the size of the Note 3. It feels sturdy and well put-together despite its primarily plastic build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, one handed operation is almost impossible for people with small hands but for regular phablet users the Note 3 is just the right amount of big. Samsung has done a nice update to the S Pen as well, making it usable with the capacitive buttons so now you can navigate the Galaxy Note 3 simply using the stylus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the highlight feature alongside the S-pen support. So let's cover the technicalities - the diagonal has been bumped by 0.2" (from 5.5" to 5.7"), while the resolution is more than twice as high (1080 x 1920 vs 720 x 1280) resulting in a pixel density of 386 ppi, which effectively (for the first time in Note terms) passes the Retina 300 ppi threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display technology is, again, Super AMOLED but this time the matrix isn't RGB but PenTile, however at these insane ppi levels there's no visible pixelation whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The previous Note featured an RGB Super AMOLED display, meaning that the pixel arrangement featured the right amount of red, green and blue pixels. Being PenTile, the Note 3 has a pixel arrangement matching the one of the Samsung Galaxy S4 - green sub-pixels are twice as many as blue and red sub-pixels, which isn't going to be relevant unless you have a microscope on you. Which is exactly what we have here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display matrix compared to Note II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is among the best we've seen here at HQ. It has practically infinite contrast, impeccable viewing angles and colors that pop out of the frame like nothing else. Samsung has even made sure the wallpapers in place are able to accentuate the color saturation to the extreme, but we like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the excellent LCDs on top tier smartphones these days it's tough to match the Super AMOLED's amazing image representation and deep blacks. The innate lower reflectivity of the AMOLED panel reflects in better sunlight legibility but more on that a little later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, let's look at the numbers. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3, as we said, has a practically unlimited contrast ratio, since blacks are naturally deep and don't require individual pixels to light up - AMOLEDs light up only the parts of the screen that require any color beside black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy Note 3 isn't the brightest we've seen and it's inferior to the Galaxy S4 in this department. However in most cases you won't notice this in practice unless you pit the Note 3 side by side with an HTC One or iPhone 5. The numbers of the Note 3 are also consistent with its predecessor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz on the big canvas<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean - the latest release of the Google platform available at the moment - and a laundry list of new TouchWiz features. The Galaxy Note 3 combines the best of both worlds and while it seems familiar, there's plenty new below the surface - so much in fact that you'd need a couple of days just to get to know all the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface video to start you off, which also shows the new air and motion gestures in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which features the lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2.2, which we saw on the Galaxy S4. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose what effect to add to the unlocking. The options include Oil paint and watercolor, which blur the color on screen as if you were dragging a wet paint brush through the screen. You can also opt for the well-known ripple and light effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting on the lockscreen by hitting the edit button. You can type something else, choose a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen that shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual and hasn't seen any changes. At the top there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the expand button, which reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 22 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can remove this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same if you're coming from a Galaxy S4. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changer really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. You can also disable apps straight from the App drawer, which is a good feature because they won't take any RAM or appear unwanted in the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 comes with Multi-window which now allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Chrome windows next to each other. There is also dedicated shortcut that lets you switch the places of the two opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff from one of the opened apps to the other is now available and is done in just three taps. It's a definite improvement and something the multi-window feature needed badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the way. It's a feature that will be used really often and we are happy to see Samsung extending its support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. Despite pilling feature upon feature, the end result does not feel cluttered and intuitive and well organized. Placing widgets, rearranging menu and homescreen panes, getting to your important settings, etc. is now faster than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also very responsive, thanks to the superb hardware inside. But there are further improvements coming after the break so bear with us.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Pen, Air and Motion gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition works impressively fast and accurately and will handle the rest for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to...well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 3 with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It automatically pops up once you hover with your S-Pen over a text field so you can enter handwritten text. In case something goes wrong, or the device does not activate the Pen Window for you, just use this shortcut to the handwriting service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video showing how these new Air Commands work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note is an application that allows you to create and customize notebooks. There is a total of 9 preset notebooks to choose from but you can also create your own custom look from images in your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you're done with creating a notebook you can go ahead and fill it in with notes, drawings, images on which you can draw or doodle, etc. The app gives you a nice little preview of the notes inside a notebook when you swipe it down in the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside a note you can choose from a variety of pens and brushes, adjust the color and thickness of the line, insert text in a number of fonts, make the text bold or italic, etc. You can create custom shapes, have an undo and redo option and choose to delete whole lines or just parts of the content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can insert just about anything into a note - voice memos, images, video, charts or illustrations, maps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook lets you keep any content you browser through on the Note 3's screen. You need to select anything on the screen of the Note 3 by pressing the S Pen button and the software highlights it and gives you a prompt to send it to Scrapbook via an image. Air Command also gives you a shortcut to Scrapbook and lets you highlight anything on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scribble notes to a scrapped image, add tags, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you import images from your phone or SD card storage and sync with your Samsung account but to our disappointment won't let you sync your scraps and tags to Evernote, Springpad, Google Keep, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a number of advanced features enabled by the powerful hardware and dedicated sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. Just like before when you're hovering the S Pen or finger over text or image, email, the software responds and brings you a larger pop up version of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is called information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on). It also works for previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, it also works for the checking out the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (works with previous button too), it works for previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers or the S Pen around 3cm away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another set of "air" features are the Air Gestures. Quick Glance is one of them, but there's more. The rest of the air commands are triggered by waving your hand over the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use waving to scroll web pages in the browser (vertical waves), switch between tabs (horizontal waves), move between tracks in the music player and photos in the gallery, accept a call and move app shortcuts and S Planner events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air Gestures can detect your hand up to 7cm (just under 3") and might prove useful in some situations. Note that only the native apps support them, third party apps will not work with them (even Chrome that comes preinstalled on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is one of the two new features - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get it right the first time, but after that you can tilt your head down to scroll down and up to scroll back up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second new feature is simpler and more useful - Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a number of motion gestures, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact whose info you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is present on the Galaxy Note 3. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Note 3 to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The only problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy Note 3 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera is top notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We decided to add some samples captured with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3's camera. To start off the Galaxy Note 3 has a 13 MP camera capable of 4128 x 3096 stills in the native 4:3 aspect ratio. It's supported by a powerful LED flash to aid it in low light conditions and has many software additions like Dual shot, Panorama, Rich Tone (that's HDR in layman's terms), touch focus, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3's camera sensor probably derives from the Galaxy S4 and we're happy to say carries the latter's excellent image quality entirely. Images come out very sharp with great levels of detail, low noise, superb contrast and generally look great. We won't be diving too much into the quality as we save that for the full review but even with this prototype we doubt image quality would get any sweeter than it already is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR stills come out great as well. Samsung manages to squeeze detail out of every shadow by exposing every area in the scene but the end result doesn't have that over-exposed, over-sharpened, too unrealistic look. Images have pleasant detail, the sky is nicely accentuated and adds a solid dramatic look to images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for video, the Snapdragon 800-powered Galaxy Note 3 is capable of not only 1080p FullHD capture but also 2160p 4K video. It takes up a lot of space on the device, naturally, but also carries the very high bitrate of around 47 Mbps with a constant framerate of 29 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio has a bitrate of 121 Kbps with two channels (stereo) and a sampling rate of 48 Khz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a 1080p FullHD sample. It has a bitrate of 17 Mbps and a 30 fps framerate. Audio is recorded in stereo with a bitrate of 127 Kbps and a sampling rate of 48 Khz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Spotless audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 showed exceptionally clean audio output in our audio quality test. The phablet posted some of the best scores we have seen in both parts of the test and garnished them with decent volume levels. It's not the loudest we have seen, but it's loud enough for 99% of the occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively, there's virtually no distortion when you plug in a pair of headphones. Except for the minor bump in stereo crosstalk the output is barely affected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the phablet flagship for this year and the upcoming holiday season. Samsung made sure of it and despite having many opponents to shuffle through before it can get the user's seal of approval, the Galaxy Note 3 does offer something the competition just doesn't - the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want a high-end and high-res canvas on which to indulge your digital drawing and writing needs, while still managing to make phone calls and take pictures, then the Galaxy Note 3 is the only device to turn to. That's not to say LG, Huawei, Sony and the rest of the major makers don't put up a good fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 faces some elite competition from LG. Starting with the Optimus G Pro, which rocked the phablet world for a while with a 5.5" FullHD LCD of 401 ppi, a Snapdragon 600 processor and capable software and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was twice as fast as the then current Samsung Galaxy Note II, had twice the resolution and it is still a pretty capable smartphone to this day, not to mention its price has already settled down to more accessible levels. The G Pro, however, doesn't even attempt to touch the Note's S Pen capabilities, it has a smaller screen and can't hope to match the Snapdragon 800 inside the Note 3 in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro E985</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes the Sony Xperia Z Ultra. It's razor thin, it's got a bigger 6.4" display of FullHD resolution, the ppi is still in Retina territory, the Snapdragon 800 is once again the star of the show and unlike the Note 3, you can take the Z Ultra with you when you go skinny dipping. However the Snapdragon 800-powered phablet omits the active stylus support, it doesn't have that fancy 2160p video recording and it is much heavier and cumbersome than the Note 3, all the while bringing a smaller battery, which is just shameful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First thought to be nothing but a gimmick, a relic from days bygone, the S Pen is now the center of attention on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. That and the overwhelmingly huge display fitted into what seems to be a still pocketable body. We gotta admit, we've got team members here, who are huge fans of the active stylus input and now that we've had the time to properly get to know all of the new Note 3 features, we can help but want some more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time around however, we only had a pre-production unit for this preview. We certainly hope to experience more of the Note 3 and see how it fares in departments we didn't even touch upon this time. And from our early look, we have a really solid feeling that the Note 3 might just turn to be the phablet to beat this autumn.</paragraph>
