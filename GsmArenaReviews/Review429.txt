			<paragraph>Our team has had the opportunity to evaluate all six new models from Sony Ericsson - 3 megapixel camera phones, a new clamshell and its music-orientated twin; the successor of the famous Sony Ericsson K700 and the cheapest Sony Ericsson camera phone. More than a hundred of live pictures for you in this review only!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have been given the chance to test the hottest Sony Ericsson products soon after their worldwide presentation. We were eager to see them more than ever before for two basic reasons: Sony Ericsson launched not one, but six new models; the best among them feature particularly fascinating parameters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's no fashion model<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>My first encounter with this phone was marked by a certain feeling of disappointment as to its design. In all official pictures the phone looked like a square box totally blank of ideas. Seen in reality it gives the same impression. Once I had taken a closer look at its construction, however, I kind of started to change my opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Edgy, rigorous, Sony Ericsson</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Comparison between the new model and Sony Ericsson D750</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front cover of the device is fully purpose-built. Enough space has been assigned for both the keypad and the display. The front side does not feature decorative elements because of simple lack of space. There are silver bands on the phone sides, you will not find any edge rounding on its rear cover also. The entire look of Sony Ericsson K800 is fully determined by the expectations of the end user, that is to say, customers tend to see their phones as electric devices meant to serve for both work and fun, but in no way do they look as a fashion accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sides are decorated with silver bands ? memory card slot and music player button ? volume keys and the camera release button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K800 is a little bit bigger than its forerunner K750. What I cannot get accustomed to is the bulging camera area on the back of the device. In fact, it's not a real obstacle to functionality it is just an impression of mine caused by the unusual angle, under which the phone lays on a surface. Pay attention to the fact that the camera cover may move accidentally if you carry the phone in your pocket. The phone is made of matt black plastics, due to which fingerprints remain relatively invisible. Yet, the cover glass of the display and the glossy cover of the camera do need to be wiped from time to time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the K750 model, where the cover would move lengthwise, in Sony Ericsson K800 it moves crosswise</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;A few interesting details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have no special remarks to make as to the qualities of the keypad and the joystick. Keys are all big enough. Marked by strong gaps, they are also easy to recognize by touch. Each press is followed by a quiet click sound. There is plenty of space for one's thumb to be comfortably held against the edge of the joystick. The pad of the joystick is large enough to ensure a reliable press likewise. All in all, the tiny functional buttons squeezed between the two main functional keys seem to be the only minor drawback as pressing them requires certain concentration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp; Both keypad and joystick are brilliant</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music button is located on the left side of the phone. It is quite small and a bit too embedded. On the opposite side there is a pair of buttons, which could have been designed slightly bigger too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's get used to Cyber-shot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the press conference we have been informed that the manufacturer of Cyber-shot cameras is going to launch a campaign as huge as the one of Walkman. This famous mark of Sony digital cameras will be used as a brand for the production of the best camera phones ever. Btw, this is exactly the story of Walkman being a sheltering brand for the best music phones on the current market. Yet, all those dreaming of a Cyber-shot Walkman please do not get pretty excited as no such "perfect" device is currently being developed. In fact, Cyber-shot will be more or less a different type of a Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera cover is not very stable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To activate the camera simply slide its cover aside. I was eager to see the new graphic camera interface so hugely advertised during Sony Ericsson's launching campaign, but eventually I did not observe any crucial difference between the new model and Sony Ericsson K750. Even though users are offered far more setting options than in any other camer phone, Sony Ericsson K800 still lacks scene modes or manual exposure settings (both being common features of standard digital cameras).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking pictures with Sony Ericsson K800 ? camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder in Sony Ericsson K800 opens a fascinating view, mainly due to the qualities of the display. Pictures in full resolution are taken surprisingly fast. Focusing is almost instant, as well. In addition, the camera features an interesting function called BestPic, which first allows the user to take 9 pictures in full resolution within a mere second and consequently lets them choose which one they like best. Once the preferred picture has been selected, the rest get deleted automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is also equipped with a xenon flash, whose performance is unexpectedly good. Alike any common digital camera, it is able to lighten a darker scene at the considerable distance of several meters. Manufacturer's representatives did their best to assure us that this flash light is extremely energy-friendly. However, it has one important drawback when compared to standard LEDs - it works in a stroboscopic mode only and therefore can hardly be used as an emergency lamp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery, in which ready pictures can be browsed, is new too. It is organized in the form of a chronologically ordered album. Pictures are filed into folders by date. The full-screen view option is present, of course. I apologize for not being able to offer you sample photos taken with Sony Ericsson K800. Seeing that the presented testing models only featured temporary firmware I did not have the opportunity to send pictures through Bluetooth, unfortunately. So sample photos are still to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; New photo album</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let me mention one more thing regarding blogs. The original idea of the manufacturer was not that the user would send pictures to their friends' mobile phone, but that they would rather display those pictures in internet, where everybody would be able to view them in full resolution. Instead, friends would receive a standard SMS with an internet address.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extensive phonebook and repeated events, great!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with an MP3 player that is identical to the players used in all other Walkman models. In other words, files are once again sorted by artist and album name. The phone comes with a pair of standard earphones and 64MB of internal memory. If you need an additional memory card, you will have to buy it separately as no such one is delivered in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;MP3 player's orange background is expected to disappear from the final version of this phone, as orange is a patent of Walkman models only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports Bluetooth 2.0 and is therefore able to broadcast stereophonic sound signal through a pair of wireless earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the menu was a delightful experience. The fine resolution of the display presents a truly breathtaking picture, which Sony Ericsson has underlined with tiny animations, as usual. The main menu consists of 12 nicely elaborated icons. Extensive menus mainly consist of text. Tabs can often be seen too. I was pleased by the instance, with which keys would react to my press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main menu ? extensive text menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Color scheme is different</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The novelties in Sony Ericsson K800, when compared to the current K750 model, can hardly be seen at a first look. Yet they are crucial. First, the capacity of the phonebook has been extended to 1000 contacts and 2500 numbers. Repeated events in the phonebook are another pleasant surprise. The model we tested permitted us to set up a day repetition only, but the final firmware is supposed to offer a more varied setup options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here comes the proof: info statement about the phonebook memory ? a record of repeated reminder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following readers' requests I made an attempt to search for an Office documents viewer in the extras menu, but I did not succeed. Present official representatives were not able to tell me, whether such a viewer would appear in the final model for a certainty, either. By all means, there is no doubt that this phone will manage to run several extra java applications at a time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The same old road<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K800/K790 gives me more or less the same impression like the one the forerunner K750 left in me a year ago. By now it is already as clear as daylight that this new multimedia device is going to be successful. The reasons are numerous: it serves both for work and fun, it offers intuitive control as well as all modern mobile functions all in a stretch. What's more, its price is quite reasonable - approximately 430 euro. Sony Ericsson will hit the market this summer. No exact date has been officially stated yet.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K310 comes to substitute the K300 model. Once again it is a cheap multifunctional mobile phone with a built-in camera and MP3 ringing melodies. It features a bigger and better looking display than its forerunner, even if still passive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad constitutes of three columns of bulgy keys. Its functional part has been replaced by a joystick and four standard functional keys. Control is standard and easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Small size and low weight are perhaps two of the main qualities of Sony Ericsson K310. Yet, will they measure up in a combination with phone's drab design? I myself believe that a little bit of aesthetic touch would have had a positive impact on phone's general outlook and would have helped it stand out among its competitors. The good thing is that this is the cheapest Sony Ericsson phone with camera. Its introductory price is about 130 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson representatives would speak about the K510 model as of the successor of the much-favored Sony Ericsson K700. It seems, however, that in certain aspects the veteran is going to hold the precedence. One of them is the display as the coming K510 is going to offer a picture in a resolution of scant 128 x 160 pixels. The difference is visible at first sight. The built-in radio in Sony Ericsson K700 is another feature that speaks in favor of the old model as the radio application is missing in the new model. On the other hand, Sony Ericsson K510 comes to excel with a full-function megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alike the phones described above, Sony Ericsson K510 lacks any aesthetic decorations. Its keypad is composed of tiny separated keys dominated by a joystick, which is the main control element of the device. The phone is comfortable to work with despite of the fact that its keys are somewhat rigid. I remained open-mouthed when I registered the phonebook capacity of this new toy - it fits in up to 1000 names. To enjoy it, however, make sure you have 200 euros to invest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson new clamshell models were the attraction of the entire official presentation. This was especially true in the case of Walkman W300, which represents an elegant combination of black and silver shades and a juicy orange logo incrusted into dotted bedding in the bottom part of the phone's cover. Compared to the rigorous curves of the new models of classic construction, the look of Walkman W300 is truly a festival for the eye. The robust design of phone's joint is probably the only part I did not happen to like much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of the internal display is pretty good. Yet, a bit higher resolution would have made it even better. The external monochromatic display is noted for its brilliant legibility. Besides, it shows details about the music file that is being currently played. Thanks to the qualities of the external display and the side special control buttons, the music player can be controlled without the need of opening the device. The side orange buttons not only control volume levels, but also stop music or switch from one file to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from this, the music player is more or less identical to those used in other Walkman models of Sony Ericsson. Music files are ordered by artists' and albums' names. An offline mode is available too. If you leave the real phone part of the device deactivated, then you can enjoy 30 hours of music. Under the phone's cover there is a memory card, which supplies the device with the space it needs. This comes to say that if you are to exchange memory cards it will be necessary to first remove the cover. In all cases, the battery remains in its place, so there is no need to switch off the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W300's keypad has also received special attention from the company's designers. Keys are organized in columns, which are pretty difficult to distinguish without sight control. Never the less, keypad control is generally comfortable. A round navigation key accompanied by a square of functional keys is Walkman W300's basic control element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>New Walkman's introductory price is 230 euros, including a pair of top-quality earphones and a 256MB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to save approximately 60 euros, get yourself a Sony Ericsson Z530 instead of the new clamshell Walkman. These phones are almost identical, with covers, music equipment and EDGE support being the only elements that differ them one from another.</paragraph>
