		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After numerous leaks and a name change prior to entering officialdom, the slide-out QWERTY sporting Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G has made its way to the US market, aiming for users with a heavy knack for messaging. The epically named distant relative of the legendary I9000 follows the footsteps of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, which we took for a spin earlier this year, but adds a hardware QWERTY and updated internals to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specifications of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G are a curious mix of some of the iconic tech features released in the past two years. The smartphone's 4" Super AMOLED display and 5MP main camera can be traced directly to the original Galaxy S, while its dual-core Snapdragon S4 chipset is featured in none other but the hot selling Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of talents, which the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The presence of a hardware QWERTY in the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is a dream come true for many users out there. It was only a few months back when we thought that this category of Android smartphones is on its way out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 silicon and the Samsung adorned Android Ice Cream Sandwich - they have already proven to be a sweet combination in the Samsung Galaxy S III. The same goes for T-Mobile's speedy 42Mbps HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't say the same about the camera and screen of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G. Both units, while perfectly functional, are hardly befitting of the handset's other internals, as well as its price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we'll kick things off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G for T-Mobile is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail package won't blow you away<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is hardly what dreams are made of. Inside it, you will find a microUSB cable and a charger - nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Headphones have slowly, but surely made it out of the retail boxes of US market smartphones. You will have to get a pair of those on your own dime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's face it: the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G will surely not win any beauty contests. The smartphone is hardly any different than a number of 2011 Samsung offerings, save for the presence of a hardware home button below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is good. The Galaxy S Relay 4G is mostly made of high quality plastic with some metal bits present as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware keyboard of the smartphone is not an unfamiliar sight. It is similar to the unit found in the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G from a couple of years back. The five-row QWERTY keyboard offers well-spaced buttons, which feel sturdy built, and ready to take plenty of abuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's measures are 126 x 66 x 13.5 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 147 grams. For a QWERTY device, the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G certainly belongs on the elegant side of the scale, thanks to its plastic costruction and modestly sized 4" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4" Super AMOLED display with WVGA resolution is a familiar sight - it has been featured in numerous Samsung smartphones this far, and will likely find home in future ones as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, its PenTile matrix and relatively low pixel density are beginning to show their age. We don't believe they are a good fit for a device in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you will find the earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, the front-facing camera, as well as the notification light. Below the screen you will find the homescreen button at the center, flanked by two capacitive ones on its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left side of the device. It is also where the QWERTY keyboard opens from. The power/lock key is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a 3.5mm audio jack on top, as well as a latch for removing the battery cover. The mouthpiece and microUSB port are located on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top part of the back of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G, you will find the 5MP camera and LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is located at a light hump on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the device's back cover. The regular sized SIM card is under the battery. The microSD card is hot swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1800mAh battery of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G did a fantastic job in our traditional endurance test. It got the device an endurance rating of 49 hours. This means that you will need to recharge your smartphone every two days if you use it for an hour each for telephony, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is an easy task. The back cover has a grippy texture, which makes accidental drops unlikely. One handed operation is possible with the hardware QWERTY staying in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is hardly the best looking smartphone out there, it makes up for it with a solid build and impressive battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software tricks up the smartphone's sleeve.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, which has been heavily modified by the latest TouchWiz UI from Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a look at the smartphone in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock". Four customizable shortcuts are available at the bottom of the screen - drag one up to activate the specific app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one final cool but not so useful trick - you wake the phone (tap the power button or the home key), then press and hold the screen and rotate the phone horizontally. It will unlock and start the camera as soon as it's in the right orientation to snap a photo. We found that it's quicker to just keep a Camera shortcut on the lockscreen and use that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you make it past the lockscreen, you'll notice that the dock at the bottom of the screen fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other four to any shortcut you like or even a folder full of shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - add, delete (but you can't have more than seven) or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the notification area - you get Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, and five more toggles just off screen. You can scroll them sideways to reveal more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following the ICS convention, the app drawer has a tab that lets you pull out widgets to the homescreen easily. Unlike stock ICS though, you cannot move between tabs by swiping through the pages - you have to explicitly hit the tab. Some will find this more logical as scrolling past the available apps to get to the widgets takes some getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has a zoomed-out overview too that lets you rearrange pages, but you can't create empty ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap to uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes - Customizable grid (where you can rearrange icons freely), Alphabetical grid (if you think you can find apps quicker if their alphabetized) and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's an ICS-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a button at the bottom of the list to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager. This is the quickest way to clear up both the list and some RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back to the homescreen and the widgets. Ice Cream Sandwich comes with various widgets and Samsung have added more still. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is now available natively in ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To resize a widget, you tap and hold on it as if you're going to move it but after the phone vibrates, you lift your finger. Four handles appear that let you resize the widget in every direction. How much you can stretch/squeeze a widget depends on the widget itself - it will glow red if you've moved beyond the supported size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live wallpapers are a great way to prettify your homescreen. Photo wall for example creates a collage of photos from your Gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You've probably seen our S Voice vs. Siri vs. Speaktoit Assitant post, but we'll recap our impressions of Samsung's S Voice here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice understands English, French, Spanish and Korean, Italian and German. It can be activated by voice too - the default prompts are "Hi Galaxy" and "Hi Buddy", and you can add custom ones too. That makes for completely hands-free, voice-only control of the phone. Note that this puts a strain on the battery, but there's an option to activate this feature only when the phone is plugged into a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can do the usual - search the web, make calls, send texts (which Android natively supports and so does Vlingo), but you can also use it instead of the notification area toggles, to control the music player, look up weather and traffic info for a city, set timers and alarms (and snooze them too) or launch an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps get special treatment - for example, you can say "I want to take a picture" to activate the camera and say "Cheese!" to snap the photo. Facebook is another example - you can update your status using S Voice. Same goes for Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also a tool for quickly looking up facts - it's powered by Wolfram Alpha. It has an enormous database covering topics ranging from Culture and Media to Physics. Unlike Siri, S Voice extracts only the relevant bit of info that Alpha provides and showing you more details only if you want them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's S Voice in action, up against Siri and a free digital assistant from the Play Store:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things that made a negative impression was that the speech to text transcription was somewhat worse than Siri (which isn't perfect either). S Voice understood the commands most of the time, though there were cases when it didn't quite catch our words correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice also needs some polishing when it comes to removing unnecessary prompts - it asked for GPS to be active when checking the traffic in a city (even though we weren't in that city and it shouldn't matter where we are anyway), it stumbled when there were multiple numbers that an SMS can be sent to (it reverted to regular touchscreen interaction, forgetting we're trying to talk to it) and then it crashed when we tried a question just for fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if you look past its quirks, S Voice can be a handy tool in situations where your hands are occupied (especially while driving, when you can't take your eyes off the road either). In all other scenarios you will be much better off using your fingers than your voice. Things might improve in the future but we are still a few years away before such technology becomes an essential part of the smartphone user experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset on board, we expected the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G to be no slouch, and rightfully so. Thanks to the smaller amount of pixels its GPU had to deal with, the device posted impressive benchmark scores, which often bested the current crop of top shelf Android smartphones. Only the HTML based benchmarks proved to be more of a challenge for the smartphone. Here go the scores.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. The four tabs on top are still present, albeit slightly redesigned, and provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text message (left swipe).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap on the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. In Ice Cream Sandwich fashion it shows only two tabs. The first one is the About tab, which shows the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap on the top left corner, just like in vanilla ICS. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there're a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature lets you choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been slightly redesigned and can be accessed through the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). Or "play" and off it goes. It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fully loaded messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger - as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use S Voice to dictate your message or use Google's built-in voice recognition software if you don't feel like typing. If the latter is often the case, Samsung provides the option to change the input methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there should you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will come in good use, however, is the new Direct call feature. When you are reading a message from someone, their number will be automatically dialed by just lifting the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts on the bottom of the screen are new email, search, labels, refresh and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Relay 4G also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text entry is handled by the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers big and comfortable keys. Of course, you have that hardware QWERTY at your service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G comes with the default ICS Gallery. It opens up in Albums view, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, photos are sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces visible in it, the Galaxy S Relay 4G will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize who is who automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G uses an updated version of the TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories, but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection. For example, if you highlight the upper part of the square the selected songs will be exciting and if your selection is centered around the lower right corner, the selected songs will be calm and joyful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Relay 4G player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have put what is easily the best default video player on the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G. It offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite - the visible video thumbnails (all eight of them) are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate, but it's an awesome preview and it shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature that showcases the power of the chipset is the chapter preview - it detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera from 2010<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G offers a rather old 5MP camera, which captures stills with 2592x1944 pixels resolution. It offers geotagging, touch focus, face and smile detection and digital image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is quite similar to what the Galaxy S III has. You get two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder - on the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - you can easily have all frequently used features just a tap away. The fifth shortcut always points to Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is capable of taking some surprisingly good photos. The produced shots show remarkably low levels of digital noise, high edge-to-edge sharpness and some good contrast and colors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording tops out at 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is able to record 720p videos, which is rather paltry, considering the price range it is in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left for up to five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p video footage has a high bitrate of 12Mbps and some high-quality 128kbps stereo audio. The framerate is smooth and the sharpness is high. Unfortunately, the handset made a rather poor judgment about exposure and the end result is a series of overexposed videos as you'll see by yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched 720p video clip from the Galaxy S Relay 4G for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera can take 720p videos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity ticks all the boxes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and quad-band 3G with HSPA+ (42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink). T-Mobile's network is quite possibly the best way to experience mobile data in a non-LTE fashion. The coverage in the New York City area is superb and so were the speeds we experienced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 for fast and energy-efficient local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support and a Wi-Fi hotspot option, carrier permitting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity is present as well. S Beam will help you make the most of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A good Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G has the hardware specs to propel it to great heights of user experience. The pretty large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer has almost everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In an unfortunate fashion, the Samsung Galaxy S Relay comes without an office editor preinstalled. You will have to spend your own dime in order to get one. Given the hardware QWERTY on board, we found the lack of productivity suite particularly odd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app also comes with a stopwatch and a timer. They are easy to work with and can come in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a YouTube app, which makes browsing YouTube videos from your subscriptions easier. Unfortunately, it cannot match the resolution the in-browser flash player can give you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Relay 4G comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The latest version features vector maps, which are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G adds a much desired hardware QWERTY keyboard to a package of specifications, which have been long tried and tested though not exactly in this combination. The dual-core Snapdragon S4 chipset is one of the leggiest around, while the TouchWiz-ed Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich has proven to be a great combination in the Galaxy S III flagship. We only wished T-Mobile would go easy on the preinstalled software - the application launcher of the Galaxy S Relay 4G had more magenta colored icons than we would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera caught us unprepared with its high quality stills. Photos came out with spectacularly low noise levels and were nicely sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's build quality is also good, though the looks could have been a lot better. The addition of the hardware home button is a welcome one, though we don't believe it improves the handset's ageing looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G is priced at $149.99 with a two-year commitment to T-Mobile. This is hardly an affordable price for a smartphone which has some of its main hardware components sourced from 2010's stock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully however, there aren't that many competitors to the device around. If you are willing to take a look however, here are some viable alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The $ 199.99 Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE for Sprint Wireless is the strongest competitor of the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G. It features a significantly better 4.3" qHD screen with ColorBoost technology and an 8MP camera unit. The laser cut keyboard of the Moto offers better experience too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not crazy about having the latest specifications on board, you must also take a look at the Motorola Droid 4 for Verizon Wireless. It will offer the same superb keyboard as the Photon Q, to go with an 8MP camera and Android 4.0 ICS. The Droid 4 is currently priced at $99, but we are confident that more discounts are on the way as it approaches a full year of market availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola DROID 4 XT894</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't feel like spending any money, look no further than the Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T. The Tegra 2 sporting handset offers better camera and lovely slide-out QWERTY with soft-feel buttons. It was recently updated to Android 4.0 ICS. You can snag one for a penny from AT&amp;T.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i927 Captivate Glide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, it is hard to call the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G the company's finest effort at the QWERTY theme. Given the relative lack of competition, combined with T-Mobile's traditionally large crowd of hardware keyboard lovers, the handset will likely sell well, with its buyers bound to pick one up with their thumbs, not their hearts.</paragraph>
