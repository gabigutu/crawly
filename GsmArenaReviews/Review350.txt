			<paragraph>The Samsung Z560 is a feature-packed clamshell which is equipped with some of the latest technologies in the mobile industry - HSDPA, a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus, microSD memory card slot and a really large 2.3" TFT display with a QVGA resolution. Although neither of these carries the "wow" factor seen in other mobiles, it certainly promises a real enjoyment of your mobile experience. Well, truth be told - it manages to live up to that promise and you are welcomed to read on our detailed review.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Well this year no one is talking about 3G anymore. The magic word is definitely HSDPA. The High-Speed Downlink Packet Access is a 3G mobile telephony protocol that comes as an upgrade to existing 3G networks and the current deployments of the technology allow for a downlink speed of 1.8 Mbit/s, 3.6 Mbit/s, and 7.2 Mbit/s. You can imagine what the increased bandwidth speed means - quicker downloads, streaming of mobile content with increased quality and finally, a wireless modem connection for your notebook wherever you go. Well, those are really nice prospects for the mobile industry and for us, the consumers in particular. We would see more and more of HSDPA-enabled handsets becoming commercially available and of course, more and more of those reviewed here at GSMArena.com. The Samsung Z560 is among those products. It is already available to markets worldwide as well as several other solutions by other manufacturers - such as the  Motorola RAZR V6 maxx which seems as almost identical to the Samsung solution.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Further on, the Samsung Z560 clamshell comes as an upgrade to the 3G Samsung Z540 which we reviewed almost a year ago. The successor has an updated camera, a new lighter design, a larger capacity battery, and the added benefit of a microSD memory card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Slim and wide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now the Samsung Z560 leaves an impression of a really slim handset while in the same time when the flip is closed it measures a good 16 mm of thickness. Besides being slim, it is most definitely one other thing - really wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the flip closed the central part of the outer panel is taken by the secondary display. It is a 65K colors TFT one with a resolution of 96 x 96 pixels. Below it are several touch-sensitive keys which come in good use when you use the Z560 as a MP3 player. Above it is the 2 megapixel camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Z560: front</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open the flip there is no way of not noticing how large the main display is. It is a 256K colors TFT one with a QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution and it measures a good 2.3" in diagonal. Above the display is the in-call speaker grill, while below it is the secondary camera used for video calls. The keypad is really nicely elaborated and besides the usual functional and alphanumeric keys it also has a dedicated shortcut key for video calls and a second one for a nice shortcut menu.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Z560 features a port for plugging the charger, headset or data cable. Beside the port is the dual volume key. The bottom and top part of the device are pretty bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Left side view: connectivity port and volume key ? bottom and top views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Right side view: memory card slot and camera shutter key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Z560 is bare too. The battery cover is removed with a slide. You can see the SIM card bed above the battery but in order to put in or take out the card you have to remove the battery first. The Z560 is equipped with a 900 mAh Li-Ion battery which according to the manufacturer should keep the device going for up to 320 hours in standby mode and up to 3 hours and 40 minutes of call time. In reality the battery lasted 2-3 days with moderate talk times of 10-15 minutes a day.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Generally, we were pleased with the ergonomics of the Z560. We did notice a flaw though and it concerns opening the clamshell single-handedly. On the left side of the Samsung Z560 there is a recess where you can rest your finger in order to open the flip. It works okay and you can open it with a relative ease. On the right side however there is no recess and opening the device with your left hand proves pretty much impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other that that we are pleased with the way the device feels when held in hand and due to its wide form-factor it is nice to talk on, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Touch sensitive can make you really touchy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The external display of the Samsung Z560 has a lower resolution as compared to the previous Z540 model (96 x 96 pixels against 128 x 128 pixels). Both models have dedicated music keys but in the Z560 they are touch sensitive. The external display is nice although it's on a medium level when it comes to legibility under direct sunlight. The touch sensitive keys proved a nice concept - they add that technology touch that may appeal to the wider audience. They have their own backlighting but instead on helping you use the player in the dark, the keys backlighting only flashes for a second when you touch them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    External display in the dark: standby screen and running the music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When compared to Motorola RAZR maxx V6, the external display of the Samsung Z560 scores less. The Motorola one has a resolution of 120 x 160 pixels plus it offers a basic menu to control the music player without even opening the flip. As it turned out though the Motorola maxx V6 has some problems with the touch sensitive keys too, so neither of the two has devised a flawless solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z560 main display though is really impressive. It's really large and the colors are very vivid. Even under direct sunlight, the display stays clear and legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z560 display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z560 keypad has an excellent white backlighting. The individual keys have a great tactile feedback and since the body of the handset is spacey enough, typing a message was a real joy. Typing mistakes are a rare thing when it comes to Samsung Z560 keypad.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Our first job when we test any clamshell is usually to check whether you can mute or reject a call without opening the device. This function is essential if you have set the active flip to answer your incoming calls. Now the case with the Samsung Z560 is that there is an option to mute or reject a call with the flip closed. You can use the side volume keys for that purpose. A possible bug in our test handset though allowed us only to mute an incoming call though. Rejecting it was impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that our hands-on experience proved that the Samsung Z560 deals well with making and receiving calls - nothing less than expected. The only downside to it is that if you make a longer call - let's say over 5 minutes - the whole body tends to heat up unpleasantly - a problem we've seen on other ultra slim devices both by Samsung and by other manufacturers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung old school style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Z560 has a standard Samsung user interface as seen on many other Samsung mobiles. The standby screen shows info on the clock and date, battery status, network signal and selected profile. The external display shows pretty much the same information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby screen on the main and secondary display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of a 3 x 4 grid. The sub-menus are shown in listed view only. There is even an Offline mode which allows you to use the Samsung Z560 as a music player or an organizer in places where the use of mobile phones is prohibited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu ? startup question</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, there are no graphic themes available. However, you may change the font size and the style of the digits when you enter a number. There are several options, some of which are quite interesting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Different dial digits styles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is the new shortcut menu which aims to allow a bit of multitasking when using the Samsung Z560. With it you can make a call, check your messages, open the web browser or close all open applications wherever you are in the menu system. This new menu allows the music player to be minimized.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well known phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in Z560 seems very simple and easy to use. The maximum capacity is 1000 contact names (much like the competing Motorola maxx V6) and it orders them either by first or by last name. However, when you search through them, it searches only by first or last name, in accordance to the order setting. You won't be able to search by a first name if you have set the phone to order the contacts by last name, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays up to 3 contact names en bloc. Only the default number of the contact is shown and in order to see the other numbers (if any) you should get into the contact's information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Phonebook list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact the phone offers many fields and you can add up to five different phone numbers. However, if you add a birthday date of a contact, it is not transferred to the calendar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The call records part of the phone is divided in four sub-folders. The "Current contacts" is where the recent dialed, received and missed calls are gathered. There are also the Missed calls, Dialed and Received calls folders. In all four folders there is an option which shows the amount of times you have called or received a call from the same contact. There is also a data counter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All types of messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor of the phone seems very practical and easy to use. It displays a counter of the characters left and starts the countdown from 1836 characters. It also shows the amount of separate messages that will be sent if you exceed 160 characters. Of course, there is a T9 dictionary to assist fast writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? typing a message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email messages cannot exceed the 1000 characters maximum capacity. There are two separate inboxes for the emails and the other messages. When you read a message it is displayed in 7 lines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Managing files and multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media player of the Samsung Z560 seems nice and has an interesting graphic visualization feature. The sound of the loud speakers is loud enough but unfortunately we couldn't notice the added benefit of the stereo speakers. In fact we find the loudspeaker sound of the competing Motorola maxx V6 better than the stereo output of the Z560. Unfortunately, there is no sound equalizer either. The supported file formats are MP3, AAC, WMA and AAC+. It also supports Playlists and ID3 tags which is a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Audio player with different visualizations ? audio player on the external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Headphones can be connected via the connectivity port. The external music control buttons come very handy when running the player in background with the device closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player has pretty much the same controls as the audio player. A serious difference though is that they come out as an overlay on the video stream and they can be hidden - meaning that you can watch a video fullscreen with no controls visible. The video player has its drawbacks too - for example you cannot watch a video in landscape mode. The Motorola maxx V6 can play video in landscape mode but it's not much needed feature on a clamshell handset since it is uncomfortable to hold it sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video player: controls on and off</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has approximately 20 MB internal memory and of course you can expand that with a microSD memory card. The file manager of the Z560 is pretty much standard. Different types of multimedia files are sorted in designated folders. The memory card appears as a separate submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   File manager ? memory card menu ? detailed memory status</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures submenu for example has its own submenus too - you can scroll through them by using the horizontal ways of the D-pad. Browsing through images wasn't a very nice experience since there was a definite lag while doing so. Furthermore you don't have an option for different view modes such as list or large thumbnails. The only available view mode is the default one - a list with small thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Browsing pictures</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An awkward camera?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z560 2 megapixel camera is equipped with autofocus. Unfortunately, the camera interface works in portrait mode only, but that is a something normal for a clamshell. The only good thing about it is that you can have the viewfinder work in fullscreen besides the regular window mode. When you use the viewfinder in the fulscreen mode, you cannot see the left and right edges of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera viewfinder: windowed and fullscreen mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has various features and effects but lacks flash, macro and night mode. You can zoom in the picture by using the UP and DOWN directions of the four-way control key. The LEFT and RIGHT direction keys adjust the white balance. With "1" key you toggle between camera and video mode. "2" is for toggling among the available resolutions, "3" is for changing capture quality, "4" is for multi shot sequence capturing (up to 12 pictures), "5" puts various light effects, "7" shows frames and other picture effects, "8" is for the self-portrait timer and "0" gets you to the Images folder. When you press the "#" button you switch between full screen and windowed mode. The two-way volume button changes the orientation of the camera lens. The DOWN way works as a mirror as it flips the picture view mirror-like. The UP way flips the picture upside down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera menu: shooting modes ? effects ? photo frames</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo quality is above average for a 2 megapixel camera and about average for a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus. Samsung Z560 takes really good macros; the lack of a dedicated macro mode is not a problem at all, just choose a macro subject and the camera will focus on it. The dynamic range is not bad for a phone and the indoor results are quite good. We didn't like much the colors of the outdoor photos, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to its HSDPA rival, Motorola RAZR maxx V6, the Samsung Z560 wins even considering the lack of a LED flash. Keep in mind, however that the same feature, which gives a lead to Samsung Z560, can let you down - the auto focus is slow and not always reliable, you might miss a shot, which is otherwise easy to take with a regular non-autofocus camera phone. Taking proper pictures of moving objects or of people on a party, for example, is a challenge. Take a look at our samples but bear in mind that we present you only with the successful shots we made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video mode the camera captures video at QCIF (176 x 144 pixels) resolution in 3GP format. We find that resolution pretty low for today's standards so we won't be showing you any video samples. In video mode there is no full screen option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HSDPA and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the Samsung Z560 is HSDPA-enabled. The supported standard is in fact HSDPA 1.8 Mbps. The competing Motorola maxx V6 supports 3.6 Mbps but not many mobile networks support this standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it seems speed will be all that matters with HSDPA-handsets becoming more and more popular in and wide spread in 2007. So we decided to conduct a little speed challenge of our own. We set up a MP3 file online which was 4MB in size or exactly 4,263,772 bytes. Then we downloaded it using several handsets in order to compare download speeds. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> UMTS &amp; HSDPA speed test</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If one looks at the download speeds which we have listed here, they may notice that the UMTS download speeds are closer to their theoretical maximum than the HSDPA speeds. A possible explanation might be that the bottleneck for HSDPA data transfers in the end will turn out to be the pure write speed of the device itself than any other thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A possible reason for the lack of difference between the download speeds of the Samsung Z560 and Motorola RAZR maxx V6 is the network limitation at 1.8 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other connectivity features of the Samsung Z560 are Bluetooth and USB. The USB may only be used with a custom data cable. The Bluetooth connection works seamlessly. PC synchronization was a piece of cake using Bluetooth. Unlike its primary competitor, the Motorola maxx V6, the Samsung Z560 doesn't have support for a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, there is no Infrared connectivity feature which makes connecting with older mobiles and other devices more difficult.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not a bad web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser manages nice with opening complex HTML pages. There is a URL remembering feature which helps the user when typing an address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing GSMArena.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three zoom levels which allow you to fit more of the webpage on the screen or zoom in to read some interesting content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Web browser: applying different zoom level</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tools of the trade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Organizer menu of the phone includes several applications: Calendar, Week view, Today's events, Schedule, Anniversary, Task, Memo, Missed event alarm. The Calendar application has both month and week view as the week view is the same feature as the Week view in the Organizer sub-menu. The Anniversary application is very useful and comes handy for adding birthday events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer ? Calendar: monthly, weekly and daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z560 also has an Alarm clock, a Voice memo, a World clock, a Calculator, and a Converter. The Alarms application allows for adding several alarms, which can be repeated on certain week days of your choice. The Voice memo application is a simple voice recorder which allows for up to 60 minutes of recording. Unfortunately, the voice recorder cannot be used during conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Alarms menu ? editing an alarm ? voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Time application is a simple graphical application seen on many other Samsung mobiles. The Calculator lacks any sophisticated features, while the Converter is for Currency, Length, Weight, Volume, Area and Temperature conversions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    World clock ? Calculator ? Unit converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an interesting application which allows you to view the underground public transport maps of several major cities.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some old games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only two preinstalled Java games in our Z560 version and they're both not very amusing. In fact they are the same we saw in the previous model Samsung Z540. Power Inline X is a roller skate simulation. The second game is The Last Age which is a first person sci-fi robot shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Power Inline X ? Last Age</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more amusing application in the Z560 - the mPet application. Unlike Java games, it loads instantly and works fast and practically it is a revival of the Tamagotchi tradition. It has nice graphics and is pretty amusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    mPet tamagotchi application</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, the Samsung Z560 offers a really nice package. It features high-speed data transfers plus a nice 2 megapixel camera and a gorgeous display. As we managed to find out the touch-sensitive external music keys and the stereo loudspeakers are only eye-candy for the users as their implementation is not that successful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out the Z560 primary competitor - the Motorola maxx V6 performs better in a number of aspects - a user friendly external display menu, a higher rated data speed, a better file manager, stereo Bluetooth and finally, a better camera. So we suggest that you opt for it, if you are looking for your next slim HSDPA clamshell.</paragraph>
