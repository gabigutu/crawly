			<paragraph>This holiday season we could not help but put together some insights on choosing the best mobile phone to keep you close to technology during the winter months. Christmas is about giving, so whether you are planning to make a "mobile" gift to someone or just help yourself with that all-in-one walkie-talkie, we are here to guide you in this year's top picks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a rule of thumb expensive doesn't necessarily mean better so choose carefully according to your needs. No matter what gift budget you have prepared to spend this year, feel free to browse all the categories we have prepared and have a look around your local shops - they might just have the deal for you at a special holiday price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind though, that if you plan on buying your mobile device from an online shop, you need to act quickly since shipping is always problematic around big holidays and you might end up with a post-Christmas present in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, all these categories are purely theoretical since nowadays mobile phones are more and more universal multimedia devices. Don't be stomped by technology, if you are not exactly the tech buff type of person. But again, if you are not at least interested in it, we doubt you would be reading this guide anyway. You won't find plain mobiles here - you can see plenty of them at your local mobile phones dealer and you would most probably be able to get some vanilla type of cell phone for free. It's not what this guide is about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you are interested in anything more than that jump right up to our first category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's of course, cameraphones - a real market hit this year. A regular shutterbug probably owns a personal digital camera anyway, but having one in your mobile is far more fun - plus it's always by your side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digital cameraphones made a huge leap this year and having a simple camera with VGA resolution (640x480) simply doesn't cut the mustard these days. A megapixel is not enough either and this year we are seeing mobile phones with cameras capable of capturing pictures at the whopping 5 megapixels. So starting our multi megapixel gift choices for this year's holiday season we have to mention Sony Ericsson K510 ($128*) first. That little baby managed to impress us with the quality of its 1.3 megapixel camera and you can buy it for cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the pixel count is not everything about digital photography and auto focus is a magic word that is sometimes the difference between make or break in amateur photography. So here again, we present you the all-time champion of the 2 megapixel class - Sony Ericsson K750 ($196*). It's been on the market for some time now and its price have been falling slowly but steadily. So now you can have it right on time for the holidays at a great bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson K510 | review ? Sony Ericsson K750 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is something about those Sony Ericsson handsets that just keeps getting them in the top 5 cameraphones chart. Maybe it's the "Sony" part in their name, who knows? Our next contender for your gift buying urge is the Sony Ericsson K800 ($349*) which is a great example for incorporating pure camera technology in a mobile phone. We are talking about its integrated xenon flash which would always come in handy when shooting indoors. Add the 3.2 megapixel lens and the present-of-the-year prize is yours for the taking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When talking about digital cameras, there is always that magical word - video. Well the bad news is that mobile phones have not improved much in that field. Most of them, including the popular K800, still capture video at the ancient QCIF (176 x 144 pixels) resolution at the appalling 15 frames per second. Let us tell you, if you are into video, 25 fps is the absolute minimum for a satisfactory result. There is one mobile phone though that managed to impress all with its video capturing capabilities and that is the Nokia N93 ($639*). It's a digital camcorder and a Symbian smartphone all in one. And it can shoot video with VGA resolution at 30 fps. Not to mention that it comes with a Carl-Zeiss optics with a 3x optical zoom lens. That's more than enough to keep your family get-togethers stored in your sweet memories collection. Unfortunately, it doesn't perform that good in the still pictures department. And? there is a price to pay for that camcording pleasure - a hefty price tag plus a bulky body of huge proportions. Those two reasons alone, provided for the fact that this Nokia model is not such a market success, but more of a technology showcase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson K800 | review ? Nokia N93 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also to consider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is more to choose from of course. There are two more excellent cameraphone solutions - each with a 3.2 megapixel camera and auto focus in their bags. The Samsung D900 ($339*) is an extremely slim slider and in this form factor it's probably the winner when it comes to picture quality. But it costs more than even Sony Ericsson K800. The second one is one great smartphone from Nokia with one great camera - it's the Nokia N73 ($449*). It's certainly the best cameraphone among Nokia smartphones but you have got to bear in mind that it doesn't come cheap.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Singing Christmas carols in the street is a nice past time but listening to something more modern while walking the dog, riding your bike or just taking a stroll in the park is far better. Then why not put your mobile phone to good use?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our category of music phones includes propositions that usually have a well developed software music player, dedicated external music keys, a standard 3.5 mm stereo audio jack for plugging in your own Hi-Fi headphones and have lot of usually expandable memory space for storing your music tracks. The FM radio tuner is also a must. As you would find, in the realm of music phones, the camera is not always that important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those of you that are into portable music players Sony Ericsson offers a fine line of Walkman-branded phones (is that "Sony" part in the name again) and no matter what budget you have prepared for this year's gift-buying and gift-giving frenzy, you are sure to find an adequate solution. The Sony Ericsson W950 ($525*) must be the flagship of all with its 4GB of integrated memory, a touchscreen TFT display and a Symbian 9.1 OS with the latest UIQ 3.0 user interface. It doesn't have a camera but after all, we are talking music here, aren't we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W950 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a music slider mobile phone would most definitely lead you to a choice between the Sony Ericsson W850 ($389*) and the Nokia 5300 ($239*). Both offer great customization features of their user interface and both have dedicated music keys and standard 3.5 mm audio jack adaptors for using your favorite headphones. The W850 though doesn't come cheap and cost a hefty $150 more than the 5300. But it has a good 2 megapixel camera and more stylish looks - at least according to us. Sound quality is not a point here since both mobiles offer almost the same listening pleasure. The Sony Ericsson W850 though promises up to 30 hours of playing time while the Nokia 5300 would keep you going for up to 9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson W850 | review ? Nokia 5300 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are on a strict budget there is one more solution that may save the day for you when buying a music phone - the Sony Ericsson W300 ($189*). With a VGA camera, a FM radio with RDS support and Memory Stick Micro (M2) memory card slot it makes a nice bargain and saves you from robbing a bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W300</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also to consider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the music category, there are also some interesting alternatives to consider since they score pretty well too. The Nokia 3250 ($339*) has an interesting swivel design of its lower half of the body. Rotating it replaces the usual alphanumeric keypad with dedicated music keys. This unique design alone makes it worth to consider when choosing a music phone. It also boasts a 2 megapixel camera, a standard 3.5 mm audio jack and FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W810 ($449*) is a somewhat midrange priced offer. It is an updated quad-band EDGE version of the popular W800 plus it comes with a great 2 megapixel camera with autofocus and more moderate design than the flamboyant W800 which was not everybody's favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 ($449*) is exclusive and expensive music smartphone with 4GB of integrated memory, dedicated music keys and a 3.5 mm audio jack. It has its flaws but who doesn't. If you fancy buying it, check out our detailed review beforehand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 3250 | review ? Sony Ericsson W810 | review ? Nokia N91 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Motorola ROKR E2 is not included here not because it's not a good music phone, but because Motorola choose to release it in Europe and North America in Q1, 2007.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now when all is said and done, having fun is still a concept deeply rooted in the holiday season. Buying a new fashion mobile is something like buying a new party outfit and it can equally impress others. If you are the type of person that wants everybody's heads turned at the next holiday party, then you should definitely take a look at this category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stylish doesn't always mean expensive as you would be quick to find out. There is one more fact about fashion mobiles that needs to be underlined - expensive doesn't always mean feature-packed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you mean to buy an eye-catching candy for your loved one, don't worry that you have to break the bank. Priced at entry level, with a fascinating sliding clamshell design and with plenty of color options, the Motorola PEBL U6 ($139*) might be just the party phone for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola PEBL U6 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recent additions in the clamshell form factor are also the Sony Ericsson Z610 ($269*) and the Motorola KRZR K1 ($279*), which are priced almost the same. Bear in mind though that glossy mirror surface usually means a lot of fingerprints. The Sony Ericsson Z610 scores better with UMTS (3G) with video calls support, an external OLED display, and a more durable battery. Plus, Sony Ericsson mobiles traditionally have a better user interface than Motorola's and although the KRZR interface has received a facelift, it still drags behind when it comes to graphics and customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Z610 | review ? Motorola KRZR K1 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the market hits this year, the LG KG800 Chocolate ($249*) most certainly manages to impress with its touch-sensitive navigation keypad glowing in red. If you are buying a mobile for a fashion girl that might just be your best pick this holiday season.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great revival for the high-end Nokia 8-series is the new Nokia 8800 Sirocco edition ($835*), which not only possesses style and elegance but has that all-important exclusiveness that only a matching price tag offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KG800 Chocolate | review ? Nokia 8800 Sirocco | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also to consider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Trying to build on the success of the famous Motorola V3, the American manufacturer has two more eye-pleasing offers that would make you proud. Those are the Motorola RAZR V3i D&amp;G ($325*) and the Motorola RIZR ($295*). While the RIZR is a slider-styled reincarnation of the RAZR, the V3i D&amp;G is its full copy but in gold. It didn't gain much popularity may be because it lacked exclusivity or because it has the same trite design that you see almost every day now in the different versions of the RAZR. Nevertheless, it would make a great gift choice as long as the person it is for is into gold accessories. Not every one likes the bling-bling style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fashion mobiles are not meant for women only. The Samsung P310 ($459*) is a nice example with its elegant minimalist design and connoisseur accessories. The price is hefty too, no doubt about it. Samsung tried to follow the success of the LG Chocolate and produced a manlier handset that most definitely deserves a look. The Samsung E900 ($249*) features touch-sensitive navigation keypad and is nicely feature-packed but failed to gain the popularity of the fans in the same way that the Chocolate did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year was not the best of all for Benq-Siemens but still they managed to produce an impressive slim clamshell entirely made out of metal. The BenQ-Siemens EF81 can easily grab your attention and it most certainly deserves it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola RIZR ? Samsung P310 ? Samsung E900 ? BenQ-Siemens EF81</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the end, if money are no object when choosing the ultimate fashion mobile, you may as well browse the exclusive Vertu phones that easily capture imagination with exclusive materials and design to make you stand out in the crowd in every possible way.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Mobile phones on a diet are the trendy fashion line this year. Slim is now more than plain RAZR thin. So have a look at the current menu?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a starter, we would recommend you the Motorola SLVR L7 ($139*). It's a light appetizer in the bar form factor, which has borrowed a lot from the RAZR. It's modest in functions but rather expressive in design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A similar bar-shaped work of art is the ultra slim Samsung X820 ($249*) - a lightweight contender for the main dish, equipped with a 2 megapixel camera which is the only thing that breaks its even straight lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola SLVR L7 | review ? Samsung X820 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has put a lot of effort to being slim this year and beside the X820 there are two more handsets from their Ultra thin line-up. We present you the slimmest clamshell Samsung D830 ($259*) and the slimmest slider Samsung D900 ($339*) which has a nice 3.2 megapixel camera. We already recommended you the D900 for reconsideration when looking for a cameraphone, since it's the slider with the greatest image quality pictures up-to-date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung D830 ? Samsung D900 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also to consider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot help but look to one of the RAZR updated versions - namely the Motorola RAZR V3i ($195*). It's got what it takes to compete with modern phones although design-wise, honestly, we are already sick with the RAZR mania and it's time somebody end it. Thanks to LG and Samsung we have two more propositions for your reconsideration here and those are the LG KG320 ($209*) and the Samsung P310 ($459*). They are both classic bar-shaped handsets with manlier looks. The Samsung wins by a millimeter when it comes to slimness, but only after it's taken out of it leather case. Feature-wise it's also the sure winner and its current price, more than twice the one of the KG320, makes it more than exclusive.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Some people like them smart? Well this is as smart as it gets - in the mobile realm at least? Smartphones have become more and more affordable this year and it is a tendency that would last. Maybe among the cheapest one is the Nokia E50-1 ($249*), which is based on the latest Symbian 9.1 OS with the S60 3rd edition user interface. This version comes equipped with a 1.3 megapixel camera and except 3G and Wi-Fi it's got all that it takes to become a great choice for a gift to people that would fancy a smartphone but never could afford one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our favorite universal smartphone is again Finnish made - it's the Nokia E70 ($339*). Complete with a folding QWERTY keypad and a great 16 million colors TFT display with a resolution of 352 x 416 pixels, UMTS (3G) and Wi-Fi support it managed to win our hearts in every possible way. Add the 2 megapixel camera and the long battery-life, and your top-notch holiday gift is wrapped up and ready to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E50 | review ? Nokia E70 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Nokia model, Nokia N80 ($439*), became very popular this year, a high-end slider that was among the first 3.2 megapixel mobiles on the European market. Its feature-rich equipment would make it the ideal Swiss army knife for the technology eager fans if it wasn't for its lack of auto focus and short battery life. After all a smartphone is only as good as its battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe you have come to notice our inclination to Nokia smartphones and it's for a good reason. The Finnish manufacturer managed to surprise us all with their solutions in the upper market range and if it wasn't for the lack of GPS and a touchscreen we could whole-heartedly recommend them to everyone that might need a smart device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we've come to a top-class PocketPC solution, the latest addition to the well-known line of smart devices produced and sold by HTC. It's the HTC P3300 and it represents in a way everything that could possibly be fitted into a portable device that's convenient enough to carry around throughout the whole day - Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, USB, a 2 megapixel camera, you name it. And all that is fitted into a stylish slim body. If it weren't for the somewhat weak 200MHz processor and the lack of 3G, it would be the ultimate smart solution. But in the world of PocketPC there is never an ideal combination of features and design - it's always a question of compromise.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After all, trying to stay in touch with your loved ones (and you business partners) can be frustrating at times. Dropping a line or writing an email is always a good alternative - that is if you have the right gear in your hands. Speaking about writing, have you ever tried using a QWERTY keypad on a mobile device? Well it's unexpectedly comfortable and you might as well try that for the first time with our QWERTY gift guide propositions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out the Nokia E70 ($339*) is among the finest Symbian smartphones and what is more it comes equipped with an intriguing folding QWERTY keypad with keys that are large enough to allow for a great typing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have another interesting QWERTY solution for your messaging needs and it comes complete with a sliding drawer-like keyboard. It offers more than a smartphone but comes at a hefty price, too. It's the HSDPA-enabled HTC TyTN formerly known as Qtek 9600 - a fully-fledged Windows Mobile PocketPC that can offer more than every smartphone out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E70 | review ? HTC TyTN</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot help but jump up with another Nokia here and it's again from the business E-series - the Nokia E61 ($365*). It's a 3G smartphone with a large 16 million colors TFT display equipped with almost every possible connectivity feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, there is a top-notch Blackberry solution that continues the line of those highly popular business communicators, targeted at people for whom emailing is everything - the Blackberry Pearl 8100 ($529*). And indeed a pearl it is - with a stylish slim body and an amazing weight of just below 90g.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The world is changing fast. So are the current mobile data transfer speeds. Today's high-speed data transfers allow seamless video and sound streaming to suit your multimedia needs in every possible way - from live TV to making video calls. Check out some of the contenders in the "fast" 3G lane. UMTS or also known as 3G is now commonplace in big metropolitan areas. There is no need to wonder that there are a lot of 3G solutions out there. We present you the selected few that managed to impress us this year. When picking up our contenders we didn't mean for them to be representative of the certain category, since there are a lot of highly sophisticated smartphones out there that have UMTS support. Instead, we chose to highlight devices whose focus is the 3G capabilities themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off is the Sony Ericsson K610 ($225*), which also seems to be the cheapest of the gang. The K610 is a trustworthy companion in the 3G world and although it has the smaller price tag, it does feature a secondary VGA camera for making video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking about video calls, the Nokia 6233 ($259*), our next offer in that category, doesn't offer those, although you could theoretically make video calls with it - as long as you use the main 2 megapixel camera which also happens to record videos at VGA resolution - unfortunately, at a lower framerate of 15 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson K610 | review ? Nokia 6233 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also have nice 3G solutions in the face of the clamshell Samsung Z510 ($275*) and the more expensive slider Samsung Z400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a handset that is not so much of a 3G-centric solution but that manages to overwhelm the realm of multimedia - the Nokia N73 ($449*). Equipped with the finest 3 megapixel camera produced by Nokia up-to-date, it's powered by the Symbian 9.1 OS and doesn't leave no doubt that it's made for having fun. If not else, one thing's for sure - Nokia has implemented in it one of the greatest web browsers we have seen in a mobile handset during the past year. The browser integrated into the latest edition of the S60 user interface offers functionality and ease of use that exceeds the competing solutions by a wide margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Z510 ? Nokia N73 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also to consider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3G is still gaining popularity, while newer and faster data transfer technologies are being implemented in networks worldwide. The HSDPA or the so-called 3.5G is the next level high-speed mobile data standard and if you happen to be among the lucky few that live in an area with that sort of network coverage, please feel free to check the currently available HSDPA mobiles.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are into athletics though, there is a couple of mobiles that may just make you heart melt with joy. Unfortunately, lately there aren't that many rugged designed phones with enhanced durability which you can freely take on your mountain hike. In the past, there were a few strong product lines by Siemens, Ericsson and Nokia, which no longer exist to a great disappointment for their numerous fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's still more to see in that category though and our first offer is Benq-Siemens M81, which seems as the only company too keep their traditions in producing enhanced durability mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Benq-Siemens M81</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W710 ($275*) does not exactly come into a toughened shell with improved resistance but it's all a sports person would dream of. It sports the Walkman logo for a good reason since it offers a fully-fledged music player. What is more, it has an integrated pedometer, several sports applications and a whole bunch of sports accessories such as an armband, a tough belt clip and sports-oriented headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the last tough shell to break is the one of the Nokia 5500 ($269*), a sports smartphone based on the Symbian 9.1 OS, complete with a splash and dust resistant body and a plethora of sports applications.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The workhorses in our holiday gift guide are not your usual cameraphones to take on your family weekends. In fact those devices are strictly business-oriented and they don't have a camera for a good reason. Let's just say that there are some sensitive workplaces where your bosses would get really edgy if you show up with a digital camera in your pocket - be it a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you or your loved one just happens to work at some place like that, rest assured that they do not need to be deprived of the current technological advances in the mobile world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not a coincidence that Nokia has produced their Nokia E50 ($249*) "budget" smartphone in two variants - one with a camera and a second one without one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another E-series Nokia smartphone comes with no camera at all. The Nokia E60 ($262*) managed to impress us with its strict minimalist design and the various connectivity options it offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E50 | review ? Nokia E60 | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson smartphones are based on the Symbian OS too, but they have another user interface, called UIQ. It's totally different from the S60 used by Nokia and is optimized for use with touchscreens. The Sony Ericsson M600 ($309*) is a touchscreen Symbian smartphone with a QWERTY keypad and again, no camera at all. Its strict lines and forms leave no doubt we are talking business here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson M600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it's time for us to wrap it up and go look for some gifts for our loved ones too. This article was our attempt at saving you some time when looking for a holiday present for your friends or relatives, or even one for yourself. We won't make claims that its thorough and exhaustive or that it covers all the available options in the different categories. What we wanted to show you are the highlights of this year's achievements in the mobile industry. However, if you still don't find the right handset, please feel free to continue browsing our mobile phones database using the Phone Finder.</paragraph>
