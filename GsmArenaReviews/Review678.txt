			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have in our anxious reviewer hands the current top-dog of the Asus 7-inch crowd, the Memo Pad 7 ME572C. The Asus naming convention doesn't help much in identifying specific models and one must resort to alphanumeric internal designations to differentiate it from the more humble Memo Pad 7 ME176C. The "C" in the end designates the Wi-Fi only version of the tablet, which we'll be reviewing, as opposed to the "CL" LTE-enabled model. Other than the cellular connectivity, however, both models are identical and our findings are equally true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus boasts an extensive lineup of affordable tablets with multiple offerings spanning the entire range from 7" to 10". No less than five distinct 7-inchers are in existence, launched since 2014, and then we have a few more from earlier before, notably the Asus-made Google Nexus 7 (2013).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, the tablet in question has a lot going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the Memo Pad 7 ticks all of the right boxes, and our complaints are more nitpicking than actual design blunders. The sharp display is the best in the company's lineup at this size and is easily into Retina-grade pixel density territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Intel's upper midrange chipset should be comparable to the popular flagship-grade Snapdragon 800. GPU is the same as in the iPhone 5S, but here it's clocked higher and should be able to beat the Adreno 330 bundled with the Snapdragon 800. 2GB or RAM allow for unhindered multitasking, while the expandable storage means plenty of room for content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design is a throwback to the Nexus 7 with the same camera and button placement and overall footprint, albeit with sharp corners this time around. That's not to say that the Memo Pad 7 doesn't possess its own personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are just first impressions, though. Follow us as we delve deeper into our review routine, starting with a closer look at the body and design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tablet comes in a box marginally larger in footprint than the device itself, but perhaps its depth might lead you to believe it packs a bunch of accessories. Sadly, that's not the case. With a wall charger and a USB cable, only the bare necessities are covered. To be fair, that seems to be the norm for tablets in general, so Asus isn't to blame.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C is not immediately recognizable as a member of the Asus tablet family. Lacking company branding on the front and sporting sharp corners as opposed to the rounded ones of previous models, you'd be forgiven to mistake the tablet for a noname Chinese slate. It looks a lot like a Nokia N9 stretched to Nexus 7 proportions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear settles it quickly, though, with an Asus logo across the center. The back on our black review unit is pleasantly textured and provides comfortable and secure grip. Perhaps the alternative color options will differ in this respect with their smoother matte finishes. They will also more obviously convey the designers' concept of a flap-like appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides are nicely rounded and sit well in the hands when the device is held in portrait orientation. Landscape mode, on the other hand, puts the sharp corners on the middle of the user's palms and, while not a deal-breaker, may prove uncomfortable for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another questionable decision is the speakers placement. When the tablet is held in landscape they'll end up being blocked by your hands more often than not. On the other hand, putting the device flat on a surface will have no detrimental effect on sound output. One positive side of the generous bezels is that they provide enough real estate to handle the slate without blocking the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus claims to have applied an anti-fingerprint coating, but it doesn't do a particularly good job and the whole front is covered in smudges in just a few finger swipes. A Corning Concore glass is employed, which documentation reveals has a three times lower indentation load than the Gorilla Glass 3. So you may be wise to pick up a screen protector if you have poor history in protecting your tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C measures 200 x 114.4 x 8.3mm and weighs in at 269g. It's a whole 1.3mm thinner and 26g lighter than the (stay focused) Asus Memo Pad 7 ME176C. It's worth mentioning that the LTE version of the currently reviewed slate is a smidge heavier at 279g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One-handed operation is possible due to the grippy back surface and adequate button placement. That said, at 7 inches the tablet is best held with both hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression is of a very solid build. The device feels very well put together and materials are of good quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The top of the device is home to one of the two speakers, housed behind a 14mm slit. Towards the right you can find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The bottom sees the second speaker, right in the middle, symmetrical to the top one. The microUSB port is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the tablet is where the physical power button and volume rocker are placed. If you have average hands, you shouldn't have trouble reaching them with one hand, even if it's not the most graceful of exercises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD slot is on the left side, of the push-to-insert-push-to-eject variety. The device sits somewhat unfinished without a card in, not that anyone around here is a particular supporter of plastic flaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is home solely to the main 5MP camera in the top left corner. The 2MP front facer is above the display, accompanied by an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C packs the best screen in the company's 7-inch tablet lineup, a 1920x1200 pixel IPS panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display possesses what's become known as Retina-grade 323ppi density and indeed, everything is tack sharp. Viewing angles are equally good, with no loss of contrast or color shift to speak of. The screen is rather reflective though, and quite prone to smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has also provided the Splendid app that allows the users to tweak their display colors to their liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual test routine on the Memo Pad 7 and it aced it. The maximum brightness level is the highest we've seen on a tablet, save for Asus' own Transformer pad TF701T from two years ago, if you can even call that a tablet. The Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact barely manages to compete with the Memo Pad 7, and the rest of potential rivals are far behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black value is somewhat high which prevents the ME572C from snatching the top spot in contrast, but a score in the 1100s is still an excellent achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our tests revealed that the 50% setting is actually more like 25%, which has become a common occurrence among smartphones and tablets alike. Contrast ratio is solid at this setting as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the Memo Pad 7 suffers somewhat from the reflective screen coating. The high brightness, however, maintains text clearly legible even in direct sunlight. Which is not to say that you should deliberately hold the tablet with the sun mirrored towards your eyes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery in the Memo Pad 7 ME572C is the same 3950mAh unit as in the ME176C model, which has less than half the pixels of the currently reviewed unit. That said, the ME176C posted great scores in our dedicated battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad 7 ME572C showed excellent longevity in the web browsing routine with just shy of 12 hours, actually beating the ME176C by close to an hour. Video playback turned out more taxing on the battery, but 10 whole hours is a very respectable score nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C we are testing is a Wi-Fi only device. There is a 4G version as well, for those of you, who require autonomous surfing capability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That one supports quad-band GSM, 3G over 800/850/900/1700/1900/2100MHz, as well as hepta-band LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes a dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support as well as Wi-Fi Direct functionality. There's Bluetooth 4.0 and wireless display connectivity over the Miracast protocol, no wired TV-Out option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and wired data connectivity and USB OTG support so you can mount external drives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZenUI on top of Android KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad 7 ME752C runs on Android KitKat 4.4.2 with a range of Asus customizations. The company has opted for a light overall look and the proprietary applications have a consistent interface. Check it out in the brief video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface features the traditional Android lockscreen, showing the time and date alongside weather information. There's a few shortcuts to the camera, email app, and web browser, as well as a Google Now shortcut from the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side, there's a look at the latest reminders from Asus What's Next application, which shows upcoming events, reminders, weather info, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom, the app drawer shortcut always in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the ample space available, you cannot add more icons beyond these four, but there is folder support. There are preloaded Asus and Google folders, which contain a selection of applications from the respective companies - custom Asus apps in one, and the default Google apps in the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rotating the tablet in landscape orientation will shift the shortcut dock to the right, while the on-screen contextual buttons remain at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch zoom lets you rearrange your homescreens, as well as select a default homescreen and add additional ones - up to seven total. Unlike other custom Android overlays, which omit the app drawer altogether, Asus have opted to stick with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an elegant notification area that only takes up as much space as there are notifications, rather than wasting the whole screen. It's evoked with a pull down from the left half of the status bar. Clearing notifications is done with a sideways swipe or through the 'Clear' button, which does away with all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access quick toggles and brightness slider by dragging from the right side of the status bar. A two-finger swipe will always open your quick toggles, regardless of finger positioning. You can jump to the alternative shade via a button in the top right corner. You can, of course, also customize which toggles appear as shortcuts, and holding down on a toggle will take you to the relevant menu in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is accessed with the on-screen contextual button. You get a thumbnail of the app along with its icon, and you can swipe apps to the side to close them. There's a "Clear all" button for when you have a large number of apps open.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C is pretty heavily armed for a brand name midrange tablet, costing only ?200. The company has been employing Intel silicon for some time and the powerful Atom Z3560 was chosen to power the ME572C. The chipset is manufactured using a 22nm process for improved performance and power efficiency over the majority of Qualcomm and Mediatek offerings. Its four cores are clocked at 1.83MHz, but Intel's architecture allows for better per clock performance, which should be on par with the Snapdragon 800. The GPU is an import, namely the PowerVR G6430 found in Apple's iPhone 5S, where it performed admirably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the full range of benchmarks on the Memo Pad 7 and the results confirmed our initial thoughts. The first set of tests, Antutu 5.0, Geekbench 3 and Basemark OS II test the CPU and overall system performance. The great Antutu 5.0 score is comparable to the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, which features a Snapdragon 801 chipset, 3GB of RAM and a much higher price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Geekbench 3.0 result was respectable as well, with the ME572C posting a similar score to the lesser model in the Asus lineup, both crushing the LG G Pad 7.0 with its modest Snapdragon 400 inside. Devices packing the high-end nVidia Tegra K1 are naturally in a league of their own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the broader Basemark OS II benchmark, we witness a similarly solid performance. In the overall results the Memo Pad 7 is again beaten by the Tegra-packing duo, but inches ahead of the iPad mini 2 and outperforms the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 by a wide margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to graphics the Memo Pad 7 doesn't disappoint either. It's a top performer, easily beating the competition in GFXBench, on-screen and off. Both scenarios yield similar results, as the standardized off-screen resolution of 1080p is close to tablet's native one. Basemark X, however, tells a slightly different story, with the Asus tablet trailing behind rivals but still posting good numbers.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing performance is respectable as well. The good Kraken 1.1 figures were in the same ballpark when running both the stock browser and Google Chrome. On the other hand, in BrowserMark 2.1 Chrome fared noticeably better, scoring around the 1600 mark, as opposed to the 1200s of the built-in offering, which is shown in the charts below. Apparently, it's not that good in munching on JavaScript.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Overall, the Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C is the solid performer its specs promised it to be. It's consistently near the top of the charts, with the Atom Z3560 unable to compete only with the nVidia Tegra K1. It has to be pointed out, though, that currently there is only a handful of devices utilizing that chipset. The Nexus 9, for instance, is about twice as expensive as the Memo Pad 7, while the Xiaomi Mi Pad may be hard to find outside of its home market and it's cheaper looking that the Asus Memo Pad 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmarks aside, the tablet feels snappy in actual use and doesn't leave you waiting. Scrolling through the homescreens and app drawer is smooth, apps load quickly and multitasking is not a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no messaging app on the Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C but you get two email clients to work with. The standard client has a clean simple white interface with your email folders on the left and your list of messages on the right. If you add more than one account and you get a combined view of all your emails from each accounts. The Email app can handle Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is also here, so you'll have a handy way to message all of your Google and Gmail contacts from one interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is done through an Asus keyboard, which has a separate number row as well as a smiley key. Secondary characters are also available with a tap-and-hold action. On this screen the keys are comfortably large in both portrait and landscape mode. Reaching the middle of the tablet when held horizontally is unconfortable though, and no optimizations are provided. There is support for swipe typing, handwriting and voice input.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C comes with a custom Gallery app with decent functionality. It defaults to an album view where your camera roll sits at the top with thumbnails that flip through the entire camera folder. Below them you get thumbnails of your other albums, two in a row, which you can't resize. Once you're in the album of choice, thumbnails can be resized from one to six in a row with a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it, enter edit mode or just get more info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights. You can have multiple versions of the edited image and compare the applied effects among them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad 7 video player has a very basic interface with none of the nifty extras like subtitle support, equalizers, or playback speed that you'll find on more mainstream launchers. It features just a playback slider, a play/pause button, and an orientation switch. A lone sharing button sits at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in video player only managed to play MPEG4 files, and failed when faced with Xvid and DivX movies. It's a codec support issue, likely. You can always resort to installing a third-party player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus music player does decently in terms of functionality, covering all the basics. It has a large Now Playing window with prominent album art, and also has integrated bass boost and surround sound options, although both of those only work with headphones. An equalizer is also available with multiple presets and a single custom setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also sync Cloud services like Google Drive to stream your music collection without having to transfer it to the tablet, and you can also playback from local media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C and it posted an Average result. The stereo speakers provide adequate sound, and truth be told, few tablets excel in this test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C did well in our audio quality test although it hardly broke any records. The tablet had perfectly clean output when connected to an active external amplifier and garnished it with reasonably high volume levels. It's not the loudest out there, much less in the tablet division, but it's good enough so the vast majority of users will never know the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and things start to go south though - most of the readings are still good, but stereo crosstalk creeps in as well as some intermodulation distortion. Frequency response starts to fluctuate a bit as well and with volume levels also dropping, the performance here is above average at best.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not much of a 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C is equipped with a 5MP main shooter at the back, which captures images up to 2560x1920 pixels and video up to 1080p. The app interface is combined, offering a screen shutter release button and a video record button side by side. The volume rocker can be set either as shutter release or zoom control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An array of shooting modes are available on top of the Auto including Night, Panorama and HDR. A selfie mode helps utilize the main camera for the purpose, acknowledging that the front camera is to be used for video calls only. Depth of field takes two shots and combines them in one image for a closeup with a blurred background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu offers control over white balance, ISO, exposure compensation, the lot. The list is scrollable through still, video and general options with tabs for quick access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all looks good on paper, but the reality is that image quality is, to put it bluntly, poor. Apparently Asus is determined to discourage users from using a tablet as a camera and is sticking with this policy. The camera seems to be carried over from the ME176C model, judging by our similar findings on this one. Or simply it fell in the category of corners that need to be cut to make the budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, the images produced by the Memo Pad 7 are only good for casual snaps that won't make it to paper and shouldn't be viewed at full magnification. Close inspection reveals little resolved detail and the photos have a watercolor look to them. Dynamic range is limited and it is not helped by the automatic exposure, which produces random results over consecutive shots of the same scene within a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, focus is reasonably fast and accurate and the camera feels snappy in use. It also did fairly well for its own standards in macro shooting where it was able to get really close to the subject and still acquire sharp focus. With such a large slate, casting its shadow, however, lighting becomes problematic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode only works a small percentage of the time. In most cases it produces a strong purplish cast resulting in an unusable picture. When it does work, the gains in dynamic range are largely offset by the detail that's being sacrificed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Panorama mode the tablet produced usable images with seamless stitching and even exposure. In portrait orientation the image came out at around 8MP with a height of around 1800 pixels. Linear objects nearby have jagged edges though, so you should keep that in mind when framing the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the camera on the Memo Pad 7 is only good as a last resort. You can check out how it fared in our controlled studio environment using the tool below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Asus Memo Pad 7 ME752C top at 1080p/30fps. Bitrate is just shy of 15Mbps and audio is recorded at 192kbps, a step up from the 96kbps of the ME176C.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We weren't anticipating miracles after our experience with the stills shooting, but we ended up disappointed nonetheless. For starters, the video camera field of view is drastically narrower than the still camera's and the viewfinder doesn't prepare you for the difference, which only becomes apparent when you hit the video record button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to quality, things don't get any better. The advertised 1080p resolution is more of a wish than reality and the level of detail is similar to a decent 480p video. The mediocre audio output adds to the overall grim impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a short 1080p@30fps video sample (00:10s, 18.5MB) taken straight from the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C comes with the standard Android browser. It features largely the same functionality as Google's Chrome browser (also included), and feels much the same in actual use. The stock browser, however, cannot be set to hide the tabs and address bar on top, eating precious screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome provides decent web browsing performance under Android, and comes with integration to its desktop counterpart through your Google account. It also offers incognito browsing, offline viewing, and much more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 ME572C offers its own file managing app that allows you to easily manage your video, picture, and document files, although there is no document viewer/editor pre-installed. There are plenty for free in the Play Store though (even ones made by Google), so this shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views in a split-screen configuration. There's also a quick Agenda view that shows all of our events regardless of where they're recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app also features a world clock feature that displays the location across various time zones, and has an integrated stopwatch and time. There's also a calculator app that has advanced functions in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a SuperNote app that aims to provide similar functionality as Samsung's S Memo app found its Galaxy Note series, except without the stylus support. It supports a wide range of templates and handwriting recognition that'll automatically separate your writing across lines. A handy Dictionary app is also on board, which can pronounce words and offers a direct link to the Wikipedia article on the word in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storybook app lets you use your photos to make interactive albums that you can then share with other Storybook users. You can choose which photos to include, separate them in any configuration you like, as well as include sound, effects, and text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo Pad 7 comes with an equalizer that is always enabled, and allows you to set various sound profiles depending on your usage scenario. Accessing the AudioWizard app lets you quickly set the sound mode using a popup with one of six presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Power consumption can be further optimized using the Power Saver app. You can select from Ultra-saving or Optimized mode, which will toggle keeping the wireless connection active when the device is locked. Customized mode lets you set the brightness levels across the different apps you use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A ZenLink package of four apps provides added functionality. PC Link enables you to control the tablet from your computer, via an application you download from the Asus website. Once the application is installed and the two devices paired, a resizable mockup tablet window appears on your desktop and you can use your mouse to send commands to the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remote Link does just the opposite, turning your Memo Pad into a remote for your PC. Another desktop app needs to be installed and communication takes place over Bluetooth. The Share Link and Party Link apps are two additional options for quick and easy exchange of photos and what not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Memo Pad 7 relies on Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially neat thing that you should definitely check out if you haven't already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever may be missing in the preinstalled apps, you'll find it in Google's Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Asus should have opted for a better name for Memo Pad 7 ME752C that sets it apart from the rest of the company's tablets, because on paper and in real life the slate is truly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beautiful screen is its key selling point and it is simply a pleasure to behold. This 7 incher is sharp, bright, with great viewing angles and accurate colors, which you can even tweak if you feel like it.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The device is finely crafted, the plastics are of high quality and the body doesn't show any tendency to bend, creek or rattle. It's a quietly stylish design that works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the summary of the key test findings in this review:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The market is filled with compact tablets with 7-inch screens from major brands and unknown manufacturers alike. Even so, finding such a comprehensive package in the price range of the Memo Pad 7 ME572C proves a difficult task. It's currently priced at ?200/$200 for the 16GB version and that severely limits the list of competitors. Not that there were many to start with, featuring a FullHD resolution at this screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus-made Google Nexus 7 (2013) is where the roots of the ME572C lie and the resemblance is obvious. The Google branded offering retails at around the same price as the Memo Pad 7 in some markets, but is a good ?60/$70 more expensive elsewhere. Not to mention it doesn't have a microSD slot. The display on the Nexus 7 is equally good, RAM is the same 2GB, but the chipset is showing its age, and can't really compete with the Atom ticking inside the Memo Pad 7. The Nexus badge does promise timely Android updates, though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A top rival of the Memo Pad 7 ME572C is the Xiaomi Mi Pad 7.9. That is, if you can get your hands on one, as its availability is largely limited to the Asian market. It's a step up from the Asus offering in every respect, while its list price is the same. Exporting a Mi Pad 7.9 outside of China, however, quickly brings the price up by as much as 50%, and the matter of warranty and support remains to be considered.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia N1 packs an even more powerful Intel Atom Z3580 paired with the same PowerVR G6430 GPU and 2GB. The display is again a 7.9-inch IPS panel with a 1536 x 2048 pixel resolution, just like the Xiaomi. The price is somewhat higher at $255, but the real issue is that the tablet is only available in China for the time being.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another region-specific option is the Kindle Fire HDX. The Amazon slate comes with a similarly powerful Snapdragon 800 and 2 GB of RAM and its screen is the same in size and resolution. It's actually somewhat cheaper but at the cost of running a heavily customized Android build and the lack of a microSD slot.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>With the Memo Pad 7 ME572C Asus has managed to come up with a truly compelling compact tablet offering. It has a wonderful display, it performs well and is attractively priced. Its only major shortcoming is its poor camera so if tablet photography is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere.</paragraph>
