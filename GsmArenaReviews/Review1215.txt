			<subsectionTitle>Press conference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei's press conference marks the beginning of the quad-core smartphone era at this year's Mobile World Congress, which yet again is held in sunny Barcelona. The Chinese have raised the expectations high and are keen to put themselves on the Android map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big small player has grown ambitious to play in the same ballpark as the big Droids from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony and Motorola. Huawei's punchline is "Incredibly fast and about to take off" put next to their impressive looking pegasus made up of smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But words alone won't be enough for the Chinese to truly rise above the competition. They need something truly jaw-dropping. This is where the Ascend line-up comes in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the stage, Huawei's top brass presented the company's flagship - the Ascend D quad, the Ascend D quad XL, the Ascend D1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the jaw-dropping moment - Huawei have built their own quad-core chipset, which they say smokes everybody else's hardware out of the game and is the fastest quad-core processor the world has seen. Now Huawei proudly stands next to Texas Instruments, Samsung, Nvidia and Qualcomm in the system-on-a-chip manufacturer list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones aren't Huawei's only strong hand. The ace hiding in the Chinese sleeve is a 10.1-inch MediaPad, which in Huawei's world, proudly stands against the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we've been out there on the showroom floors to see if their statements hold any ground or is it just catchy phrases for the press release. Let's get to the hands-on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D quad hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's the Android smartphone everybody will be talking about this year. The Ascend D quad is Huawei's first true attempt at becoming the king of the Android hill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And at first glance it ticks all the boxes. It's built around a 4.5-inch IPS+ display rocking a 720p (1280x720 pixels) HD resolution and 330 ppi pixel density. With this kind of screen specs, it's poking fun at the iPhone 4S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is simply gorgeous and Huawei claim the sunlight legibility is awesome and at this point we are inclined to believe them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood, the Ascend D quad, as the name suggests, features Huawei's very own quad-core K3V2 processors with 1.2GHz and 1.5GHz clock speed variations. The Chinese have coupled this with 1GB of RAM and, as a result, the Ascend D quad literally flies through everything in Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of ICS, Huawei haven't done a lot of work to it, which could indicate that they won't be any custom skins or other addons when the device starts shipping. We tried playing a full HD 1080p video and the Ascend D quad didn't break a sweat. Even when randomly jumping from the start to the middle and the end, and back, lags and stutter were virtually non-existent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend D quad measures 129mm x 64mm x 8.9mm and, with its 130 grams of weight, it hits the sweetspot for a Droid with such powerful internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the device is pleasant and doesn't exude cheapness. The back of the Ascend D quad is especially nice with its special texture, which feels good to the touch. The red outline of the camera unit and the red speaker grille are nice accents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the camera, it's a 1080p video-capable 8MP auto-focus unit with a dual LED flash. At the front, there's an 1.3MP HD camera, which can shoot 720p video, if you ever need it to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei also bragged about their special dual-microphone noise cancellation technology dubbed earSmart. Add that to the 1800mAh battery, Bluetooth 3, Wi-Fi 802.11n and 5.1 surround sound with Dolby Mobile 3.0 Plus and the Ascend D quad becomes quite a package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend D1 debuted right after the flagship Ascend D quad and sets aim at the mid-range Androids out there. This time around, it's not powered by a Huawei chip, but by a TI OMAP 4460 with a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display-wise, the D1 packs a 4.5-inch, 720p IPS+ screen of 330ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the Ascend D1 features an 8MP, 1080p video recording camera with dual LED flash. A 1.3MP snapper at the front takes care of video conferencing and does 720p video, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei MediaPad 10.1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As cruel as this is, Huawei only allowed a glimpse of their 10.1-inch version of the MediaPad tablet. They teased everyone on the floor by saying it's a quad-core slate with a 1080p (1920 x 1200) IPS display that can easily match the iPad 3. Run, ASUS Transformer Prime!</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jokes aside, the MediaPad 10.1 uses the same Huawei K3V2 processor to hum along coupled with 2GB of RAM. At the back we find an 8MP camera with 1080p video recording abilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Storage is just 8GB, but don't despair, there's a microSD card slot on board. As you'll see from the photos below, the MediaPad 10.1 is quite slim held in the hands of the beautiful Huawei model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad weighs 598 g and is 8.8 mm thick and is encased in an aluminum unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connectivity options include LTE and HSPA+, probably in separate variants depending on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad will be globally available to users in Q2 of 2012.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page for another batch of live photos and first-hand impressions of the new devices from the MWC booth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei booth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also stopped by the Huawei booth at the MWC to spend some more quality time with their newly announced products.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D quad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are pleased to report the great first impression of the Huawei Ascend D quad stood after our second meeting. The quad core smartphone feels impressively snappy and its HD IPS+ LCD is a joy to behold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone handles quite decently, its rubberized back providing a decent amount of grip. The pattern that you see on the back is actually paint and the plastic is perfectly smooth. It is still quite resistant to fingerprint smudges, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We looked closer this time and we still couldn't find any customizations to the stock Android 4.0.3 on the Huawei Ascend D quad. The smartphone feels like a Galaxy Nexus, except for the part that it's much faster to navigate around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the custom skins add a bit to usability (most notably TouchWiz and Sense), stock Android should fare better in terms of update speed. With no custom skins to worry about, Huawei will just need to modify the chipset drivers of the D quad every time a new Android release comes out and it will be ready to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom Huawei chipset is still somewhat of a mystery in terms of specs (the GPU maker is unknown as well as the core architecture), but the performance is obviously there. We guess we'll be able to find more about it in the coming months as the monstrous smartphone nears launch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend D1 is, for the most part, identical to its more powerful sibling. It has the same HD screen and the same design, it even uses the same materials for the finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way to tell the Ascend D1 apart from the D quad is the paintjob at the back, which mimics carbon fiber here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the biggest difference is under the hood - Huawei Ascend D1 comes with a TI OMAP 4460 chipset, which has two Cortex A9 cores, clocked at 1.5GHz and no fancy 16-core GPU. Of course, performance is still more than adequate, but you can sense the difference if you use the two Ascend smartphones side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascent duo certainly looks set to give the big guys a run for their money. The company says they are going to price their smartphones about 15-20% lower than competitors and it appears that won't come at the cost of user experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D lte<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know what?s better than having two hot smartphones to announce at the mobile industry?s largest event? That's right, three hot smartphones. Enter the Huawei Ascend D lte ? a slim dual-core smartphone with 4G network support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Android version is what powers this thing and even though it lacks a quad-core CPU, the Snapdragon S4 chipset based on the new Krait architecture packs a similar punch and is more power-efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend D lte units we tried didn?t look nearly as final as the D quad phones, but they still felt reasonably smooth. Once again there was little to be found in terms of UI customizations and it was all stock Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Carriers, which have their LTE networks ready or plan to launch them in the near future will certainly want to take a closer look at this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pieces of the Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD puzzle are finally starting to fall in place and the device is shaping up as quite a treat. The FullHD screen has impressive image quality and the quad-core CPU underneath makes sure there are no performance issues, despite the increased resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad 10 FHD is certainly the best built of the newly introduced Huawei devices. The slate uses an aluminum unibody and is extremely slim, which gives it awesome handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating the Android 4.0.3 was smooth and the new ICS browser feels right at home on the large high-res screen. Gaming was impressive too, but at this stage there are very few titles that can make use of the full resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend P1 S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P1 S lineup is not actually new, but we just couldn?t keep our hands off the marvelously slim waistlines and AMOLED-hot touchscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The series flagship ? the 6.68mm thick Ascend P1 S is undoubtedly the most impressive of the bunch. The moment you hold the smartphone in your hand and look at the ultra-deep blacks of its screen, you know that it?s a great piece of equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn?t quite find our way around the Huawei custom launcher as easily as we would have liked, but maybe we just needed to spend more time with it. At least the performance seemed quite fluid, which is probably in part due to the fact that the P series uses qHD screens, rather than 720p units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting thing to note here is the two P1 S versions that we handled used completely different materials on their back panels. The pink one used some glossy plastic that felt and looked a bit cheap, whereas the black one had its rear made of a nice rubberized material, which felt great to touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend P1 lte<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you don?t insist on having the slimmest smartphone possible, you might want to check out the Ascend P1 lte. At 10.5mm, the 4G-enabled smartphone doesn?t feel nearly as sophisticated as its S sibling, but it?s actually the better-spec?d one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-core Krait CPU should supply all the oomph you need and the fastest network data transfers possible. A 2000 mAh battery should keep things going for quite a while.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend P1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 is the most modest package, but it might turn out to be the one with the most potential. A 7.7mm slim ICS-running, 1.5 GHz dual-core smartphone with a qHD AMOLED screen and a pretty decent camera doesn't sound bad, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can imagine it will be cheaper to manufacture, as there are no extremes reached this time, so Huawei will get the chance to price the Ascend P1 rather competitively.</paragraph>
