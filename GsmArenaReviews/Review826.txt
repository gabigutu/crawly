			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is a living legend for its razor thin bezels but it's time to pass on the torch. The compactness spell worked once again and the LG G3 fits a massive 5.5" QHD screen in a body that's barely bigger than that of its competitors. Who need phablets when you can have a phone like the G3?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The LG G3 is finally officially announced</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another trick LG is repeating from last year is to launch later than its chief competitors, so it can have a technological advantage. If the QHD screen (1,440 x 2,560px) isn't enough, the 13MP OIS camera with a LG's proprietary new laser auto focus should tingle your "future tech" sensory organs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G3 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is the first smartphone (or phablet from that matter) from the established makers that hits the QHD screen resolution mark. The sharpness may sound over the top, but LG claims this is what it takes to achieve print-like quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 possesses a spectacular screen-to-body-size-ratio. Keep in mind the Sony Xperia Z2 measures 146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2mm, while the HTC One (M8) is 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4 mm. And those two have only 5.2" and 5" screens respectively. It's the total size that distinguishes the phablet from a regular smartphone, not the screen size. And in this respect the LG G3 is still on regular smartphone territory even though it has a screen that's as big as the one in the LG G Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Note II phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony and Samsung went with big camera sensors, but neither managed to implement OIS. Even HTC dropped it from its new flagship camera, leaving the LG G3 to contend with only the Nokia Lumia 930. The new Korean super star has a 13MP shooter with 2160p video capture and a one-of-a-kind laser focus. It accurately measures distances even in the dark so you'll get fast, accurate focus even for low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera magic extends to the front-facing shooter too - designed for the selfie generation it has a 77° lens and a 2MP sensor with larger pixels and brighter lens than the main camera. It will also light the screen a carefully chosen color to make sure your face is well lit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While LG didn't reuse the self-healing plastic from the G Flex, the LG G3 body is molded from a brand new material with metallic looks that is both scratch and fingerprint resistant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG's smartphone design has become synonymous with razor-thin bezels and the LG G3 doesn't disappoint. In fact, it greatly impresses by just how much screen it manages to fit inside a relatively compact body. We say relatively because the G3 is not a mini by any means, but 5.5" devices so far have been unanimously bigger than this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This minimalistic approach leaves little to adorn the front. There is just a small panel of plastic with brushed metal finish below the screen and a small sliver of black for the earpiece and sensor array above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, while the back and sides are made by a scratch-resistant polycarbonate. It has a film with a metallic finish and it hides fingerprints quote well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At launch the LG G3 will be available in the de facto industry standards of White, Black and Gold colors, along with Red and Violet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The LG G3 will be available in black, white, gold, red and violet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're focusing on the back, LG reused their idea of having all the hardware keys there (power and volume).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The material used for the back is another thing of interest. LG has produced a polycarbonate plastic that looks like having a metallic finish, but it feels likes plastic nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is right above the button assembly. On one side of it is the dual-LED flash and on the other the so-called laser focus sensor. It's actually an IR LED, but we'll get back to the technical details of the camera later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a second IR LED too, this one is on top and it is used for remote control duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't any room for stereo speakers up front (we've seen how those can affect the height of the device with HTC's devices), so LG left the speaker on the back. It's a single speaker but a powerful one - normally it puts out 1W of sound, however with the boost feature this grows to 1.5W. The company compared this to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 speaker, which is rated at 0.7W. They also claim that the speaker amplifier has been reworked since the LG G Pro 2 and it now allows for an even better sound experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG made a conscious decision not to make the G3 water resistant. The design team felt IP ratings mislead consumers about just how much they can put the device through, which has the potential to lead to trouble. Plus, they didn't want any pesky caps covering the ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another decision LG explained is the lack of USB 3.0 port - "big and unattractive" says the company, rarely used to its full potential, too, we might add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is powered by a 3,000mAh battery, which works with a number of software power saving features to prolong battery life. Wireless charging will be available as well, although only as an optional feature. The battery is removable too, for those who like to carry a spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery should also live longer in terms of cycles, since LG replaced the traditional metal with carbon ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For this generation, LG went all out both in terms of size and resolution. At 5.5" the True-HD IPS+ display leaps ahead of direct competitors and threatens phablets like the Galaxy Note 3. LG is boasting that 76.4% of the front is covered by screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The increase in diagonal also made it necessary to bump up the resolution. QHD resolution (1,440 x 2,560) may sound like overkill, but LG looked at the densities at which magazines and art books are printed and wanted a display that can match them in terms of visual acuity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From our short experience with the smartphone, when looking the the user interface, the higher resolution of the screen is not obvious at all. However, when you open a high-quality image in the gallery, the positive difference in the available detail compared to say, the LG G Pro 2, which we have handy, is easily noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution increases always come hand in hand with worries of increased battery life, but the screen controller used in the LG G3 reportedly consumes the same amount of power as a 1080p controller. The UI refresh rate is also constantly adapting to minimize power usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has another super power, too. Thanks to changes in the production process, the digitizer should continue to work even if you crack the screen badly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The LG QuickCircle case<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Circle case was announced a bit earlier than the G3 itself. At the G3 unveiling event we got our first chance of seeing what the circle UI looks like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is powered by a Snapdragon 801 chipset and runs the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Note that the G3 comes in two versions - one with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage and one with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. Both have microSD card slots, but having an extra gig of RAM might just push some people to buy the pricier 32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The new LG UI on the G3 (left) compared to the older style (right)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG applied its own software customizations and we're pleased to announce the end result is a much more attractive flat design. LG was particularly proud of how mature the colors and icons of the interface feel (previous LG skins have traditionally been bright, colorful and skeumorphic).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>See a video of the LG G3 user interface and camera features in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 also features Knock On (tap to wake), which is quickly growing in popularity among users. Knock Code allows you to make this unlock method secure by designing your own sequence of three to eight taps (there are 80,000 variations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That and a few other features are part of what LG calls Smart Security. Content Lock hides sensitive files and photos, so you don't have to worry about lending your G3 to a friend. This feature works for files in the internal memory and on the microSD card, it will even block access to the files if you hook up the LG G3 to a computer using 128-bit encryption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kill Switch is the third security feature. It allows you to remotely disable the phone and in case you can't recover it, delete all the data on it. What makes Kill Switch different from Android Device Manager is that it also performs antivirus scans (the Google Play Store already has a similar feature).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Optimus UI software features two new additions, Smart Notice and Smart Bulletin. Smart Notice is similar to Google Now, it uses clever algorithms to provide timely, relevant information based on the status of the phone, your behavior and location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, it will check your call history and remind you of missed calls or offer to turn the Wi-Fi back on when you arrive at the office. It will even manage your storage by offering to delete apps and files you haven't used in months and advise you to take an umbrella if it's going to rain later that day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Bulletin is LG's rendition of a news reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard was also imbued with new features. Obviously a QWERTY keyboard covering half the 5.5" screen would be too much so the new keyboard simply lets adjust its size. Unfortunately, you cannot do that just by dragging it, you have to go to the Settings to pick one of the several available levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a more detailed look at Smart Notice as well as LG's QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a BlackBerry-esque twist, the keyboard will suggest two words as you type and you can select one of them by swiping up with either your left or right finger. To go back and edit text, you hold down the Space key and then swipe left or right to move the cursor. However clever that is, the keyboard will also try to minimize typos by learning your typing habits.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features and samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 has a 13MP camera with a number of unique features. While the resolution and sensor size are the same as on the G2, LG claims it has enhanced light sensitivity. The camera features optical image stabilization too, OIS+ like on the LG G Pro 2. It's more valuable this year since the competition has left this one out (the new HTC One M8 dropped this feature and Galaxy S5 doesn't have it either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The LG G3 has a 13MP camera with OIS and proprietary Laser focus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Samsung made a big fuss about their phase detection autofocus and how fast it is (and it was indeed fast). LG one up them with three-pronged approach - a traditional contrast focus detection, phase detection focus and the laser focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Laser focus uses a setup borrowed from LG's automatic vacuum cleaners, which needed a way to accurately measure distances. It shines IR light (so not an actual laser, that's just a trade name) in the shape of a cone to get an accurate distance reading even in the dark. Note that this light is not visible to the naked eye and won't show up in the photo either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three focus technologies work simultaneously to shave the autofocus time down to just 276 milliseconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR light used for the laser focus is invisible to the human eye, but it's visible to every regular camera. Here's how it looks on video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera shoots 2.1MP stills but LG says it has a faster lens and bigger pixels than the main camera. Low-light selfies are further enhanced by using the screen as a flash with a carefully tuned color. The camera has a 77° lens, which according to LG is the ideal for selfies. Asian countries in particular will appreciate the victory hand gesture that automatically snaps a selfie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera has an actual flash, a dual-LED, two-tone flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of interface, LG has cleaned up the interface as much as possible so you only need to be concerned with framing your shot, free of distractions. You don't even need to worry about focus - since the new AF is so fast, LG decided to skip the traditional tap to focus and the phone simply gets a focus locks and takes a picture each time you tap the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 camera records 2160p video. LG takes on Nokia here by focusing on an often ignored part of video recording - audio. The LG G3 features several mics, which monitor ambient noise levels and tune the sound accordingly to ensure good audio even in a loud environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to capture a few camera samples with the LG G3. Keep in mind that the unit we used was running an early pre-release version of the software and the final retail units are likely to be noticeably better. This, along with the fact that the lighting conditions were far from ideal, is why we won't be passing any judgment at the time. Instead we'll just let you check out the photos - the first of which was captured in the regular auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the conditions, we found the HDR mode more suitable so we give you a few samples captured with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have a sample from the front-facing camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G3 is running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 MSM8974AC chipset, which brings the Krait 400 CPU clock to 2.5GHz and boosts the GPU speed to 578MHz. That?s the same chipset that powers the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Oppo Find 7 (the other upcoming QHD smartphone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to put the configuration to a test, running several of our favorite benchmarks. Once again we have to remind you though, that the hardware and software of our unit are far from finalized, so the scores we are getting are likely far lower than what the finalized units will achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The LG G3 screen is super sharp and the new UI is eye-pleasing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is a multi-thread CPU benchmark, where the G3 did quite well, achieving one of the best scores we?ve seen so far. It didn?t quite manage to match the Galaxy S5 score, but that?s likely due to the non-finalized score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first compound benchmark we ran was AnTuTu 4 and the LG G3 posted a score very similar to that of the S800 smartphones such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G2. Obviously, the GPU is made to work far harder on the QHD screen, which has 78% more pixels than a 1080p unit but the faster GPU of the Snapdragon 801 chipset has managed to make up for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another benchmark to tests just about every facet of a phone's performance. Impressively enough, the LG G3 manage to outperform the Galaxy Note 3 even in this early stage of its development.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is an integral part to any smartphone experience, so we also subjected the LG G3 to the Kraken JavaScript test. The LG G3 managed to place third here, only trailing the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Apple iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Good or bad, the LG G3 is going to be one of the flagships to reckon with in the next half an year or so ahead. We have already started working on our review, so next week, you should be able to read all about it on our homepage.</paragraph>
