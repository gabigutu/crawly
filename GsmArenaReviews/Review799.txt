			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may be a new house, new rules - but no sharp movements just yet. In the aftermath of Microsoft's recent acquisition of Nokia's devices and services department, it's really anyone's guess what will happen with the Finnish company that was once at the apex of the industry. There's no question marks hanging over the Lumia lineup though - it is going strong, and the Lumia 930 alongside the Windows Phone 8.1 update is proof that it's here to stay, be it under a new leadership.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 930 was released in the US as the Nokia Lumia Icon this past February running Windows Phone 8, and after working the kinks out with the Windows Phone 8.1 update for it, Nokia is launching the international version right to the latest software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides supporting some different LTE bands, the Lumia 930 is identical to the Icon. It does come with some nifty extras, however, as Nokia is trying to entice users by throwing in a wireless charging pad with dedicated A/C adapter, as well as some different paint jobs. Here's a look at what you get with the Nokia Lumia 930:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as recent flagship offerings go, the 930 does leave a bit to be desired. We would have liked to see a more recent Snapdragon 801 chip inside, and the lack of expandable storage and 2160p video recording make the 930 feel like it's falling behind competitors' flagships. Still, Nokia phones have traditionally relied on other strengths to set them apart, and the Lumia 930 may do enough there to give it the edge. There's also the new Windows Phone 8.1 update with Nokia Cyan to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 has finally caught up to the competition and offers some long-awaited features such as Action Center with notification and quick toggles, customizable tile size and Start screen background, the Cortana voice assistant, Quiet Hours mode, and a swipe-able keyboard among many others. We'll get into the details in a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be looking at the updated software interface a bit further on in the review. Up next, we get things underway with our traditional hardware examination, including a look at its stylish metal frame and 1080p ClearBlack AMOLED display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lumia 930<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Lumia Icon, the Lumia 930 offers a robust array of additional extras to entice more followers into Nokia's camp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One such extra is the Wireless Charging Plate DT-900, which also comes with its own A/C adapter. The plate is one of the few around that feature a rubber ring in the middle to prevent the device you're charging from slipping, which is a nice little touch. The plate supports the Qi charging standard - as does the Lumia 930 - so you can charge other Qi-supported devices with it, or use a third party Qi charger to charge the Lumia 930, if need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, one extra that was omitted from the otherwise robust retail package is a headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 stands at 137 x 71 x 9.8mm and weighs 167g. The phone has a 0.5" bigger display compared to its spiritual predecessor, the Lumia 925. It's also 7mm taller, but enjoys roughly the same width and thickness as Nokia's top PureView cameraphone, the Lumia 1020. Without the camera hump, that is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 features an aluminum frame covering the sides of the device, alongside a polycarbonate back panel that can come in a variety of colors, including orange, green, black and white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is covered by Gorilla Glass 3 with a very slight tapered edge. The taper is very subtle, but surprisingly adds immensely to the look of the smartphone, and feels very pleasant to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is of polycarbonate, and comes in up to four colors. It's a bit more prominently tapered toward the edges, resulting in a naturally curved shape for a very comfortable grip. The back panel is nonetheless an odd choice by Nokia, as the plastic feels slightly out of place on the device, and looks like it should be removable but isn't. It somewhat detracts from the build quality, especially when compared to the Nokia Lumia 925.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aforementioned aluminum frame is sharply cornered and provides a different feel to, say, the bulky Nokia Lumia 1020, which has a rounded back panel and sides. The sharper edges feel a little rough in-hand, but not overly so.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930's front is all black glass, with three capacitive buttons located below the display. Above the display is the earpiece next to the front-facing 1.2MP camera, as well as some sensors above the Nokia logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bare left side is complemented by a somewhat crowded right side, where you'll find a volume rocker, power/lock button, and a dedicated shutter key. The shutter key is a classic two-stage with a reasonably distinct half-press for autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Lumia 930 features a centrally-located 3.5mm audio jack next to a high quality microSIM card tray that fits flush with the frame, yet is easily removable. There are two colored strips on either side of the audio jack as an accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we said, the retail package of the Lumia 930 doesn't come with a headset, so you'll have to provide your own to stick into the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom you'll find only the microUSB port flanked by the same colored strips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, on the back you'll find the 20MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss lens, a dual-LED flash, and two microphones. There's also a small loudspeaker grille in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite appearances, the back panel is non-removable, so you won't be able to access the 2,420mAh battery inside without taking it in.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 packs a 5-inch ClearBlack AMOLED display of 1080p resolution. The resulting pixel density of 441ppi is the highest ever for a Nokia Lumia device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that is immediately noticeable is a purplish hue apparent on the display. Fortunately, it is a problem that Microsoft is aware of, and can easily be corrected by going into the display options and using the 'adjust color' option in the display settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once this is fixed, you'll find that colors are very accurate, and viewing angles are also good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a microscopic image of the AMOLED screen's RGB matrix - we've shot it next to the 768 x 1280px AMOLED display of the Nokia Lumia 1020 for comparison's sake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, AMOLED displays have inherently infinite contrast ratios, but we were able to measure the white brightness levels at 50% and 100% luminance. We found to be the panel only slightly dimmer as the one found on the Nokia Lumia 1020, but notably less bright than the Samsung Galaxy S5, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone very well in our sunlight legibility test, beating much more expensive offerings in the process and coming in 4th in our overall Sunlight legibility chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 is powered by a non-removable 2,420mAh battery. Official numbers provided by Nokia list the device as being capable of over 15 hours of 3G talk time and 18 days worth of standby. Naturally, we conducted our own battery test and the results are in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 930's AMOLED display brought disappointing numbers, especially when it came to watching videos and browsing the web. With sub 6 hour times for each, it means that you'll have to have an A/C adapter within arms' reach if you plan on doing a lot of either activity - hardly a practical solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The poor screen-on numbers were compensated somewhat by the excellent figures you get when the screen isn't on. The just under 17 hours of 3G talk time we got was better than the manufacturer supplied numbers, and the standby times were also great, especially considering Nokia has disabled the Glance screen feature in the Lumia 930.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the endurance rating came out to 46 hours, which means that you'll be able to last just under two full days if you do an hour's worth of video playback, calling over a 3G network and web browsing per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 comes with support for quad band GSM, 3G, and LTE networks. Unlike its Lumia Icon twin which came optimized for US networks, the Lumia 930 works on international bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac (that's both 2.4GHz and 5Ghz), and DLNA. There is also stereo Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity lets you share content with other NFC-enabled devices, or you can use NFC and the Wallet app to pay for purchases at participating retailers. You can download a NFC management app from the Windows Store if you'd like to manage NFC tags as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the ability to cast onto a TV, monitor or projector via the dedicated menu in the settings. The internet sharing feature also lets you share content using a specific broadcast name and password.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone 8.1 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 is the latest smartphone to come with Windows Phone 8.1 out of box. The update has already rolled out to Windows Phone 8 devices, and represents the latest that Microsoft has to offer in a mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 brings a plethora of new features and UI improvements, while Lumia Cyan build on that and delivers Nokia's exclusive apps such as the Nokia Camera, Creative Studio, Storyteller, plus it adds some additional options on selected Lumia smartphones, such as Miracast Wireless Display support and Dolby Surround Sound capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into details, here comes our traditional UI walkthrough to get you warmed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start our tour with the lockscreen. The Lumia 930 doesn't offer Glance screen option, which is surprising for a phone of this caliber. Nokia has gone with a cheaper type of AMOLED panel to keep the costs down of the Lumia 930, and it is one that doesn't support Glance. Still, you get the double-tap to unlock option, thanks to the Windows Phone 8.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock your Lumia 930, you'll get to the familiar interface with resizable live tiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under Windows Phone 8.1, you can now select a background image to make some of your live tiles look more uniform. This looks great, except that not all live tiles are transparent, which can detract from the overall effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 8 GDR 3 update introduced the option to pack even more tiles on a row, but the decision for the tile count was only available to the manufacturer. With WP 8.1 you can make up your own mind by going to Settings-&gt;Start + Theme and selecting or deselecting the "Show more Tiles" option. In this way, depending on the size of the tiles, you can have up to six in a row instead of merely four.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the major novelties brought by Windows Phone 8.1 is a unified notification center. Microsoft calls this the Action Center and you access it by pulling down from the top of the screen, just like on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Center lets you access quick toggles as well as various app notifications. You can swipe individual notifications off the screen or you can click the dedicated clean all key to remove them all at once. Sliding down the Action Center also reveals a battery percentage indicator below the battery icon, as well as the date and carrier network below the clock and reception icons, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four toggles at the top are fully customizable. The available options include Airplane mode, Bluetooth, brightness, camera, internet sharing, location, project my screen, quiet hours, rotation lock, VPN, Wi-Fi, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different toggles have different actions, however: a tap on the Wi-Fi button will get you to the Wi-Fi settings menu, while a double-tap on the Bluetooth - won't. It's a somewhat confusing inconsistency and detracts from the overall usability of the toggle system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like on iOS, here you can customize the notifications - you can choose whether banners, sounds and vibration are available for each notification type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft chose Apple's way of handling apps running in background - most of the apps are suspended upon hitting the Windows key and will be resumed once you bring them back. There are others, of course, such as Navigation, Cortana and Battery apps, which will continue to run in background unless you specifically kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quiet Hours mode is pretty much the same as Apple's DND mode - it can be set to block calls and messages over pre-defined time interval, plus it can also go on automatically during events you have marked in your calendar. Just like its competing services, Quiet Hours supports the so-called Inner Circle - the notifications from your Inner Circle will always break through. There is also an option to allow calls from people who call you more than two times in less than three minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synchronization options have been upgraded as well. You can now sync your settings (theme, app settings and data, Internet Explorer tabs and passwords) and push them across all other devices. The service isn't as powerful as on Android or iOS, but it does most of the important stuff and is another step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 doesn't offer a full-featured and system-wide file manager out of the box but Microsoft allow you to download their newly released Files app, which would service the purpose of accessing the storage memory and manage all files stored there regardless of which app they are meant for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone, just like iOS and Android, offers Find My Phone option. If you lose your phone, you can log into WindowsPhone.com with your Microsoft ID and try to locate your phone from there. Ring, lock and wipe options are available as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 has a Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 chipset with four Krait 400 cores clocked at 2.2GHz, Adreno 330 graphics, and 2GB of RAM. It's one of the most capable smartphones Nokia has released next to the Lumia 1520, so we're expecting good numbers compared to other Nokia flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've updated several of the competing Nokia devices to the latest Windows Phone 8.1 build to make sure the playing field is even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test measures the single-core performance by calculating the Number Pi. The Lumia 930 is the best-performing Lumia we've tested in calculating Pi, on par with the similarly-clocked Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pi Benchmark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we got to the compound test AnTuTu. The Lumia 930 again aced this test, showing off some great numbers in overall performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we used the popular cross-platform BaseMark OS II compound benchmark. The Nokia Lumia 930 again scored towards the top of the charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 comes with an updated Internet Explorer 11 web browser that brings lots of new goodies and... you guessed it, performance improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider measures the JavaScript rendering performance of the web browser. The Lumia 930 again comes in at the top alongside the Lumia 1520 running Windows Phone 8.1. The latter performed better after the update than before, which shows that the optimizations Microsoft added in Windows 8.1, and the updated Internet Explorer make a difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we put the phones through the standard HTML5Test and the entire gang showed similar bump in its HTML5 capabilities, courtesy of IE11.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTML 5 Test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our benchmarks show that the Lumia 930 is undeniably the best-performing Nokia device to date, even topping the Lumia 1520 in certain tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Cortana at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cortana, which premiered with Windows Phone 8.1, is Microsoft's answer to Siri, S Voice and Google Now. It does a pretty good job with voice recognition and it has the potential of helping you out on a number of occasions throughout your day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana is very similar to Siri. The voice comes courtesy of Halo's Jen Taylor and is probably the most human-like sounding virtual assistant we've encountered. It recognizes your voice commands and questions in natural human language and provides voice feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what can Cortana actually do for you? First you need to personalize it in order to utilize its full potential. The Settings are called Notebook and are divided into Interests, Reminders, Quiet Hours, Inner Circle, Places, and Music Searches. In Interests you can assign literally everything you like and Cortana will help you track specific news, plan trips, find restaurants or bars, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana supports reminders including people-based ones - you can tell her to remind you of something next time you call some of your contacts. It also supports reminders by location (home, work, university, stores), so it can remind you to wish a coworker a happy birthday before starting with the work-related questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can also remember places, important people to you (it can even suggest such people based on your activity), plus it can actively control your quiet hours mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can fully interact with your phone and carry out all kind or commands related to it - make a call, send a message, add appointments, take notes, set alarms, play specific music or playlists, navigate you to locations or simply search the web. It can also turn on/off settings or give you straightforward answers to simple questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana is also capable of checking the traffic in your city and it will remind you to leave early or warn you if your bus or train has been delayed. It can also provide alternatives routes to avoid traffic jams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unique among virtual assistants, Cortana can also forward your commands to third party apps, so you can for example ask it to open Skype and call some of your contacts. Only Skype, Facebook and Twitter currently support this functionality, but others should follow sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the speed of voice recognition is concerned, WP's virtual assistant does a fine job. Words are recognized almost in real time, and the accuracy has greatly improved since its earlier iterations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can do a lot more than Cortana today, while Google Now with its automatically appearing cards is probably the most useful of the bunch, but those two have quite a head start. Microsoft does remind you that Cortana is still in beta, so we expect even better performance and functionality once it's finalized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd also like to see Cortana hitting other regions and languages as the US is the only supported one for now. The good news is you can bypass that limitation by simply changing your region in the settings menu - no complicated hacks required.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People Hub - your socialized phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the phonebook that you'll find on the Lumia 930, and is one of the more capable such applications we've seen. It supports multiple accounts, including social ones, and has multiple pages like the rest of the WP interface. The first page is your contacts list, the second one is What's New with all of your friends' social updates, then come (chat) Rooms, and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the People app, viewing a single contact also allows you to check this specific person's social updates plus you can view the complete history of exchange with this contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me tile is also available, which acts as your collective social hub - you can see all of your social updates here, post statuses across all services, and even a check-in option is available. You can send IMs to your Facebook/Twitter friends from the Me app, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony integrates with Skype<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone application on the Lumia 930 shows you call history with call duration, courtesy of the WP 8.1 update. There are shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. Smart dial is not supported, but you can use Cortana to dial someone in a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One new feature you'll notice in the in-call screen is the Skype button. If you hit it, your call will be automatically transferred into a free Skype video chat. Of course, the other user must have a Skype client installed plus an active internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 930 scored a Very Good mark, so having missed calls or notifications are unlikely in all but the loudest environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Learn more about the loudspeaker text here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging hub has two new options - a shortcut to go to the contact's full details in People Hub, plus a setting to mute the thread. If you choose Mute, then you'll stop receiving any notifications for incoming messages from this number, though the messages will still be saved in the thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. As a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages. That's one thing we love about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client has very simple interface but it offers everything an email client should feature - support for multiple accounts, threaded view, batch operations, search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linked Inbox is available too - you can link all of your mail boxes into a single one from the Outlook app's settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While retaining the same looks, the virtual keyboard now supports Wordflow - a Swype-like input method allowing you to quickly input words without lifting your finger by swiping through the letters. It is extremely accurate and recently managed to set a new Guinness Record for typing on a virtual keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simplified Photos app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In Windows Phone 8.1 the Photo Hub has lost the magazine UI in favor of the traditional WP page view. You get three swipe-able pages - all, albums and favorites - all pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic OneDrive backup is available, you just need to enable it from the settings. Microsoft gives you 7GB for free plus 3GB for the each device on which you turn on the automatic OneDrive camera upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, messaging, email, Facebook, OneDrive and other available social services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox music app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default Xbox music player in Windows Phone 8.1 uses the familiar page layout - you get Now Playing page; Collection view with shortcuts to artists, albums, songs, genres, playlists, and Music Store highlights. It also allows you to create, edit and delete playlists straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is compatible with your Xbox Music account and can stream your songs if you have active connection without saving them on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately The Music app doesn't support WAV or FLAC playback. There are no equalizer options either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player comes with limited subtitle support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is a separate app called Video. It has a four-page layout - your collection, movie store, TV store and spotlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player supports XviD, DivX, MOV and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is a limited subtitles support, but you have to put both the video file and subtitles in a separate folder within the default Video folder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio with RDS support on board the Lumia 930. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 is a not the loudest performer we've seen in our audio quality test. It's about average when connected to an active external amplifier and worse than the average when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the clarity of the output is concerned, the Nokia smartphone did well in the first part of our test, posting pretty good scores, although short of some competing flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones adds a fair amount of stereo crosstalk, and quite a lot of intermodulation distortion for an overall underwhelming performance. These are not the kind of flaws an average user will be able to detect in real use cases, but they might matter to extreme audiophiles armed with overly expensive headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>20MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss optics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 comes with a 20MP PureView shooter with Carl Zeiss lens. If you're unfamiliar with Nokia's PureView technology, it's a feature that the company debuted as a way to increase image fidelity by downscaling the 20MP images to 5MP .JPEGs by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has created a proprietary app for all Lumia smartphones called Nokia Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The (Nokia) camera interface is very familiar - it offers white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed up to 1s and exposure settings. Expanding the top settings menu puts the camera in Pro mode, which lets you adjust such things as ISO, exposure, shutter speed, white balance, and more, via a nifty slider interface that pops up on the right side of the frame. Your adjustments show up real-time so you can easily set up the exact shot parameters that you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting 19MP samples on the Lumia 930 are of high quality, with accurate exposure and colors. There were minimal traces of noise or overly-aggressive de-noising filters, which means that you get crisp images without having to sacrifice anything. Corner-to-corner sharpness is excellent. The white balance sometimes strays into the red and green channels, but is for the most part it is spot on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also 5MP PureView samples, which is the default shooting mode of the Lumia 930. They are identical to the 19MP samples, but downscaled to 5MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can get more camera functionality via Lenses. Our Lumia 930 came only with Bing Vision, Vine and Twitter modes, but you can also download numerous other free and paid lenses which enhance the camera functionality. Highlights include Nokia Cinemagraph, Panorama, and Refocus lenses, but there's a whole bunch more that can be downloaded directly from the lenses interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 930 also has a macro shooting mode called close-up, which provides some very good results when shooting in nature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the Lumia 930 to provide you with 19MP .DNG raw images, if you want to perform some advanced post-processing of your own. Here's a sample (you will need a viewer that supports RAW files).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've added the Nokia Lumia 930 to our dedicated photo compare tool, where you can compare its 20MP shooter to other smartphone flagships. You can also see how its 5MP PureView samples stack up from within the tool's interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 930 camcorder can record video at 1080p@30fps, with a solid 19Mbps bitrate and an unwavering 30fps. By default, videos are recorded with dual-channel AAC audio at 256 Kbps, but you can also enable Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 recording, which will up the bitrate to 384 Kbps and record in six channels under the AC3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is pretty much the same as the still camera. It offers only white balance and manual focus settings, and also allows you to choose the audio bass filter (off, 100 Hz or 200 Hz). Opting for 200 Hz (Strong) will capture much better sound in concerts or clubs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video recording, the Lumia 930 doesn't perform as well as when shooting still images. The level of detail in 1080p videos is not comparable, and the dynamic range isn't as good either. Otherwise, the colors are still accurate, and there are no issues with white balance or contrast, either. There were some issues with the autofocus, however, as the camcorder keeps refocusing on certain moving objects in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 30s sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Also here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video for you to download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer 11 is your web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer 11 is the newest version of the Microsoft's mobile web browser. You bet it went through an extensive upgrade and is a marked improvement over previous versions. IE 11 is what the Windows Phone browser should have been from the get-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft took several cues from the competition and now provides private browsing, reader mode, unlimited tab support with new UI, saving passwords, tab and bookmark sync across devices and support for inline videos to name a few. Back and Forward gestures have been added too - just swipe from the left or right edge of the screen. Yes, just like in iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first new feature you'll notice is the unlimited tab support in IE 11. The tab manager has a new UI too, plus a dedicated shortcut right next to the address bar. InPrivate browsing is available too, you can launch a separate incognito tab from the tab manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open an article on the web you'll notice a small book icon appearing in the address bar. If you tap it you'll activate the so-called Reader mode. It does the same as its iOS namesake - it strips down everything but the article itself and its pictures. This way you can enjoy seamless reading of long articles without any unnecessary content or ads. You can configure the Reader background color and font size from the IE 11 settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 also supports inline video playback. In case the browser is capable of playing an embedded video, you will be able to do it right from within the article. No external players or pop ups are needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like its Android and iOS counterparts, the new web browser supports tab and bookmark sync across devices. This means you can start exactly where you left off on IE on Windows PC or slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way you can pin web pages to your start screen. You'll get a Live Tile, which will show the latest updates to this website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important upgrade in IE 11 is the option to remember passwords and sync them to other devices. You no longer need to type in the same usernames and passwords over and over again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer 11 web browser, just like the overall UI, seems to be faster, with excellent page loading times and scrolling performance. We've enjoyed the new version and we think you'll like it too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document/Excel/PowerPoint viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. OneDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through OneDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, and you can add photos and voice memos or send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your OneDrive as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code them to make them easier to tell apart. It offers day and agenda views for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weekly view makes the days expandable in case you have more events than the small square can show. This mode even searches for weather forecast and displays it with small icons on each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Lumia 930 comes with Alarm, Calculator, and Weather apps pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Travel, Sports, Finance, Food &amp; Drinks and News apps are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Lumia 930 you get a few Nokia exclusive apps - Storyteller interactive diary, Creative Studio for advanced photo enhancements, and, of course, HERE Maps and HERE Drive+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive+ offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone's traditional Games app is present - it carries over many features from the similar Xbox profile - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. It is also your gaming hub - here you can find all of your pre-installed games, spotlight news and store links.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Windows Phone 8.1 introduced a couple of new apps: Storage Sense and Battery Saver. Storage Sense tracks your internal memory and allows you to configure which content will be saved where. Battery Saver now not only shows you the battery percentage and allows you to configure when the battery saver goes on, but it can now track battery usage too. You can also allow or restrict apps to run in the background while the battery saver is turned on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Microsoft Store now supports automatic app updates. You can choose whether those happen only when connected to a Wi-Fi network, or if cellular data is allowed as well. Check for updates button is available, but now the Store checks for available updates quite a few times a day, so you probably won't need to use this key regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 on the Lumia 930 supports motion data collection in the background. This process runs on the background and collects data to track your movement and location. Supposedly, this won't affect battery life. It's a useful feature for fitness fans and can be used by various health-related apps including the pre-installed Health and Fitness app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Never mind the minor numerical difference from the Lumia 925, the Nokia Lumia 930 is a whole new step ahead for Windows Phone. With a pocketable size, Nokia's trademark design language and capable camera alongside Microsoft's latest Windows Phone 8.1 update and the best benchmark performance we've seen from a Nokia device yet, it's perhaps Nokia's most all-round solid offering to date. But is that enough?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Competition in the smartphone market is fierce to say the least. Capable Android offerings from the likes of Sony, Samsung, LG, and Oppo, among others, offer robust Snapdragon 801 processors, expandable storage, larger displays, premium build, and even QHD displays and 2160p video recording. All those Android trump cards already in play raise the question of whether Nokia's best is good enough to compete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 8.1 brought with it a slew of improvements on the software side - you get a new notification area Action center, virtual assistant, and some nifty visual improvements, but these are, after all, things that their Android and iOS competitors have had generations to perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Lumia 1020, many would say that Nokia did enough to outdo the Android and iOS crowd by introducing arguably the most capable smartphone camera to date (one that still hasn't been topped). The Lumia 930 has plenty of things that it does well, but nothing that exactly sets it apart like its 41MP sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's camera software is one area where it's still very strong, and Windows Phone's robust selection of camera 'lenses' greatly enhance the performance of the 20MP shooter. The ClearBlack AMOLED helps make the primarily black Windows Phone interface look that much better, but we weren't impressed with the battery life that suffered greatly during screen-on activities like web browsing and watching videos. Still, the Lumia 930 is the most powerful Windows Phone to date, and the high quality design language make it a great purchase if you've got your heart set on a WP device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in the US, the Lumia 930 is available as the Lumia Icon for Verizon (previously known as Lumia 929).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 930 ? Nokia Lumia Icon</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia does have a few other offerings available that don't have the drawbacks of the Lumia 930. The Nokia Lumia 1520 has largely the same performance found on the 930 due to its identical chipset and processor. Thanks to its robust 3,400mAh battery, it almost triples the battery life, and there's a microSD card slot to build upon the internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera performance is on par as the 1520 has the same 20MP/1.2MP front-rear camera combo, but you're also looking at a much larger device due to its 6-inch diagonal. The aluminum frame is also gone, which means that you'll have to settle for a simpler, more rounded polycarbonate design aesthetic as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia's Lumia 1020 and its robust 41MP camera is a photographer's paradise, and is the go-to device if you're looking for a capable camera to go with your smartphone. It's a more compact device thanks to its 4.5-inch diagonal, but is nonetheless thicker due to its protruding camera module. The display is not as sharp at 768 x 1280px resolution, and you won't get as good a performance out of the slower 1.5GHz dual-core Krait CPU with Adreno 225 graphics. Battery life is more acceptable, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it doesn't have to be Windows Phone, HTC's One (M8) flagship is another offering with a 5-inch 1080p screen and premium build quality. The M8's all-metal unibody is superior to that of the Lumia 930, and you get expandable storage, an IR-port, and a larger 2,600mAh battery to boot. The M8 is at a serious disadvantage in the camera department, however, and the droid will also be more expensive than the Lumia 930 in most markets. The other top droids fetch an even higher premium - but then again, you'll be getting 2160p videos and even a couple of QHD screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 is undoubtedly one of Nokia's top offerings, which is particularly significant considering the message it sends. The Nokia spirit still lives after the Microsoft acquisition. The Lumia 930 isn't in the best position, being the first flagship following the transition, but what's more significant is that even at its best, a Lumia flagship stops just short of matching its Android peers. The WP8.1 update is certainly a step in the right direction, but one question still looms: what if Nokia had gone with Android?</paragraph>
