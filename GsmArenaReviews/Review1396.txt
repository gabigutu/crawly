			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What?s better than a tasty Cookie? We?ll tell you what ? two of those. The guest duet Cookie Lite T300 and Cookie 3G T320 have completely different designs but almost identical specifications. Both handsets target the young audience and go under the ?fun? slogan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie 3G T320 is slightly better than the Lite T300 in terms of screen, camera and connectivity. Here?s how:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Cookie 3G T320 over the Cookie Lite T300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite their low price, the LG Cookie Lite T300 and the Cookie 3G T320 have put their best foot forward and come with shiny and elegant outfits. The smaller Cookie comes in a full glossy black body, while its 3G sibling has a unique orange back. Both phones pack 3.5 mm audio jacks, which combined with the microSD slot and the decent music player make them excellent portable MP3 players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social factor is not forgotten and the Cookie duo has preinstalled application supporting universal Facebook, MySpace and Twitter access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, there is another Cookie between those two ? the Cookie Style T310. Its specs are similar with the Lite T300, but has 0.4-inch bigger screen. Wi-Fi-enabled versions are also available in some markets under the names of Wink Style T310 or Cookie WiFi T310i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's get back to the Cookies in our jar. Our hardware inspection starts right after the jump, followed by a glimpse into the software side of things.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Cookie T300 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic LG Cookie T300 measures 95.8 x 50.5 x 11.9 mm and weighs 77 grams. It looks even slimmer than the numbers will tell you because of its all-gloss black body and tapered edges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Cookie Lite T300 design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The plastic construction of the Cookie Lite T300 certainly helps it keep its weight down to a svelte 77 grams. The entire surface is glossy and this definitely does not help fend off fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" display takes center stage on the T300 front. Its image quality isn't anything to shout about, but it?s understandable for a budget phone with a small screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie Lite T300 uses a resistive technology for its display, which is another thing that will keep the price low. Still the touch sensitivity is quite good, detecting almost all of our finger requests accurately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece - there's no ambient light sensor to adjust the brightness of the display. Below the screen there are three hardware keys - two receiver keys on each side of the Back button. The Call and End keys have a distinct and audible click when pressed. Right next to the Back key is the tiny mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie Lite T300's right side houses the volume rocker, accompanied by the microSD slot. The latter is covered by a small plastic cap. The lanyard eyelet is on the top left side, followed by the microUSB connectivity port with protective plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features the unprotected 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock combo. The bottom is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover houses only the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 900 mAh Li-Ion battery. From the official statement we should expect 500 hours of stand-by or 8 hours of talk-time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the LG Cookie Lite T300 is a pleasingly compact touchscreen phone. It's not the slimmest around, but the ergonomic design more than makes up for that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Cookie T320 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic LG Cookie 3G T320 measures 103 x 57 x 11.9 mm and weighs 92.5 grams. The youthful orange back suits the Cookie 3G quite well and we?re sure many people will appreciate it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Cookie 3G T320 design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie 3G T320 looks much like a bigger version of Cookie T300. Fortunately, it doesn?t use glossy plastic, making it much less of a fingerprint magnetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is taken up by the 2.8" 256K-color display of 240 x 320 pixel resolution. It doesn?t have a stylus as the original Cookie, but the screen sunlight legibility is way behind the best examples on the market much like on most other LG touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG Cookie 3G T320 again resembles the KP500 Cookie with the three hardware buttons below the screen. Those include a Call and an End key on either side of the Back key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only control on the right-hand side of the Cookie 3G T320 is the volume rocker, which serves as a digital zoom lever in the camcorder (2x max) and the image gallery too. The microUSB connectivity port covered with a plastic lid is the other companion here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite side houses only the microSD card slot, also covered by a protective plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to its Cookie T300 sibling, the T320?s top side features the unprotected 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock combo. The bottom is completely bare again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera lens is the sole inhabitant of the LG Cookie 3G T320?s back. We really like the orange paint on the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is a breeze ? you simply slide down to release. Underneath is the 900 mAh Li-Ion battery. The LG Cookie 3G is said to offer up to 4 h of talk time and up to 530 h of standby time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy with the ergonomics of the LG Cookie 3G T320. We should also point out the very good build quality: it's an all-plastic piece of gear but is solid and quite durable and the surfaces (except the screen) are fingerprint-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie 3G is not the thinnest handset around, but it remains compact and offers a secure hand hold. Operating with it is also exceptionally comfortable, which is good enough in our books.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple cartoon user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Lite T300 and 3G T320 are well dressed in terms of software too. Both have a similar user interface, which borrows most of the LG GD510 Pop UI ? a Cookie interface at heart with a few eye-catching homescreens on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface most resembles the Cartoon UI in the first Samsung S3650 Corby. The main menu is a 3x3 grid of cartoon or S-Class (theme depending) icons and is page organized. Unfortunately, when you dig deeper you?ll discover the standard LG interface we know from all non-S-Class devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie duo has two cartoon-styled homescreens, but not in the usual sense of one extended desktop. It has two kinds of homescreen, though you get only one at a time and they are non-scrollable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the Widget-enabled screen that allows you to arrange several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widget tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or stash the ones you don't need back in the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets available on both LG Cookie Lite T300 and 3G T320 include two clocks (analog and a dual time zone piece), a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a weather widget, notes app, image slideshow, a calendar, Pocket Apps, a Social-networking widget and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the second homescreen you sweep your finger sideways across the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact homescreen doesn't work with widgets, but lets you arrange up to eight favorite contact icons instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the rest of the UI is pretty much what you?ll find in every non-S-Class LG device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few quick words about the telephony and messaging. Both the Cookie Lite T300 and the Cookie 3G T320 have good reception and the in-call sound is loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support Smart dialing, but it only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you typed. This just isn't of much use since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they have their names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call the screen is locked ? you have to unlock it manually as there?s no proximity sensor to take care of that automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging department on both devices is fairly straightforward. You can choose between an on-screen keypad in portrait or a QWERTY keyboard in landscape (Cookie 3G T320 only) and there?s handwriting recognition too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the LG Cookie Lite T300 and Cookie 3G T320 for day-to-day telephony was fine in both cases. Here's how they rank in our loudspeaker test:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Lite T300 and 3G T320 have a feature-full music player. There is nice Album Art and lots of equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG Cookie T300/T320 music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player: by artist, album, genre, and recently played or you can create custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background. You can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated mini player widget. When you?re not using the widget (that is, it?s in the tray), a semitransparent strip appears near the top of the homescreen (all three of them) that shows the artist and track name. That strip just shows info, it cannot control the player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Lite T300/Cookie 3G T320 comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when you minimize the FM radio you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie duo offers an extra feature ? FM radio recording. You can choose the storage type, but not the quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two small cameras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Lite T300 boasts an 1.3 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 1280x960 pixels, while the Cookie 3G T320 sports a 2 megapixel camera capable of shooting at maximum of 1600x1200 pixels. Both have no flash of any kind, so low-light photography is not really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie T300/T320 camera interface is similar to the one on the LG Pop and Cookie Gig. You can access all camera settings via a toolbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for zooming, exposure and an advanced settings key (resolution, white balance, color effects, continuous shot, etc.). This left toolbar auto hides when not used and you need to tap on the screen to bring it back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the LG Cookie T300/T320 viewfinder is another bar with a virtual shutter key that also slides up and down to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside you can find the gallery button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Lite T300 produces noisy images, which certainly lack much detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Cookie 3G T320 camera doesn?t work properly on our unit and we can?t provide you with any samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is similar to the still camera one. The Cookie T300 and T320 capture QCIF@15fps videos, which are useful only when viewed on the phone.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Cookies are LG?s budget lineup and both the T300 and T320 fit in perfectly there. The smaller Cookie Lite is an excellent youth-oriented phone offering touchscreen interaction, Cartoon UI and quick social networking access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie 3G T320 boosts the youthful experience even further with 3G connectivity, 0.4? bigger screen and slightly better camera. Despite the cool upgrades, it manages to keep its price relatively low and will win the hearts of many users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both handsets are intended to be cheap and simple yet capable of handling most user demands. The 3.5mm audio jack plus the microSD card will also be appreciated by the music maniacs, going to show that LG packed these phones with lots of hidden power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked those two fellas and we?re sure you?ll like them too. The Cookie line has always been about fun, not business, and the Cookie duet here does fun really well.</paragraph>
