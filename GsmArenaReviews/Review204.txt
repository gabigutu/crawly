			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung focused this year's IFA solely on its smart wearables and introduced the Samsung Gear S3. It's a smartwatch that improves on both halves of its name - it looks and feels much more like a traditional watch, while functionality is on par with a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S3 is powered by Tizen - Samsung's Linux-based platform that doesn't get much love on phones but shines on your wrist. It's detached from Google's gradual process of adding new features, allowing the Gears to be a step ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has created two versions - Classic and Frontier. They are mostly identical, though the latter earns its name with its more adventurous nature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another distinction is Wi-Fi only and 3G/LTE. The watches now come with a speaker and a microphone as standard, so they can handle voice calls - the watch can make the call itself or just serve as a hands-free for your phone. Note that only the Gear S3 frontier will have a 3G/LTE version. If you want Wi-Fi only, you can pick between the frontier and classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung did a lot to make the watch more independent from the phone too, with the Gear S3 you'll rarely have an occasion where you have to take your phone out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Samsung Gear S2 will not be discontinued since Samsung thinks it and the new S3 will appeal to different audiences. Size is the defining factor - despite the small difference in screen size (S3: 1.3", S2: 1.2"), the new Gear S3 is much bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing: right now, the watches are only compatible with Android phones, but iOS-support is in open beta in Korea (there's no ETA, however).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S3 Classic and Frontier - the hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People started wearing watches for practical reasons, but the humble wristwatch eventually morphed into a piece of jewelry where looks trump function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps that's why many stopped wearing watches when phones took over as the vanity item to have. Others stand by the classic watch and for them most smartwatches don't cut it - they just look too gadgety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung addressed this by building the Gear S3 like a classic watch. It used durable 316L stainless steel - a material commonly used in luxury watches that need to hold up to corrosion inflicted by seawater, chlorine and acids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, both S3 watches are waterproof with an IP68 rating. IP ratings don't cover swimming in the sea (salt water), even chlorinated pools aren't safe enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung went a step further than IP and even showed resistance to extreme temperatures - one Gear S3 was dunked in a freezing bath with dry ice, another was half buried in sand and under a heat lamp. So, be it a mountain top or a desert sand dune, the S3 is with you all the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ruggedness is helped by Gorilla Glass SR+, specifically designed for wearables. It has lower reflection and better damage resistance (reducing visible scratches) than a typical glass. Samsung says it's almost as tough as sapphire, while Corning is more restrained in its claims (well, this batch of SR+ is specifically cooked up for Samsung, so maybe it has a secret ingredient).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to make the distinction. The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier comes with rubber bands and a bezel with notches and numbers. It's a subtle difference, but the numbers make it look like a dive watch. Also, its buttons are wide, flat and grippy - perfect for wet hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S3 Classic has a clean bezel and traditional round buttons. There's two of them - Top is Back, Bottom is Home - the rotating bezel handles fine-grained selection. It can also answer/reject calls by rotating it left/right, great for gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two watches are identical in size (46.1mm in diameter, 13mm thick), but the Frontier weighs a bit more (62g vs. 57g, both without the band). They both have a two-tone design - matte top and shiny sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of size, the Gear S3 is noticeably larger than the S2 - one of the biggest smartwatches we've handled. The screen isn't that big, 1.3" (up from 1.2" on the S2), but the bezel does add plenty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major difference between Classic and Frontier is color and bands. The Classic comes only in Silver and with Leather bands, Frontier only in Black and with Rubber bands. Unexpectedly, we liked the feel of the rubber bands better, the leather ones are too rigid. The black color was more to our taste as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watches use standard 22mm bands and are easy to swap - the Samsung rep did it in front of us in under a minute.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S3 Classic and Frontier - the features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there are two complaints about smartwatches, they are looks and battery life. We already covered the looks, but there's plenty to say about the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start some way off the 380mAh battery - with the screen. Specifically, the Always-on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung developed it quite recently (with the S7 and Note7) and now it has the full 16 million colors at its disposal. Compare that to the 8 (not million, just eight) that the Gear S2 Always on screen could manage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better yet, the Always on screen is updated much more often than before (the second hand ticks!), so you can use it instead of waking the screen (which uses more power).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gear S3 Classic and Frontier are expected to last 3-4 days on average. By using the Power saving feature (which can be enabled manually), you can double that - but this mode restricts features to notifications and calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Off Watch mode kicks in automatically at 5% battery left and only shows the time - no smart features to speak of, but it saves a ton of energy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset definitely helps. Samsung was a bit secretive about the exact specs but did reveal that it's a 14nm chip with two CPU cores at 1.0GHz. Perhaps it's related to the Exynos 7570 chipset somehow, both are the first 14nm entries in their class. The chipset is paired with 768MB of RAM and 4GB of built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S3 runs Tizen 3.2.1 and is fully backward compatible with apps developed for the S2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A big feature Samsung showed off was Pay. The S3 supports both NFC terminals as well as older ones with MST (which the S2 lacked). The interface is simple enough, you scroll through all credit/debit cards you've set up by rotating the bezel. You don't need a phone on you, everything is handled by the Gear S3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S3 has other ways to make you leave your phone at home. There's a 3G/LTE version of the Gear S3 frontier that can make calls on a loudspeaker and microphone (with the S2 generation, this was restricted to carrier-branded watches).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi only versions - S3 frontier and S3 classic - can also work as a hands-free for your phone, so you can leave it in your pocket. You can also control Spotify on your phone, again without taking it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch has its own Spotify app so it can work independently (obviously, you'll need an Internet connection to stream tracks not in offline cache).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Fit2, the Gear S3 features sport tracking features - a heart rate monitor and GPS run tracking to name a couple. Samsung wants to kindle your competitive spirit with a feature that lets you match up against a friend in pursuit of a goal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S3 first thoughts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been two days since we landed in Berlin and we've seen many gadgets, including smartwatches. This is the one that won our hearts with its premium design - it looks like a proper luxury watch. We do prefer the Gear S3 frontier though - for the optional LTE, for the numbers on the bezel, even for the wrist bands. Yes, rubber is usually not the premium option, but in a way we can't convey in text it just feels better than the leather bands used on the S3 classic. Swapping bands is fast and easy, so customization is always an option if you end up liking neither.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may scoff at Tizen, but the reality is that the Gear S3 is miles ahead of its Android Wear competition on a number of fronts. First off, the rotating bezel should be at the center of all watch interfaces. Second, the Always on screen is so much better than what other watches have to offer (yes, even the S2). And with Tizen, Samsung can sprint ahead and add new features without waiting for Google - the Gear S3 has the best wireless payment option of all watches (including the Apple Watch, MST is a big thing in the US). One area where Tizen is behind is iOS integration, but Samsung is working on it, it's already in open beta (but no ETA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung unveiled just one device at IFA, the Gear S3. We suppose, one is enough if it ends up the winner - and we believe the Samsung Gear S3 is a likely one.</paragraph>
