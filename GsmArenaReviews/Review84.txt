			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took cameraphones exactly one year to take the next step in their evolution, closing the gap on dedicated digicams even more. As usual we are here, carefully tracking the progress and checking out if it's going in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 and the Sony Ericsson Satio are easily two of the most interesting phones in our database and their appeal is in no small part due to the 12 megapixel shooters that are mounted on their backs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Satio ? Samsung M8910 Pixon12</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day, Samsung INNOV8 was first to exceed even the most optimistic expectations producing photos of quality unknown to the GSM world before. We are now curious if the Satio and the Pixon12 will take another leap forward, to virtually null the difference in image quality between cameraphones and digicams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the answer to that question will come in the form of one of our trademark full-blown shootouts but until that's finished we decided to give you some food for thought. We've posted several camera samples that we took with the retail units of Samsung M8910 Pixon12 and Sony Ericsson Satio for you to enjoy and compare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now we will refrain from passing any judgment on the image quality, leaving the stage to you instead. Feel free to drop a line in the comment section about which of the two cameras you like better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So take a comfortable seat and prepare to meet the future of cameraphones. A host of 12 megapixel samples awaits after the jump.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The first three pairs of photos are taken outdoors in good lighting, giving the two cameraphones a chance to show their best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes the macro test, demonstrating the close-up capabilities of the duo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there goes a sample from our studio, comparing the flash performance of the 12 megapixel monsters. They are both equipped with xenon, so at least on paper, none of them should be afraid of the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that's it for now. Stay tuned as we hope to deliver more of that stuff, garnished with our traditional in-house analysis. Just to give you a taste of what to expect, check out our last shootout - the Grand 8 megapixel shootout of the latest and greatest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don't forget to share your opinion in the comments section about which images you find generally more pleasing, whether you see any difference in the color rendition and, finally, how you rate the Pixon12 wide-angle lens against the "regular" unit on the Sony Ericsson Satio.</paragraph>
