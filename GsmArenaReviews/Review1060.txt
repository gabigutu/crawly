			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like last year, some of the most interesting new devices to be announced at CES came at the Huawei press conference. This year the company went big - phablet big - with the Ascend D2 and Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two Ascend models both feature big FullHD screens, quad-core processors, Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and massive batteries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the smaller of the two, the Ascend D2, Huawei used a 5" 1080p screen (443ppi), a home-made 1.5GHz quad-core processor and a 3,000mAh battery. There's a 13MP camera on the back, to sweeten the pot, while the smartphone itself is dust and water resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recipe for the Huawei Ascend Mate includes a 6.1" 720p screen instead (it's a 241ppi unit that works with gloves), a 1.5GHz quad-core CPU (the same CPU as the Ascend D quad) and a 4,050mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got some hands-on time with these devices so jump to the next page for our first impressions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend Mate hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has a massive screen even by phablet standards - it's got a 6.1" diagonal. The 720p resolution, however, was a bit of a disappointment. It works out to a decent pixel density of 241ppi, but looks notably worse than the Ascend D2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the sheer size of the screen, Huawei has managed to keep the footprint as small as possible by reducing the size of the bezel (the screen covers 73% of the front). Another thing that helps usability is the customized UI that offers one-hand mode (it's similar to Samsung's solution of squeezing the keyboard and dialer horizontally to make buttons easier to reach).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is highly sensitive thanks to the Magic Touch tech, which allows users to use their Mate with gloves, a feature people in colder climates will surely appreciate. Gorilla Glass protects the screen against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has an 8MP camera which, besides photography, is used in the Guiding Wizard app - an Augmented Reality turn-by-turn navigation with voice guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is powered by a quad-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz and, with a screen this big, it's a great multitasker. To that end, there are floating apps - Notes, Messages, Calculator and video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quite unusual - it's Android 4.1 Jelly Bean underneath, but Huawei has gotten rid of the app drawer, leaving you with just the homescreen, which makes the UI feel similar to iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate packs a massive 4,050mAh battery, quoted at up to 9 days of standby in 3G and 2 days of "ordinary usage". The battery is quick to charge too, though there's no info on how long it takes to charge it full.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all this, the Ascend Mate is no small device - it measures 163.5 mm x 85.7 mm x 9.9 mm and weighs 198g. It's not too heavy (the Lumia 920 and Galaxy Note II are both around 185g, with smaller screens and batteries).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend D2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of the two Huawei devices announced today, the Ascend D2 is undoubtedly the more interesting offering. Its more compact 5" screen packs double the pixels of the Mate and the camera resolution has been upped to 13MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend D2 body is made of aluminum through an elaborate process that Huawei was quite proud of and we have to say the phablet does feel good in the hand. It helps that it weighs 170g and measures 140 x 71 x 9.4 mm - dimensions, which feel quite manageable after handling the Huawei Mate. Additionally, the D2 is built to provide IP54 level of dust and water resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is pretty impressive - 5" big of 1080p resolution and 440ppi, it's ready to take on the likes of the HTC Butterfly and the newly announced Sony Xperia Z and Alcatel One Touch Scribe phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen uses IPS tech for improved viewing angels and Gorilla Glass for scratch resistance. There's no word on Magic Touch though (the tech that allows the Mate to detect touches even when the user is wearing gloves).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Huawei Ascend D2 packs a 13MP camera with a BSI sensor. The camera software offers HDR mode and manual color temperature adjustment. The D2 can shoot 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei claims that the Ascend D2 is great for hands-free talking as its two microphones have no problem picking up sound from 1.5m away and the speaker audio is enhanced by Dolby surround sound. Unfortunately, the Huawei press conference venue is much too noisy to properly test either of these features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the inside, the D2 packs the same proprietary K3V2 chipset with quad-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz and 2GB of RAM. It will run Android 4.1 at launch with a customized launcher, which once again omits the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet has 32GB of built-in storage that isn't expandable, so extreme audiophiles and film buffs may have some trouble fitting all their content. It should be more than enough for the vast majority of users though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is slightly smaller than what the Mate has, but at 3,000mAh it's still bigger than most smartphone batteries out there. The fast charging tech reportedly results in 25% faster charging times than the Samsung Galaxy S III. The wireless connectivity has been tuned to use less power (10% savings for the cell connection and 20% savings for the Wi-Fi).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend W1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei has also launched its first Windows Phone handset at CES this year, the aptly-named Huawei Ascend W1. It features a dual-core 1.2 GHz Krait CPU and Adreno 305 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the Huawei, the device will be competitively priced, coming at a price point somewhere around the Windows Phone 8S from HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of HTC, on first glance the device bears a striking resemblance to several recent HTC handsets. It's perhaps fitting, seeing as how the Taiwanese-based manufacturer is notably absent from this years' trade show, so here we have the next best thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All jokes aside, the W1 features a solid unibody construction, with a special laminate finish on the 4 inch IPS LCD display to reduce screen glare. The WVGA (480 x 800) resolution may seem a bit low, especially when compared to the 1080p 5" of the D2, but it's adequately crisp, and about the same as the 720p resolution stretched on the massive Ascend Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10.5 mm profile is reasonably thick, and Huawei claim that the 1950 mAh battery inside has been optimized for 30% less power consumption, resulting in a 470 hour standby time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back is the 5 MP camera capable of 720p video recording that is especially HTC-looking, and the W1 was showcased all its available colors for us, which include blue, red, black and white.</paragraph>
