			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have just released their B7320 OmniaPRO and now, just a few short weeks later, they are introducing the B7330 OmniaPRO. Some might think there is something wrong. To get straight to the point, there?s nothing wrong with the B7320 OmniaPRO. But who are we to frown at an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, that?s where it gets a bit tricky. First of all, it?s not a major upgrade involving a lot of investment and effort. Plus, the two handsets will perhaps coexist peacefully serving different markets. Still, a few nice little touches make the new B7330 OmniaPRO a real treat. The newcomer is slimmer, has brilliant ergonomics and is quite keen to double its predecessor?s data speeds and boost screen size and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the big news of course is Windows Mobile 6.5. We guess the release of the B7330 OmniaPRO is meant to herald the OS upgrade rather than send the B7320 into oblivion. Actually, the latter ? along with the other current Omnia handsets running the earlier 6.1 version of the OS ? will at some point be upgradeable to WinMo 6.5 anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having cleared that up, we can now get on with our first look at the cute Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO. Cute may sound a bit odd for a business device, but the handset does look and feel great, and is so wonderfully compact that we couldn?t think of any other word to describe it. So, it?s a brand new WinMo powered QWERTY messenger that?s keen to serve and please the eye. Sounds worth a closer look, doesn?t it?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there are some differences compared to the B7320 but they aren't that significant. However, what has been changed has been changed for the better, so now the screen sports some more pixels and real estate, there?s Windows Mobile 6.5 right out of the box, boosted up HSDPA and HSUPA, and a beefier battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the B7330 OmniaPRO has lost some weight and got thinner (the device measures 114.9 x 59 x 10.8 mm and weighs only 107 g) and is now much closer to the famous Nokia E71 or RIM?s BlackBerry devices. Comparing the B7330 to the E71 and the BlackBerry gang is no surprise since all these devices share similar features and perhaps potential users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, enough talking, let's get down to it. Jump on as we explore what the B7330 OmniaPRO is made of, followed by a brief rundown of the interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At only 114.9 x 59 x 10.8 mm, the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO certainly is compact (considering its full QWERTY keyboard, of course). It is visibly wider and slightly taller than a ?normal? bar-shaped phone, but compared to other phones sharing the same market space, the B7330 OmniaPRO?s measurements are just about perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 107 grams won?t add much to your pocket and - by way of comparison - the smartphone weighs a good 20 percent less than the metal-clad E71. However, the Korean doesn?t look any cheaper due to its great build quality and design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the success of devices like Nokia E71 and recent BlackBerry smartphones, it seems the young Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO can hope for a bright future ? though of course it needs to prepare for tough competition. We think it has what it takes to be part of the group of powerful business smartphones and even adds something many of them overlook ? charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its round edges and quality materials make it look much more expensive than it is expected to be. The same goes for the features. And this combination of sleek design and top notch technology sounds like a good formula to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO is pretty standard for the class. The buttons and the display above them are surrounded by glossy grey plastic while the back uses a similar material but colored in black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.62? TFT display on the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO has a resolution of 320 x 320 and really is good. It?s not a touchscreen, nor does it have the resolution of a say, BlackBerry Bold, but there is something very important here, namely improved sunlight legibility. Samsung are known for their less than stellar marks in terms of sunlight performance but the B7330 is among the few exceptions, managing to keep all the information visible no matter how bright the sun is shining. And it gets as close as possible to Nokia screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the display are placed the earpiece (dead center), ambient light sensor (on the left) and secondary video-call camera (on the right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen we find the D-pad surrounded by 6 other keys (3 on each side) ? two soft buttons, Home and Back keys, as well as Call and End buttons. All of them are very comfortable and despite all us guys at the office having larger than average fingers, we had no problems getting used to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the four-row full QWERTY keyboard which is another strong point of the B7330 OmniaPRO. It is quite reminiscent of the one found on the Nokia E71 ? down to the size, shape and even the color of each button. And, in fact, that?s something to be thankful for. What we said about the buttons below the screen goes doubly for the QWERTY keyboard. All keys provide nice tactile feedback and make typing a pleasure on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few of the QWERTY keyboard buttons allow direct access to some of the most useful features of the handset. There are dedicated Lock and Messaging keys, the Space bar can also be used to turn off the ringer, while the Symbol key can access the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the B7330 OmniaPRO hosts the volume rocker and the microUSB port (covered by a plastic protective cap). The latter serves not only as a charger connector but also as a USB data port and headphone jack. Sadly, the B7330 OmniaPRO lacks a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side we find the dedicated Camera key and the microSD card slot (verified to accommodate cards of up to 16GB and claimed to support up to 32GB when those become available) which is sealed with plastic cap to hold off dust and keep the contours of the handset intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the phone are placed the loudspeaker grill and the lanyard eyelet while at the bottom there is only the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, now, B7330, turn around! As mentioned, the back of the smartphone is all plastic but the surface ? though glossy ? looks quite nice. The only problem here (unlike the front) is that the materials used are really fingerprint prone. Luckily, the rear is quite easy to clean. In terms of build quality, we didn?t experience any creaks while handling the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is where we find the 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera. Unfortunately it lacks both a flash and a self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To remove the battery cover you only have to slide it downwards. If you do so, you?ll find a 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery. Its high capacity promises good battery life, however, due to the limited preview time, we?re unable to share any impressions regarding that. Underneath lies the SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on with the user interface of the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO, we have to say once again that despite lacking the metal housing of competitors like the Nokia E71, the Windows Mobile powered smartphone managed to impress us with its commendable build quality and materials. It feels robust and at the same time is compact and light enough to wear even in a shirt pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Assorted homescreens<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO runs on Windows Mobile 6.5 Standard and that's our first encounter with this latest version of the smartphone OS. We're speaking non-touchscreen of course - that's what Standard stands for - but you probably knew that already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is, unlike the touch-enabled WinMo 6.5 Pro, the improvements here are perhaps not as obvious. To tell you the truth, we saw no visual difference at all. Most of the changes we actually noticed were courtesy of Samsung themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not waste any more time and let's get our hands dirty. Samsung have been quite generous in providing a nice set of homescreens to choose from, much like they did with their previous WinMo Standard products ever since the good old Samsung i600 (a.k.a. BlackJack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A variation of the BlackJack card-wheel interface, what we have here is the Samsung WizPro homescreen, which consists of a number of side scrolling panes or tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of them offers different functionality, but the first one is probably the one you should keep an eye on all day. It displays info on time, messages and emails, appointments and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the screens on Samsung WizPro get you access to favorite contacts, the music player (though displaying Album Art is buggy on the homescreen) and even the gallery. There are also a number of shortcuts - to the FM radio, Solitaire, Word Mobile, Task manager and the Wireless manager - again no visual changes in these core WinMo applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the screens, you will also see tight Yahoo integration with Yahoo!Search having its own separate screen - the same thing goes for Yahoo!Finance, which gives you stock quotes of companies that you preset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Giving a nod to current trends, there is a whole screen full of shortcuts to various social networking sites and the Facebook Mobile application even comes preinstalled on the Samsing B7330 OmniaPRO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's weather, of course, courtesy of AccuWeather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also a quick UI demo video, showing the real life performance of the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking its cue from its bigger Pro brother, Windows Mobile 6.5 Standard also comes with its own interesting homescreen. It's called Sliding panes and is scrollable vertically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see it gets the most important info across, such as missed events, messages and appointments plus you've got multimedia panes such as Music player and the Gallery. There's bookmarks too - oops, sorry, that's Favorites in proper MS language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, moving forward, Samsung have also added their location-aware Living World homescreen - those green fields you see down there are the generic background. It's supposed however to change according to the city (or at least country) you're in, showing you some kind of local landmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Samsung also have on board some minimalist homescreens that pay homage to the nice wallpapers that you may have stashed. Those show only the bare minimum amount of info - usually in one row only, but you can of course scroll down. By the way we saw those same homescreens on the Samsung i600 a.k.a. Blackjack when we reviewed it exactly 2 years ago. That's some progress, right?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Going further though is not that great looking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Anyways, we don't want you bored of homescreens, so let's step down to the Main Menu of the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO. We gotta give it to Microsoft developers, they've managed to keep that Windows 3.11 vintage look down the years. It almost makes you misty-eyed with nostalgia, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Samsung-provided homescreen shortcuts, the Task manager is always at hand. Unfortunately, the standard issue WinMo is no good for switching between apps - you can only kill unnecessary processes from here. It's nice to see that those pesky usability improvements have not kept MS engineers up late in the evenings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has a slight facelift<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, Windows Mobile Standard has one phonebook that's certainly not that handsome, but at least it's ready to do whatever you need it to. One visual enhancement over the previous version of the mobile OS is that all contacts now have their images as thumbnails in the list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email is still as good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might guess for a smartphone with a full QWERTY keyboard, the new OmniaPRO is pretty functional, though it does lack a bit of window-dressing. Our test Gmail account was setup in no time just by entering the email address and password.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is not so basic anymore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The WinMo gallery is definitely not as basic as we remember it on WinMo Standard smartphones in the past. Once you select an image in the Contents manager, a nice popup appears to show you a larger version of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some standard features on it, but the one thing we were surprised at is how fast the zooming in and out is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery doesn't have auto rotation of course. Given the perfectly square screen of the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO, an accelerometer makes no sense. Sure, accelerometers are not only about auto-rotation but we doubt it anyone will miss motion gaming, tilt scrolling or tap-for-time given the handset's potential target users. Turn-to-mute we kinda like, but it's no biggie on the B7330 OmniaPRO.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Media player with some fresher looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Media player is the regular WinMo player, only this time Samsung-skinned. It's also used to play video, but there are very few fancy features to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO doesn't have DivX and XviD support, which is quite strange for a recent Samsung smartphone. We tried playing some standard MP4 videos with varying success. You should definitely not exceed 640x360 pixels resolution for them to play smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For YouTube videos there's a separate application preinstalled. But as you'll see, the Internet Explorer Mobile has full Flash support and is just as capable of handling those as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No changes in IE Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only browser on board is the good old Internet Explorer Mobile - if there have been any updates, we couldn't quite see what they were. Well, full Flash support is definitely a plus, as you can easily play YouTube videos; however, the browser lacks any way of centering on screen or even fitting contents automatically. So as you can see below, getting the video screen just right takes some effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile disappointed us with the heavy image compression it applied by default. Since we haven't heard of Microsoft starting server-side compression such as Opera Mobile, we guess the compression is done on the handset itself to save on system resources rather than wireless data traffic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nifty little camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO is equipped with a 3 megapixel auto focus camera. The camera interface is the same as in previous reincarnations of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, a couple of camera samples we took clearly show the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO to have one of the best 3 megapixel shooters on our list:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we are not as impressed by the video recording. It only goes as high as QVGA@30fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, as unimpressed as we are with the whole 6.5 makeover of the Windows Mobile Standard OS, we have to admit that the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO might just be able to get a corner on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A powerful messaging tool on the cheap side, with a complete connectivity set, a decent camera and a pretty good screen is quite an all-round package to justify robust demand. The performance is very much on par with the specs (save for the video playback, which needs some polishing) so the handset looks in a pretty good position to stand its ground against competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we seriously doubt it that a QWERTY WinMo Standard handset will be able to get anywhere near the iconic status of the Nokia E71 for example, but it's not only the champion that gets a medal, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E71</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From what we saw, the B7330 OmniaPRO might just be the right device to keep pressure on competing smart messengers. It may be just us, but Samsung are quite keen to keep the Omnia team up and running. Two more PocketPC's are just around the corner, in the face of the B7610 OmniaPRO and B7300 OmniaLITE. Looks like WinMo and Samsung are not gonna give up the business segment to Eseries and Berries without a fight.</paragraph>
