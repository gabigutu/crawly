			<paragraph>The Motorola Q 9h seems an interesting offer if you're after a smartphone. There's no stylus, nor touchscreen, and neither is likely to be missed. In return you get a full QWERTY keypad, almost complete data equipment and Windows Mobile 6 Standard. If you want a Windows Mobile gadget but are trying to steer clear of touchscreen displays, the Q 9h might just do the job for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Q9h has probably changed its name more times than Cher did facelifts. Interestingly enough, it's still the same handset. The only exception is the Motorola Q9 Global sold exclusively by AT&amp;T in US. It has one tiny difference and that is the integrated GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are not that many Windows Mobile smartphones, and the few around get somewhat overshadowed by the PocketPCs, both in terms of price and functionality. (By the way, this seems the right place for a quick fact: latest smartphones use the Windows Mobile 6.0 Standard, whereas PocketPCs run on Windows Mobile 6.0 Professional. The most obvious difference is the touchscreen functionality, which the Windows Mobile Standard doesn't support. To finish off our trivia update, the Windows Mobile 6.0 Classic is also around, used in devices without phone capabilities.)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of the name of the OS, smartphones are in high enough regard for the enhanced functionality and expandability they offer with extra features and applications. It's also true that not all users would welcome touchscreen, let alone stylus. All that said, the rare combination of a full QWERTY keyboard and Windows Mobile without touchscreen makes the new Motorola an intriguing proposal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A solid piece<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To fully appreciate the size and shape of the Q 9h, we need to consider the underlying concept of the handset. The landscape display and the full QWERTY keypad easily justify the 67-mm width of the device. 118 mm high and 12 mm thick, the Q 9h is quite an agreeably sized gadget. Though not exactly the type to hang on your neck, it definitely won't tear your jacket pocket. The conservatively oblong body is livened up by the curved and sloping edges at the top and bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A shiny black line runs along the sides of the handset. On the right side of the device are the Side Scroll keys with the small knob of the Side Select wedged within them. The whole arrangement works pretty much like the Jog wheel in Sony Ericsson handsets. Another similarity with Sony Ericsson is the back button right beneath the three side keys. Pressing and holding the Side Select key lets you control the master volume, using the Side Scroll keys to set the desired level. Master volume controls the ringer and all other sounds on the device, except the in-call volume level. Alternatively, pressing and holding the Back key is a shortcut to adjusting the ringing volume only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite side of the device we have the universal port for connecting the charger, data cable and headphones. With this Windows Mobile 6 Standard device we have yet another demonstration of a recent trend. The customary miniUSB is yet again replaced by microUSB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside we have dark gray matt surface, most of which is the cover of the Li-Ion battery. A cleft at its bottom marks the loudspeaker. Overall of impressively solid build, the Q 9h only plays up a bit with the slightly loose battery cover. This of course could well be a unit-specific problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the back panel, or the part above the battery cover, holds the manufacturer logo dead center, and the camera lens with flash at the top. At the extreme right edge we have the microSD memory card slot, protected by a plastic cover. One thing at least is unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Top of the front panel, there's another long narrow opening going from side to side, which serves as the earpiece.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Both thumbs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The landscape 320 x 240 pixel screen won't surprise anyone with its resolution and 65,000 colors. The horizontal display is great for both browsing and document reading, readability is adequate even in bright sunlight. The bottom of the display flows seamlessly into the D-pad containing a pair of soft keys, Home key (used to open a quick list of options), Back key, Online key, Messages key and, of course, the usual couple of a green and a red receiver. For better touch orientation the keys are divided by thin rubber ridges. Right in the middle of this bunch of controls is the round four-way navigation button with its confirming centre. All the keys on the D-pad are doing a decent job, tactile orientation is adequate and wrong presses are far more unlikely than with KRZRs and their like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard has 37 keys arranged in four arched rows. Buttons on the alphanumeric keypad are convex and elevated. Almost all of the keys are assigned a primary and a secondary character, the numeric section of the keypad is marked in blue. Backlighting turns automatically on when needed, thanks to the ambient light sensor at the top right corner at the front. Both the QWERTY keyboard and the D-pad are backlit in blue, including the rim of the navigation key. Number keys backlight in a darker shade of blue. The backlighting of the keys' secondary characters is a nice surprise, as we're not used to see that all the time in the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Q 9h is very messaging-friendly; the keypad requires some practice but after that typing is very fast and error-free. The lowest row of keys is quite handy, offering instant access to calendar, contacts, multimedia (Windows Media Player), camera and voice commands. In Q 9h the thing that will require getting used to is the location of the Function Key and the Capitalize Key. Both serve as Shift in a way, but the Function key under the letter A is used for the secondary characters, while the one under Enter will capitalize letters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Little short of perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola took special care of the connectivity capabilities of the Q 9h. Along with GPRS, the device is UMTS and HSDPA enabled. The initial excitement about the supported over-the-air data transfer technologies soon gives way to the disappointment with missing WiFi. However, this is the only communication feature the Q 9h fails to provide, if we don't count the obsolete infrared port. PC communication is ensured with the included USB data cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the usual functionality, Bluetooth on Motorola Q 9h may be used in the so called PC Remote mode. Once you've paired your device with the PC via Bluetooth, the Q 9h screen displays a keypad map showing the keys, which can be used for controlling programs on the computer. The Motorola Q 9h lets you remotely control the desktop, Windows Media Player and PowerPoint on your PC. Bluetooth pairing allows sending email, contacts, tasks, calendar items, audio, ring tones, pictures, video and voice notes to a compatible device. In the Bluetooth utility you choose the type of file and select the objects for sending. Having selected object type, all available files display for you to tick off and send.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile 6 features the Documents To Go office suite, which enables opening and editing Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. PDF viewer and ZIP manager are also available. Files can be sent via Bluetooth, attached to MMS and email, as well as transferred to a computer for editing. Our Motorola Q 9h unit failed opening some of the PDF files. Zip To Go on the other hand, extracts zipped files effortlessly but is incapable of creating new archives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Q 9h pays due respect to the widely-used and appreciated Opera browser. The version, which comes preinstalled in this handset, is Opera 8.6. Virus protection is ensured by McAfee VirusScan, available under Office Tools. This application, somewhat annoyingly, was constantly trying to be in control even with all of its active settings disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of additional applications and software, the Motorola Q 9h pays the price of lacking a touchscreen display. Most of the additional applications don't make a difference if a device has phone capabilities or not. However, the difference between PocketPC and Smartphone is crucial. So users will have to always make sure the extra application they wish to install is compatible with Windows Mobile Standard, instead of Windows Mobile Professional.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Some extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia is duly covered in Motorola Q 9h. Along with the Windows Media Player, a File Manager is also available for the pictures, videos, sounds, games and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking of music and video, we can't afford to overlook the headset included in the retail package. The headphones have a somewhat unusual design, with the two earbuds on equally long cables. Where the cables join, there's a square remote pad with a mic and voice command key. There's no lapel clip. The headset performance fails to go beyond midlevel and, given their connector, you'll just have to live with the audio quality offered. The headset isn't the only accessory supplied in the retail box. The charger and user manual are accompanied by data cable and a 512MB microSD card with an SD adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera at the back sports 2 megapixels. You can choose between four resolutions: 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, 640 x 480 and 320 x 240 pixels. Brightness has seven levels; six presets are available for the white balance. When turned on, the LED flash is lit all the time, so you get a pretty good idea how your shot is gonna come out. This however affects the handset's battery life. The 8x digital zoom has four steps, but its quality will hardly cause any cheers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With adequate lighting pictures are passable, quality plummets in bad light conditions. This Motorola device is meant for work mostly and some users are likely to ignore its shooting capabilities. The camera could've been better by all means with a little effort. With Sony Ericsson P1 for example, which is more of a business device too, pictures looked a whole lot different. The lack of a lens cover seems a minor complaint here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When recording video, you can choose between three resolution levels: 320 x 240, 176 x 144 and 128 x 96 pixels. Most of your recordings will most likely never leave the storage card for direct viewing on the handset's screen, as watching them on PC makes sense for higher resolutions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Almost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, there's almost nothing to complain about with the Motorola Q 9h. Well-readable display, solid construction and a perfect keyboard make a good enough advantage list. OK, a dedicated plug for the headset and miniUSB could've been more welcome. The Windows Mobile Standard has its pros and cons. The preinstalled Opera is a nice touch, provided that most users would've installed it anyway. Documents To Go are a definite advantage over some of the competition with the enabled file editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With UMTS and HSDPA, backed by EDGE, the Q 9h is a strong enough option. The great downside is the absent WiFi. If you can live with that, and want Windows Mobile without a touchscreen, this smartphone is worth considering.</paragraph>
