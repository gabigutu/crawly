			<paragraph>Sharp looks and decent kit, Samsung S7220 Ultra b is one of those handsets that would rather do the job than do the talk. Not so long ago, the S7220 Ultra b could've been basking in the Soul kind of hype. Instead, today it quietly sits in the middle of Samsung's portfolio, ready to cash in without fanfare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 Ultra b knows to keep a low profile - and that's a compliment for a phone with a stunning screen and distinct styling. But it sure knows to keep up with the pace of the evolving midrange and takes a prominent face so you don't get lost in the crowd. In a busy corner of the market, it takes a few aces up the sleeve to keep the competition at a safe distance. The first impressions when we previewed the Samsung S7220 Ultra b back in February were very encouraging but let's see how it stands the test of a full review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most prominent feature of the Samsung S7220 Ultra b is its AMOLED display that sets it apart from the majority of market rivals. The excellent screen quality is topped by a pretty capable 5-megapixel autofocus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice metallic finish and the distinctive styling do give the Samsung S7220 Ultra b a bit of an edge against its competitors. The decent feature set and the solid looks make it a credible contender in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hit the jump to start exploring the Samsung S7220 Ultra b. Bear in mind that while in different parts of the world the handset is known under various names, such as UltraCLASSIC, Lucido and Eltz, we will keep to the original Ultra b.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7220 Ultra b 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 114 x 46.3 x 11.8 mm Samsung S7220 Ultra b is a pretty compact device that can easily be squeezed in most pockets. In addition, the mere 90 grams of weight will hardly be too much of a burden. As usual, our trademark 360-degree spin follows to give a better perspective of the handsets shape and size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have checked our preview, you probably know already that the Samsung S7220 Ultra b did win our appreciation back then. The brushed metal frame around the display is certainly our favorite but the phone is quite a looker overall. Some might argue that the handset won't wow you at first glance and they may perhaps have a point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty though, the phone looks a whole lot better when the top-notch screen is lit up. We got quite fond of the Samsung S7220 Ultra b looks and we need to give it to the designers. It's a neat - even conservative - candybar handset, yet so infused with personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b is equipped with a 2.2" QVGA AMOLED display that takes about half of its front panel. As one might expect, the OLED technology and the sufficient pixel density add up to excellent picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred a slightly larger display - a 2.4-incher wouldn't have hurt. The AMOLED display also has poor sunlight legibility, making it quite a challenge to operate with the phone in the bright sun. It's not i900 Omnia bad but still not quite what we would've liked to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the S7220 Ultra b D-pad and the four main controls around it. The call and end buttons enclose the two softkeys in a quite unusual linear layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might be part of the handset's distinct appeal but it does raise some usability issues. To begin with, the D-pad leaves mixed impressions. Sufficiently raised from its surroundings at the top and bottom, it has a very solid and reassuring Up and Down press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the S7220 Ultra b D-pad still handles a lot better than the context keys. They are too thin and squeezed between the D-pad and the call buttons. As a result, the flimsy press is one of our biggest grudges with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore the soft key location is not well thought of, as the labels on the screen are right over the Call and End keys instead of the relevant buttons. This really makes the first experience with the phone somewhat awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the alphanumeric keypad is the exact opposite. With sufficiently large and terraced keys the numpad is really comfortable to type on and the press feedback is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung S7220 Ultra b hosts the microUSB plug (with a protective cap) and the camera button, which also accommodates the basic Task Manager (application switch). That's the same solution we saw in the Emporio Armani phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All we get on the left is the volume rocker. Typical Samsung, it can be used for scrolling listed submenus up and down. The keys on both sides of the handset are large and comfortable enough, posing little obstacles to usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the handset is pretty plain, featuring only the mouthpiece. It has the same color as the ornamental frame around the screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The back of the Ultra b is where the five megapixel camera lens and the LED flash are accommodated. The lens has no cover, so the frame around it and the fact that it is slightly embedded are the only protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 960 mAh battery. In our field test it managed three days of stand-by that included half an hour of talk time and a few hours of poking around the features and taking some photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also under the rear panel on the right-hand side, but it's easily accessible without having to remove the battery. As we managed to confirm, the Samsung S7220 Ultra b can handle a 16GB microSD card, which is the largest currently available on the market. It also has an acceptable start up time with that kind of cards, unlike the S8300 UltraTOUCH, which was simply intolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of Samsung S7220 Ultra b is commendable and the handset looks reasonably fit to withstand daily wear and tear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface is well familiar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 Ultra b comes with the classical Samsung non-touch user interface, except that this time it is Flash-based. The only noticeable differences however include some nice visual changes like the animated backgrounds in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy custom menu gets activated upon pressing the left soft key from the standby screen. The custom menu allows you to pin any of the items in the interface submenus for an easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display by pressing the confirmation center of the D-pad. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. The four directions of the touchpad have shortcuts of their own and these can be changed according to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 can use the animated traveler background (formerly known as uGo) with analogue clock we came to know since the good old Samsung D900. It sets the standby screen background image according to the country where the phone is being used. The wallpaper is animated: birds are flying in the sky, clouds are moving etc. From 7 pm till 6 am night mood takes over: the sky turns dark, while houses get lit up.There is also another option for the wallpaper - you can select a number of photos that can run in slide show on the desktop. The transition effect can also be changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays a standard 4 x 3 grid of nicely animated icons. Sub-menus on the other hand appear as lists. All in all if you happen to have used a Samsung non-touchscreen handset in the past two years the Ultra b will hardly surprise you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the only major change is the added basic task manager - the so called Application switch, which lets you quickly toggle between calling, texting, browsing and Java Apps. The Java apps section allows you to run several Java titles simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The uncomfortable thing about the Application switch is that it can only be started with the camera key. There's a setting that allows you to use the camera key for only the task switcher, the camera or for both. The last options brings up a popup window every time you press the key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 has some nicely designed themes that go excellently with its design. There were three of them preinstalled and then there's the nice little app that let's you create one of your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialing display is also customizable by font type, size, color and background color - just as with every other similar Samsung recently.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony on a good level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making phone calls with Samsung S7220 was OK with no reception issues experienced for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the Search as Spelling feature which appears in the options menu once you type some digits on the homescreen. It?s actually Smart Dialing as you?ve seen it on other handsets. It will look up for names corresponding to the letters of the typed digits almost eliminating the need to enter the phonebook. we mentioned earlier. The handset checks up both names of the contacts, unlike the U900 which only searched the first names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did our traditional speakerphone test with the Samsung S7220 Ultra b. Here is how it ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured recently. It performs on a good average level, ranking just about the middle of the table. You can find more info on the test itself and the other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: if it ain't broke don't fix it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Samsung S7220 Ultra b hasn't budged an inch, compared to, say, the U900 Soul. Up to 1000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that is now becoming pretty common.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 Ultra b handles its messaging duties seamlessly. The SMS and MMS share an editor. You can covert your SMS to an MMS by simply inserting an image or other multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a counter at the bottom indicating the number of parts longer messages need to split to for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS, 30 push messages, 200 broadcast messages and 30 configuration messages in the phone's memory. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the free memory only. Incoming messages, like calls, can also be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is nice. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 30 minutes to 1 day).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b file browser can list all the folders from both the phone memory and the memory card together or one by one. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, if you misplace some file the handset will still handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside that the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH had isn't present on the Ultra b - the bar handset reads memory cards acceptably fast. And it handles 16GB cards alright.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is passable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ultra b picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. The pictures are seen as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view a picture in portrait or landscape mode with the change between the two modes automatic with the built-in accelerometer. There is also the Samsung proprietary picture scrolling when in landscape by tilting the phone to its side. Mastering the timing and angle of this however is rather hard and can get annoying at time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is irritatingly slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's one of the most capable image editing applications for mobile phones. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b music player is a pretty decent application that hasn't seen much change either. It allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composers. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various sound effects can be activated and there is a choice of three different visualizations, two of which include album art. They all look pretty nice but are hardly anything revolutionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can also be minimized to play in the background. It can than be controlled straight from the homescreen with the D-pad, in which case however the shortcuts applied to its four directions are no longer active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature, available on most recent mobile phones allows the handset to search for alternative frequencies of the same station to achieve better reception. This might be pretty useful when travelling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface without too many features. All the basic are covered though and considering that the screen size doesn't suppose the user to watch whole movies on it that should do the trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MPEG-4 videos but only up to VGA resolution. The D1 sample we tried to play turned out to be unsupported. The video player can also use the accelerometer so once you flip the phone to its side it goes landscape and fullscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An excellent camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7220 Ultra b is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. As it seems, photography was high on the Samsung 7220 R&amp;D team priority list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface very much resembles that of Samsung U900 Soul. It is decently user-friendly but still needs some time spent getting used to it. However, the available settings are quite a lot so we are willing to forgive the somewhat complicated menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more important settings are picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, and frame), effects (black and white, sepia, negative etc.), white balance and face detection. The face detection feature itself works relatively well but is not capable of recognizing several faces so you might have issues focusing on group shots. The smile shutter however which automatically takes photos when a smiling face appears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional camera settings include wide dynamic range, anti-shake, picture quality and ISO settings. Exposure metering is also configurable and the auto focus can be switched off if necessary. Then there's also geo-tagging which allows you to record your current location in the photo's metatags thanks to the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Samsung S7220 Ultra b is excellent, somewhat exceeding our expectations. The image processing is very mature with balanced in-camera sharpening and noise levels and achieves pretty good scene detail without making the photos a noisy mess. Samsung S7220 Ultra b also showed precise exposure metering decent color balance and very good edge-to-edge sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The activation of the wide dynamic range option brings in some detail in the shadow areas at the cost of somewhat increased noise. We are just not sure that the regular user will know when to switch it on plus it's inconveniently buried inside the camera advanced options and gets turned off every time you turn off the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the other most important camera controls such the Macro mode switch, the Flash switch or the Exposure compensation switch are always handy as they are assigned to the four ways of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recoding is concerned, Samsung S7220 Ultra b is pretty much a disappointment. The best it managed to pull out are QVGA videos at 15fps which is quite unimpressive by our books. There might be those rare occasions when the videos will turn up usable but usually they are best used for MMS purposes where filesize is quite limited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is doing fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung S7220 Ultra b you can count on 3G with HSDPA support and GPRS for browsing internet on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, the Ultra b also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. There is also A2DP onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone works seamlessly when transferring data to and from PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default or otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser is fine, but for the flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Web browser of Samsung S7220 Ultra b is pretty decent for the class which usually renders pages pretty well. There are some exceptions in which the Netfront browser struggles but those are hardly frequent enough to bother you. However if you don't stick to the default page size things are slightly different and rendering errors are way more frequent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser offers landscape and fullscreen views and also some nice features like search-in-page, mini map and the virtual mouse pointer. If you browse elaborate pages, the desktop view mode is more appropriate, while for simple sites it's better to use the smart-fit view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pretty big disadvantage of the browser (although probably expected in this class) is the lack of proper Flash support. This means that the fans of Flash video and YouTube will have to go without checking the latest additions on the go - unless you opt for the mobile streaming version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available for setting up: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important and private. The Calendar can store up to 100 appointments, 50 anniversaries, 50 holidays, 20 important and 20 private events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots on Samsung S7220 Ultra b. Each of them can have its own snooze time, number of repetitions and activation days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world clock application, a calculator, and a unit convertor. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably seem appealing to sports-minded users. There is also a handy to-do manager that can help you organize your time better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in the Ultra b is the integrated document viewer. It supports viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files and handles them all pretty well. The application is very fast and generally a pleasure to work with. It has nothing to do with the scrolling and zooming of some other Samsung handsets that take ages on each step.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The GPS speaks only Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the cool features of Samsung S7220 Ultra b is its built-in GPS. It also sports A-GPS for faster initial lock acquisition. Unfortunately the Samsung Mobile Navigator (a rebranded Route66 product) application we saw in some of its relatives isn't anywhere to be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, the users get Google Maps, which unfortunately doesn't offer voice-guided navigation and needs to download the maps in real time over the air. This means that heavy data charges will apply if you aren't on a flat data rate. The cool part is that Street view is finally available, and that certainly is one of our favorite Google Maps features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We went for several 3rd party Java alternatives that are touted to offer voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation but it our experience with Java software is always a hit-and-miss and this was the case with S7220 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the free Java software we tried included Amaze, Skobbler, and WeTravel. Some of them worked well but not 100% of the time. At times we didn't get any satellite lock, we had various installation and setup issues, a lot of hangups and bugs, and most of the applications required downloading the map data live on the go. So your mileage will most certainly vary with Java GPS navigation and you are in for quite some disappointment if you picked the 7220 Ultra b expecting to get a flawlessly working GPS navigation device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So unless Samsung decide to offer the Mobile Navigator as an option to Ultra b owners, you'll most likely do without the navigation stuff anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Trial games only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b offers a huge number of game titles but as usual for the brand starting them brings some heavy disappointment. The fact that only trial versions are included means that you won't be able to enjoy any of them properly unless you spends some extra cash on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The titles include Asphalt 3, Brain challenge 2, Midnight pool 2, Tetris Mania and World Series of Poker Texas Hold'em game.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to the awkward soft keys, the Samsung S7220 Ultra b is actually a pretty nice handset to have. It has a capable camera, a spectacular screen and pretty stylish classical design. The embedded GPS a great asset as its use is limited to getoagging and a handful of location-aware Java applications. We really hope Samsung will supply the Samsung 7220 with a more capable navigation solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7220 Ultra b fares pretty decently in terms of value for money. In its market segment though, it's hardly a winner-takes-all scenario. In the crowded midrange there's always a piece of the action for everybody. With a nicely rounded feature set and solid looks, the Samsung S7220 Ultra b is ready to stand its ground to Nokia 6700 classic, Sony Ericsson C901 and the likes. It even earns bonus points with its amazing OLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6700 classic ? Sony Ericsson C901</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The twist is though that yesterday's high-end is today's midrange. So, along with keeping an eye on the contemporary rivals, the S7220 Ultra b will have to keep quite a few veteran players off its back. A potential bitter rival is the Nokia 6220 classic, which seems to get the upper hand with smartphone capabilities but lacks the OLED screen and the sharp exterior of the Ultra b. Not to mention another time tested performer - the N82, which will even throw in Wi-Fi for probably the best bang-for-buck ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6220 classic ? Nokia N82</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So from where we stand, the Samsung S7220 Ultra b might have just struck the balance between looks and skill, and secured its corner on the market. However Samsung might want to make a better job of promoting it. It sure needs a confidence boost against what looks like quite a bunch of rivals.</paragraph>
