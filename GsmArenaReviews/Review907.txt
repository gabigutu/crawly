			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu's worldwide reputation - or rather lack thereof - isn't necessarily deserved but at home and, in broader terms, emerging Asian markets, its products are synonymous with stellar hardware at a reasonable price. The name should definitely ring a bell to our loyal readers and those who didn't miss the Meizu MX and the MX 4-core will know what to expect. But even if Meizu somehow slipped under your radar, we'll fill in the blanks for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 is closely related to the the original MX and the MX 4-core, by way of both design and equipment. The original Meizu MX launched with a dual-core Exynos chipset and a screen resolution of 640 x 960px - not the kind of specs anyone would call a mistake at the time. Then came the MX 4-core, which became Meizu's ace in the quad-core deck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original MX had the Retina resolution of the iPhone 4 and that was by no means a coincidence. The same goes for Exynos - which has been the chipset of choice for Meizu since. So, three generations into it (or four if you count the MX and the MX 4-core separately), Meizu has a full-HD five incher powered by the chipset that ticks inside half of the Galaxy S4's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flyme OS does things its own way and feels more like the lovechild of Android and iOS. It's clean and minimalist, a flat interface with no app drawer - much like iOS (and compatriots Huawei's Emotion skin for Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything is tailor made - the notification area unrolls just enough to show toggles and events - not all the way down. The main homescreen can be transformed into a vertically-scrollable grid of apps while the two auxiliary homescreens strike closest to home with the generic widget and app/folder arrangement. The single capacitive home button however is another first among droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built around the powerful big.LITTLE Exynos 5 Octa chipset, the Meizu MX3 is has enough speed and power. The screen has solid credentials too: 1080 x 1800 pixels on a 5.1" diagonal. Simply put, it's full-HD in 15:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all its strengths and weaknesses, the Meizu MX3 is a testament to how diverse Android can be. What could spoil a perfectly good, and reasonably priced, package is the very thing that thwarted its predecessors - availability. Meizu hasn't really been able to expand its footprint beyond Asia - but that has very little to do with the quality of the actual devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's now the MX3's turn to try and prove that and we'll do our best to let it demonstrate its full potential, without letting it get away with any sort of weaknesses.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box inside a retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box has always been an eye catcher. Meizus are typically shipped in booklet-style packaging, with the good stuff hiding inside the pages. What's different this year is that the booklet is placed within a bigger box. Size doesn't translate to a greater set of accessories, though - the MX3 comes with a charger only - not even a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger consists of an A/C adapter and a separate USB cable to be used for computer charging or data transfer. The only other thing in the bundle is the peculiar back cover opener. The tool's pointed end is to be pressed against the pin that locks the back cover in place. The panel is raised just enough to insert the flat side of the tool in the tiny crevice and go all the way around until the back panel is fully undone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a finicky task but one that, hopefully, you'll need to perform on very rare occasions. To place the microSIM card in its tray, that is, the phone has no memory card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Meizu MX3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 measures 139 x 71.9 x 9.1mm, which is within millimeters of the LG G2's impressively streamlined body. The MX3 does have a smaller screen but the difference is negligible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight has been kept in check and, at 143g, we'd say the Meizu MX3 is quite comfortable to carry for a 5-incher.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 hasn't changed much - almost any at all. Three generations in a row, this doesn't sound particularly exciting and, honestly, while the Chinese manage to keep up in terms of specs, the Meizu MX3 will struggle to make an impression next to the likes of the Sony Xperia Z and HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe that's never been the point actually - Meizu continue to insist on emulating the iPhone in an Android environment, and the MX3 is arguably the one that gets closest. The good thing is the peculiar 15:9 aspect ratio may as well keep them out of trouble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it's the same entirely black front - regardless of what color you choose for the rear. The back panel is made of plastic to which Meizu has applied some hyperglaze finish - a transparent layer above the coat of paint. Speaking of which, the MX3 comes in a variety of color options for the back cover. Now, that's one more scenario where users will need to go through the particularly difficult routine of removing the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the home key, which started off as a proper hardware button and has since been reduced to a tiny circle of a capacitive key with a LED border that lights up in response to taps - and serves as a breathing light too. Comparisons to the iPhone aside, evoked yet again by the single key on the front, the Home key can have vibration feedback enabled and will lock the screen upon a tap and hold. To unlock, tap and hold and then swipe up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make up for the missing Task Switcher key, the Meizu has another clever swipe-up gesture from the bottom of the screen that will pull up a strip with the icons of the currently running apps. Each of those can be swiped up to dismiss. And it doesn't end there - swipe that multitasking strip to the right and you'll unveil another set of extra five quick shortcuts, along with a brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the impressive edge-to-edge screen with almost no bezel, Meizu managed to first deliver something LG has been getting a lot of praise for lately. The Meizu MX3 is almost identical in size to the LG G2, with a 5.1" screen of 1080 x 1800 resolution against the 5.2" 1080 x 1920 unit on the South Korean flagship. The difference in screen real estate is offset by the fact that the G2 uses on-screen virtual buttons, which Meizu side-stepped by using gestures and different Home key routines. All in all, you can navigate the phone exclusively by touch, if you choose to do so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the MX3 is nicely rounded, but it's a bit too slipper for a perfectly snug fit in hand. The flat front with minimum screen bezel nicely balances that so the handset is reasonably comfortable to operate single-handedly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We love edge to edge screen designs and always appreciate a smartphone that offers the most screen for the available space. The MX3 delivers handsomely there and earns deserved bonus points for the Home key commands and nice gestures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Meizu MX3 features a 2MP front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensor and the tiny earpiece. Under the screen there's the capacitive Home button only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Meizu MX3 features no controls, while the left hosts the single piece volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is placed on the top right side, which is not the most comfortable position - with the Home key handling both lock and unlock this is nothing to fret over. The only other thing at the top is the 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is where the main microphone is next to the microUSB port for charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Meizu MX3, we find the 8 MP camera lens, the noise-reducing microphone and the single LED flash. There's a Meizu logo on the back and finally a small opening at the bottom for the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back button, fiddly as it is, reveals the smallish in appearance 2,400 mAh battery. The battery cannot be removed or replaced.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>15:9 FullHD display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Meizu MX is a 15:9 LCD with the resolution of 1080 x 1800 resulting in crystal clear 412ppi on the 5.1" diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors look great and sharpness is no issue. The viewing angles are also quite good, with the relatively high reflectivity the single noteworthy issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a picture of the display matrix under a microscope - the screen has an RGB matrix with the red, green and blue subpixels aligned in a typical fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu MX3 display matrix under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Meizu MX3 showed good contrast and decent brightness levels throughout. It's nowhere near the top screens in business, like the HTC One or LG G2, but still looks quite pleasant and is sufficiently bright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to our sunlight legibility test, you can see how contrast suffers from the screen being exposed to strong light. The MX3 is very far from the likes of the Apple iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy Note 3, clearly not the best screen to work with in the sun.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery in the Meizu MX3 is a 2,400mAh Li-Po unit quoted at around 430 hours of stand-by in 2G and 393 hours in 3G. Official talk time figures specs are 12 and 14 hours respectively, with 40 hours of continuous music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our own tests revealed that the MX3's battery can't quite handle the ample screen and capable chipsets the way some of its high-end rivals do. The talk time endurance was good, and so were the web browsing times, but video playback disappoints. There's also very high stand-by power draw, which results in an overall unimpressive score of 36h.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 premieres the custom-built Flyme OS 3.0, which sits atop Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. Flyme customizations run really deep and Android looks quite different from what you'd expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a video demo of Flyme OS running on the Meizu MX3 - here it goes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though it's based on Jelly Bean, the Flyme OS is very simple Android with a flat interface and no app drawer. You can put folders and widgets on the homescreen but shortcuts are an alien concept to the UI - essentially, each app you install appears on the homescreen. This is the ultimate simplicity - there's no app drawer to drag icons from onto the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home button has been assigned extra duties which make the lock button feel redundant. A swipe up from the home button and onto the inactive screen will unlock the Meizu MX3, while a press and hold on the home button will lock the device back down. So in essence you'd need the power button only for turning the device on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Meizu MX3 is a pretty simple affair. You drag upwards to unlock and have the option of passcode-locking it, which also adds a camera shortcut to the mix. Gone are the two shortcuts for phone and messaging of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pattern lock faithful will be disappointed as there's no such option with the MX3 lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three homescreen panes as a start - the one in the center is the one you're taken to when you hit Home. The homescreen is where all of your apps reside in a vertically scrollable grid, with three docked apps for browser, phone and messaging. You can place up to five icons there if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no button to speak of, the Task Switcher is launched with another clever gesture - a swipe up from the bottom of the screen. A thin black strip of icons of the running apps appears, where each can be swiped up to dismiss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the app switcher strip sideways reveals a brightness slider and an extra five shortcuts to favorite apps which can, and should, be different from the five you have docked on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets can be placed on the homescreen and while doing so you can add extra panes to place them on. The homescreen panes are not numbered but have letter labels instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To place widgets you need to press and hold on a blank spot and hit the + widget button that appears at the bottom of the screen. The choice of available widgets is quite limited out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area doesn't unroll all the way down but instead takes only a portion of the screen depending on the amount of notifications you have. There are five preset toggles for Wi-Fi, mobile data, Bluetooth, GPS and screen rotation. You cannot add new ones but you can reorder them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also manage the available Wi-Fi connections from the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu on the Meizu MX3 is laid out in a tabbed interface, with the main categories on the left and the related options on the right. In the default view, the settings categories are just icons but a swipe will reveal their full names if you can't find what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a different theme for the Meizu MX3. By default there's only one but you can browse the App Center for more - some of them are paid but there are many free and a lot to choose from. There's also a variety of built in wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flyme OS 3.0 is an unusual mix between Android and iOS but offers a nice middle road, and once you get to know it, could be a pleasure to work with. Everything is smooth and the custom gestures work quite well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike most Android devices these days, the Meizu MX3 doesn't have a reserved shortcut to launch Google Now. Instead you need to turn to the widget or app shortcut on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information about upcoming games you wouldn't want to miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget which generates information for you based on what your interests are.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 shares a chipset with the I9500 Galaxy S4 - an ARM big.LITTLE quad-core Cortex-A15 and quad-core Cortex-A7 combo on a Exynos 5410 Octa SoC. The four 1.6 GHz Cortex-A5 cores do the heavy lifting, while the auxiliary 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7s ensure the power-efficient performance for less-demanding tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 2 GB of RAM and graphics are handled by the PowerVR SGX 544MP3 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the Snapdragon 800 and Apple's 64-bit A7 chip are the standard-setters, with the Exynos 5 Octa trailing slightly behind, but let's see how the Meizu MX3 fares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi shows it to be a below average performer, outclassed by the likes of the HTC one, the Snapdragon Galaxy-600-powered S4 and even the Octa-rocking Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack also places the Meizu MX3 in the unenviable company of year-old ex-flagships - the likes of the HTC's One X, Galaxy S III and Nexus 4.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now, the GPU-intensive GLBenchmark 2.5 and 2.7 focus on the off-screen prowess of the PowerVR graphics chip inside the Meizu MX3. GLBenchmark 2.5 saw the Meizu outclass some of its direct rivals - the Snaprdagon-powered Galaxy S4 and both HTC Ones, but 2.7 saw it slide lower down the ranks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the web is an essential skill of a modern day smartphone, so we tested the JavaScript performance in SunSpider, HMTL 5 performance in BrowserMark 2 and both mashed together in Vellamo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider saw the Meizu MX3 about on par with the S600-powered Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of synthetic benchmarks the Snapdragon 800 and the software optimizations of the competition are well out of reach, but the Meizu MX3 is a more than decent performer in real life. It didn't slow down once during our testing - apps are launched instantly, webpages loaded reasonably fast and animations are buttery smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800-powered devices have the MX3 on the run but you can go about your business not noticing this.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Minimalist phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At its core, the phonebook on the Meizu MX3 is a list of all contacts but you can view only a specific group or filter where contracts come from - phone contacts, email account or a Meizu account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't add Facebook or Twitter or any social network out of the box. Installing the Facebook or Twitter app will allow you to sync your contacts from there. You can link contacts, but the functionality is annoyingly limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook will automatically link contacts with the same name, but that's it. You can't manually link or unlink contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact's info shows you all the available details and that's about it. We liked how phone numbers are listed though - the whole line is a button that will dial the number, but there's a message icon to the right to send a text message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook integrates with the phone app and the call log. The only new addition to the phonebook is the search field at the top of the contact list in addition to the alphabetical scroll.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no reception issues with the Meizu MX3 - in call sound quality was top notch and loud enough. The call log is the first tab of the telephony app and it keeps a list of all your recent calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer lacks smart dialing but there's a handy search shortcut below it. While you're in a call you get controls to access the numpad, mute the audio and you can even take a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calls will display in the notification area if you leave the dialer app. During a call, the proximity sensor will lock the screen when you lift the phone up to your face. There's an option for the phone to vibrate when the call is connected, so you won't miss it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To set a custom track as a ringtone you need to copy it to the designated Ringtones folder, which will make it accessible in the Settings menu. You can't just use the music player like on most Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed our loudspeaker test on the Meizu MX3 and it got a good result, meaning you're not likely to miss any calls with it. Here the full breakdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on how we test loudspeaker performance here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is top notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just New message, Search and Settings buttons. Above is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, the input field starts out at only one line tall, but will grow to up to seven lines if need be. Left of the text box is a button that handles attachments and smileys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a smile, a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Batch operations are enabled for multiple threads - Mark as spam and Delete are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard looks pretty much like the Google keyboard. You can also enable handwriting but in our case we only got support for Chinese. Interestingly the keyboard will not turn to landscape in the messaging app, like it would in the browser for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging deeper into Settings you'll come across the so-called Flyme Messages. If you turn this on and log in with your Flyme OS account, you'll be able to send free messages (text or multimedia) to other Flyme-enabled devices - just like the iOS iMessages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, we were surprised to find the default Gmail app is missing. You could always download it from the Play Store though (if you live outside China, where the Play Store is not available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu have tweaked the generic email client instead and decided it would be enough for all your email accounts. It supports multiple Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. Just swipe out the side-placed menu and you get all your folders plus your accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's support for batch operations - Mark, Filter and Delete are the available options. Filter acts against spam to weed out unwanted email addresses. There's also the option to switch to threaded view in which case an icon appears alongside the name of each thread, giving you the number of messages inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an email is a pleasure on the spacious and wide screen of the MX3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu hasn't made many changes to the Flyme gallery. It stacks images from folders just like the regular app, but this is about where similarities end. Inside the folders, images are arranged in a rectangular grid. You can email, share (via Bluetooth, MMS) or delete multiple images by picking them one by one from the grid after you tap and hold on a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single image, a tap on the screen will display the available options. You can Share, Crop, Delete, Set Wallpaper, Rotate, Open in Image Editor and view Details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 came with a very good file browser preinstalled. It lets you browse the contents of the built-in memory and offers features such as copy, paste and delete for multiple files. Sharing files over Bluetooth or email is also easy as are batch operations with multiple files and folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also handled opening and extracting ZIP files, which can come in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with lyrics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player can only find tracks located in a specific folder. You can browse your collection the traditional way or you can select to have it filtered by folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first case tracks are sorted into several playlists like All songs, Recently added, Folders and you have the option to create custom playlists. When viewing All songs you can choose between three types of sorting in a tabbed layout: song name, artist and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music controls are at the bottom of the screen. Choosing an artist will show you all the albums and corresponding songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle section with the full-size album art is side-scrollable: you can swipe to the left or right to display the current playlist or the lyrics karaoke style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the equalizer from the advanced menu. It features several presets, which you can edit manually - but you need to insert the headphones first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the music player is working you'll get music controls on the lockscreen - there're always available in the task switcher too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a play timer, which will turn it off automatically in 5 - 60 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 comes with a dedicated Video app, but it expects videos to be placed in a certain folder. You can use the file browser to get videos to play from elsewhere - it offers thumbnails and everything so we ended up using it more often than the Video app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the player, things really start to look up. The player handled all the DivX, XviD and H.264 files we threw at it trouble-free (in .AVI, .MKV and .MP4 containers) and resolution didn't matter either - 1080p videos played without a hitch. The audio codecs weren't a problem either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enjoying videos on the big 5.1" FullHD display is a pleasure. The now playing interface offers a scrubber and play controls - pause, forward and rewind. You can choose to watch the same video continuously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching a video you can select to see a thumbnail grid of all your videos and switch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 brough a hell of a nice surprise when we subjected it to our audio quality test. The smartphone delivered some of the finest output we have seen, and with no EU-mandated volume limitations to worry about, also garnished it with volume levels far above anything else in the market (yes, including the HTC One lineup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The no-headphones test brought excellent scores all over the field and no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second trial went almost as well, with the above average increase in stereo crosstalk the only thing not imrpessive about the MX3 performance. This is certainly a smartphones the audiophoiles should watch out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things, the Meizu MX3 has an 8 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels and an LED flash. The camera has a 1.4 µm pixel size and the aperture is a wide f/2. The single LED flash can be used to shoot video in poorly lid conditions or facilitate low-light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with many of its competitors, Meizu has went with a unified camera and camcorder interface, featuring a big virtual shutter button for stills and a smaller camcorder shutter above it for video. This makes framing a video very tricky because you get the 4:3 aspect viewfinder, which then turns into a zoomed in 16:9 video one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the Flyme camera app is located on the right side. You get a shortcut to switch shooting modes - Auto, Panorama, Macro, Text and Beauty. The other settings you get are ISO, White Balance, Capture Setting and Record Setting. There's no Wide Dynamic Range this time, which was Meizu's proprietary HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the volume rocker to capture images with the camera. Unfortunately, it is of no use for auto-focus, with which we had issues. Sometimes the MX3 was hesitant to focus and the viewfinder stayed blurry until we touch-focused it. You can tap and hold the virtual shutter though and the phone will autofocus before taking the shot upon releasing the virtual button and continuous autofocus is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool feature of the MX3 is called Gesture capture and it allows you to snap a photo by putting your hand the top part of the phone. It works with the built-in proximity sensor and lets you snap a photo without touching the screen and introducing unnecessary camera shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the Meizu MX3 have very pleasing amount of details for the 8MP league and nice contrast. Colors turn out pleasing and the white balance was spot on. The noise levels are way too high, though, which is our main issue with the camera and somewhat damages the whole experience. The other thing is the over-enthusiastic metering, which results in the occasional over-exposed shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MX3 has a dedicated Macro mode and decided to test it out. The results we got are very impressive. The smartphone lets you get really close to the subject and capture really fine detail. The short minimum focus distance, along witht he bright aperture also enable you to produce nicely blurred backgrounds - something mobile phones are always struggling with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 also offers Panorama mode, but we are far from impressed by its performance. The panoramas on the Meizu MX3 came out really fast but the detail level is really low when compared to the still images and the resolution is hardly spectacular at 10MP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've enrolled the Meizu MX3 into our photo quality comparison tool where it will do battle with the likes of the LG G2 and Galaxy S4. You can choose any other smartphone adversary you like so go nuts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a world filled with smartphones capable of 60 fps shooting at 720p and 1080p and 120 fps shooters at 720p, and even 2160p 4K video capturing, the Meizu MX3 goes for a rather pedestrian 1080p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 records FullHD videos at 1920 x 1080 resolution with a framerate of 35 fps. That's not all, the bitrate of the videos is a whopping 100 Mbps, which to put in perspective is twice the bitrate of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3's 2160p video and around 4 times the 1080p bitrate of said phablet. That's whopping and from a technical standpoint it's very impressive that the MX3 can actually record at this insane bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in real life this means that 11s of video is around 100 MB, which can be really problematic when you don't have expandable storage. And while the lack of compression saves you some artifacts in your videos, we are certain a better balance could be struck between those. If the bit-rate was reduced three times, you would probably be hard-pressed to tell the difference and you'd be saving a lot of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos themselves have very good detail and run extremely smoothly thanks to the higher framerate. Focus is not overly active and generally accurate and we'd easily say this is one of the best 1080p camcorders on the market today. However, it still stands no chance against the 4K recording of the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an untouched 1080p@35fps (0:11s, 100MB) video taken straight off the Meizu MX3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 will work worldwide thanks to its penta-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support. HSPA is only dual-band though and there's no LTE support on the device but given its limited global availability doesn't seem like such a waste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locally, you get dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n. The Meizu MX uses Bluetooth 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port supports mass storage connections with a computer as you would expect and has USB on the go. The Meizu MX3 also supports Wireless Display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also NFC support on the 32, 64 and 128 GB models (only 16 GB model lacks it) to complete the tally.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Home-brewed browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser plays a central role in the Meizu MX3 as evidenced by its shortcut's position - the middle shortcut in the dock at the bottom of the homescreen, which is usually where the app drawer shortcut goes (or the dialer shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface dedicates almost the entire screen to the web page, save for the status bar on top and a tiny bar on the bottom for refresh, tabs and bookmarks. Choosing tabs opens a quick pop up preview of your open tabs instead of bringing up an entirely new screen, which is great as it still leaves the website your on in plain view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming. It's really fast and fluid too. There are also goodies like text reflow or sharing an URL over email or SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Adobe Flash support out of the box but, oddly, the browser didn't allow flash games to be played. Videos were okay, though. Naturally the Meizu MX3 also supports HTML5 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no Google Chrome on board but you can load it up from the Google Play store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 features a calendar that supports multiple online accounts. It offers monthly, weekly, daily and agenda views and is pretty straightforward to work with. Creating a new event lets you set which calendar to store it in, along with a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has a very minimal, clean look but retains all the functionality you'd expect. You can also go for the Google Calendar - it's available as a separate app from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator app is also on board. Interestingly you can use it as an overlay to the homescreen. You can't manually resize it but you can choose between two size settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we have the Clock app that will handle multiple alarms with custom repeat times, ringtones, snooze time and labels. There are also a stopwatch and timer integrated within the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app offers four different colors for the background of a note, which will be helpful if you want to organize them into several categories. There's a widget accompanying the Notes app, which displays the most recent notes and offers a quick shortcut for creating new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recorder app rounds off the organizer functionality of the phone. It offers the option to record calls, which some might find useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already discussed the Documents app, which is the built-in file manager. It handles all sorts of files, gives you copy, cut and paste and you can also mass select and drag items between folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Painter is an interesting app, which lets you doodle with your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd recommend getting a stylus for the MX3 if you're into digital drawing as the app gives you a very powerful feature set. You can choose between different input options (pens and brushes), choose the opacity, thickness of the line, color, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also let's you choose between four painting modes - Doodle, Watercolor, Blackboard and Sketch - each giving you different options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main organizing apps are covered with the Meizu MX3 but if you find yourself needing something new the Google Play store is the place to turn to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play and Meizu App store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the Google Play store it's present on the Meizu MX3 in its Jelly Bean glory. It features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, audio and video players, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Meizu-built App Center. It has custom-made apps for Meizu devices but all of them are in Chinese, making them unusable for the non-Chinese user. Still many of the apps are free (paid ones are in Yuan) and there's a big line of categories to choose from, including Staff picks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX3 has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in about 20-30 seconds (with A-GPS switched off no less). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is an integral part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu has delivered a solid smartphone and an interesting alternative to the mainstream Android flagships. The MX3 is more than capable of meeting even advanced users' needs, while the way of interacting with the device is simple and in large parts very innovative. This is Android like you've rarely seen it before and, if you don't mind experimenting, the Meizu MX3 is one of few phones that dare do things differently without making a mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos 5 Octa isn't the benchmarking champion we all thought it would be but it's by no means a letdown and has no trouble keeping up with the Jelly Bean / Flyme combo. The compact size that enables comfortable one-handed usage rounds off an overall quite credible package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A certain level of prejudice cannot be helped against the Made in China tag but we can safely say the Meizu MX3 doesn't warrant this kind of attitude. Other Chinese makers too are keen to prove a point to the Android establishment, with the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi having the most likely rivals of the Meizu MX3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi MI-3 runs a heavily-customized Android Jelly Bean, sporting a 1080p five-incher and a 13MP snapper, all powered by either the potent Snapdragon 800 or the Tegra 4. There's a bigger battery in that polycarb body that takes heavily after the Lumias, much like the Meizu MX3 and its fixation on the iPhone and there's still no word on the availability of the Snapdragon 800-powered one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Xiaomi MI-3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend D2 is another strong challenger with a 5" FullHD IPS display, 13MP stills, more robust battery and 32 gigs of inbuilt storage. There's a home-brewed Huawei K3V2 chip with four 1.5 GHz cores doing the math. The Ascend D2 has been available for a while and costs a little less than the Meizu MX3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei Ascend D2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 was also released nearly a year ago and had us duly impressed with an outstanding 5" display, capable quad-core processor and a 13MP still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, what goes on its home turf is of primary concern but if the MX3 is to ever hope for a global breakthrough, Meizu certainly has a wary eye on the established players too. They are still more expensive but also readily available, which makes them so hard to compete against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has just about the same dimensions as the Meizu MX3 but with a better chipset and an optically-stabilized 13MP camera. One of the Galaxy S4 versions shares the same Exynos chipset, and even though the processing power may vary, every Galaxy S4 package will offer a great 13MP still camera and a laundry list of advanced features. The likes of the Sony Xperia Z and the HTC One are no less powerful and feature-rich phones, and they have the kind of premium looks too that the Meizu MX3 cannot really match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     LG G2 ? Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 ? Sony Xperia Z ? HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it sure looks like the Meizu MX3 is punching above its weight but it's not the courage of desperation that's driving it. No, it looks certain that we're going to see more of the Chinese maker. Right now, there are a lot of things to consider before going for a phone like the Meizu MX3: costs for shipping cross-continent, limited international warranty, software upgrades and customer support. The retail price too - the phone costs a $100 less in China than it does in Europe - if you're lucky enough to find a retailer in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone package in itself though is surprisingly solid - and this has nothing to do with luck.</paragraph>
