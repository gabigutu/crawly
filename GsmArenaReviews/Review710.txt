			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG didn't bring the awaited LG G4 flagship to CES, probably keeping it under wraps until the MWC in March. Instead, today we got the premium LG G Flex2 top dog, one of the most powerful smartphones around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new curved phablet introduces better display and packs the Snapdragon 810 beasty chip - it has an octa-core processor, an Adreno 430 GPU and 2 or 3 gigs of RAM depending on the configuration. The curved design isn't the only interesting innovation, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new LG G Flex2 comes with an even better protection both for the display and the rear cover. Enhanced front protective glass and self-healing coating over the back sound rather cool, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The comfy control deck over the back, just below the new 13MP OIS+ camera is something we really like in the LG lineup and we are glad the company has stuck to this features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Go your interest? Follow us after the jump for the real fun!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G Flex2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex was one of those niche devices that may not sell well, but still make enough of an impact to leave an honorable footprint in history. The G Flex received mostly positive reviews both from the press and the early adopters. It may not be the best seller the G2 and G3 flagships were, but it was still a milestone LG definitely needed in its portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original G Flex was designed and built around a seemingly simple recipe, including a curved body, a curved P-OLED display, and a self-healing coating over the back. Of course, as a premium top-tier device, LG G Flex has to pack the latest available tech by the time of release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, LG introduces the next generation curved smartphone - the LG G Flex2. It follows the basics established by its predecessor, building upon its major principles and developing further the features that made the G Flex so attractive and popular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the new LG G Flex2 is now official and the launch is almost here, too. The new Flex2 features a smaller 5.5" P-OLED curved display, but with higher 1080p display resolution. This means you'll be getting a nice and lively P-OLED display of 403pp density, which is more than enough. And the curved screen indeed looks gorgeous, especially when you are enjoying high-res multimedia content in landscape orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex2 is currently the most powerful smartphone to date. Sure, the Snapdragon 810 chipset ticking inside will make it to a plethora of devices later, but few of them will offer displays of 1080p resolution. The lower display resolution will give it a noticeable edge over the competition and the G Flex and it octa-core processor plus the latest Adreno 430 will be benchmark toppers for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beautiful LG G Flex2's display is protected by a piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, but LG has enhanced it further making it 20% tougher than the usual. LG says Corning had no part in creating the improvements in the proprietary dura-guard glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of toughness, LG F Flex2 might be quite durable on the front, but it also comes with an impressively protected rear cover. It follows the steps of its predecessor, introducing an even better self-healing coating that "heals" up to 18 times faster. LG claims everyday scratches and dents disappear for about 10 seconds at room temperature. This is indeed quite an achievement but we are yet to test how this turns out in real-life usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is removable, but the 3,000 mAh battery is not user accessible. You can just hot-swap the microSIM and the microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex2 will launch this month in Korea in Platinum Silver and Flamenco Red colors. Both look great and thanks to the rear protective coating covering the glossy material, fingerprints and smudges are highly unlikely to stick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet the rear control deck LG is so proud of is here to stay. The keys and placement are very similar to LG G3's, and there is no hump at the back as it was the case with the original G Flex. The volume rocker has a nice dotted pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the rear controls is the 13MP camera sensor, the same as on the LG G3. It features OIS+ optical stabilization, and it works side-by-side with the laser autofocus LG has been offering on its G3 top phones for a while. A dual-LED two-tone flash is also around, helping you achieve better low-light shots. LG says the camera shoots better quality images compared to LG G3's but we are yet to put this to the test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG G Flex2 packs an IR blaster, which somewhat became a mandatory feature for flagships in the recent years. It will allow you to control remotely various devices across your home, the TV being the most targeted one, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the G Flex2 has the microUSB port, which has been upgraded with fast charging capability. LG is providing a compact 2.6A wall charger, which will charge the G Flex2 a lot faster than usual - up to 50% in less than 40 min. This isn't as impressive as Oppo's Rapid Charging, but is still faster than most of the smartphones out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G Flex2 hands-on (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex2 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 810 chip. It offers an octa-core 64-bit processor with four Cortex-A57 @ 2.0GHz and four Cortex-A53 @ 1.5GHz cores. It also comes with the most powerful Adreno GPU to date - the Adreno 430 as well as 2GB or 3GB of RAM depending on the storage flavor you choose - the 16GB or the 32GB model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were able to test the CPU performance via the latest GeekBench 3 and it turned out great - the best score produces by a smartphone to date. It seems those eight cores will be providing stellar performance. Note that this unit is running on a pre-release software version, so the performance could be even better on the retail unit.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex2 runs on Android 5.0.1 Lollipop skinned with the latest LG launcher. In addition to the native 64-bit OS support coming from Lollipop, the highlights of the proprietary launcher include Gesture Shot, Gesture View and Glance View features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gesture Shot allows you to capture selfies easily, recognizing your hand from 1.5m. Gesture View helps you view the last shot, while Glance View displays key info on the display when it is off (Samsung offers the same within the TouchWiz UX).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a short hands-on video showing the G Flex2 in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex2 kicks off later in January in its homeland - South Korea, while the rest of the world will get it in the following couple of months. It will carry a premium price tag over the LG G3 flagship, just like the Galaxy Note Edge does over the Galaxy Note 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Aka hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do you want your phone to have a personality? With LG Aka your phone will be able to look at you. Literally. And the looks can be different depending on what you have done...Received, we meant received. Either it's a new message, a missed call, new social notifications, or similar, LG Aka will give you a unique look and you'll know what's going on immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Aka is s decent mid-range phone with a 5" IPS screen of 720p resolution, and runs on a quad-core 1.2GHz processor with 1.5GB of RAM. There are also an 8MP rear cam, 16GB expandable storage, LTE connectivity and a 2,610 mAh. The Android OS in charge is KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four Akas - Eggy is yellow and easily falls in love, Wooky is white and is a bit of a bully, YoYo is pink and has difficulties sticking to its diet (so its weight yo-yo's) and Soul comes in Black and is a music lover. There's a backstory about the Akas, which involves an alien invasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Akas look really great and very similar to most of the G-series - the volume rocker and the power button are on the back, while the 8MP rear cam features a laser-assisted autofocus option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Aka's eyes serve as notifications. They get dizzy when you shake the phone, they look down when you need to take the phone out of the case (i.e. there's a notification) and so on. Eye color changes from red to green to indicate different emotions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG is selling all the proprietary cases separately, so if you get tired of your Aka's original personality, you can easily switch it just by getting it a new case. There's a point system associated with buying new accessories for your Aka, an interesting (if a bit questionable) monetization strategy from LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cases are glossy, while the rear of the Aka is made of matte textured plastic as are the rear keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Aka, whatever the personality, seems like a very clever and original idea, which will be appreciated among lots of different type of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the LG Aka is available exclusively in South Korea for $450, but now that we find it at CES, there is a chance we see it escape its homeland very soon.</paragraph>
