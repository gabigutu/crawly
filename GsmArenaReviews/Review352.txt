			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Each year Alcatel designs a plethora of affordable devices and most of them become available as carrier-exclusives around the world. The Pixi series has been quite popular among the budged devices, as those phones have been fully subsidized by the operators. And while you may not be seeing Alcatel in most of the retail stores, its phones are out there offering Android experience on affordable prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year Alcatel decided to offer the users even more choices and in addition to the new Pixi 4 lineup, Alcatel expanded its device portfolio with new Windows 10 phones and slates. You bet they come with attractive price tags and target the mainstream users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, at CES 2016 Alcatel brought four Pixi 4 Android devices of different sizes - 3.5", 4", 6", and 7". We also got the Pixi 3 8" Windows slate, a kid's smartwatch. Alcatel also showcased the Fierce XL Windows 10 smartphone, exclusive to T-Mobile, as well as the water-proof Go Play smartphone also known as Conquest for Boost Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without further ado, we go live with our hands-on impressions from Alcatel's booth tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Pixi 3 (8) hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The newly announced Alcatel Pixi 3 (8) sure sounds good on paper despite of its little bit archaic specs. It's an 8" Windows 10 Mobile slate and the OS has proven lightweight already - its previews have been available and running OK on phones having as low as 512MB RAM, so we are definitely not worried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixi 3 (8) packs an IPS screen of 1280 x 800 px resolution, and runs on the Snapdragon 210 chip. The SoC offers a quad-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 304 GPU, and 1GB of RAM. Indeed, those are quite dated, but more than enough to run smoothly the Windows 10 Mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet offers 32GB expandable storage, a 5MP main camera, and a 4,060 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixi 3 (8) is made of matte plastic and you can have it in black or white. The design is comfy and handling is very good. Overall for an entry-level slate, the Pixi 3 (8) does very well and with the right pricing it may become an excellent offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Fierce XL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Fierce XL smartphone was announced in the penultimate day of 2015 year and is headed to T-Mobile US. It may become available to other carriers as well, but there is no additional information right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Fierce XL is a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone with a 5.5" HD display and runs on the Snapdragon 210 chip, which seems to be a personal favorite for Alcatel. Unlike the Pixi 3 slate, though, the Fierce XL comes with 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the specs include 16GB expandable storage, an 8MP main camera, and a 2,500 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Fierce XL smartphone is made of matte plastic as well and provides for a pleasant handling and good grip. The phone isn't that compact, but the 5.5" size is becoming rather common these days, so no complaints here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Windows 10 Mobile OS ran smoothly and hiccup-free, so it should serve well to anyone who opt for this Alcatel. Once again if price right, say $0 with a contract, the Fierce XL may account for quite a few shipped units.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Android devices Alcatel did bring to CES 2016 were already unveiled at the last IFA expo in Berlin - the OneTouch Xess tablet, the water-proof Go Play smartphone, and the water-proof Go Watch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OneTouch Xess<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xess slate (pronounced 'excess') is a massive 17.3" tablet with 10,000 mAh battery and a big kickstand over the back. The stainless steel construction is quite impressive, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xess has a 1080p screen resolution and runs on MT8783 chip with an octa-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 CPU, Mali-T720MP3 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. There are also 32GB expandable storage, a 5MP camera and 3W dual JBL speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This thing has been designed to be used in the kitchen and you can control it without touching it. The design is great indeed and the slate looks impressive, but we still don't know when it will hit the retail shelves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OneTouch Go Play and OneTouch Conquest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The OneTouch Go Play and OneTouch Conquest are one and the same Android smartphone - the Go Play is the international model, while the Conquest is headed to Boost Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Go Play isn't new, but is still rather attractive and worth double checking. The phone is IP67 rated for water and dust resistance, comes with a 5" HD display, Snapdragon 410 chip with a quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, an 8MP camera, and a 2,500 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel promises the Go Play to be shock-resistant as well, so it should be a more durable toy, than say an Xperia Z3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you like tough smartwatches, than its Go Watch companion may interest you as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Go Play and Go Watch feature GoPro integration and can double as remote shutters and viewfinders, which is very nice.</paragraph>
