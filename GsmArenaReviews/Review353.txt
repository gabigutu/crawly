			<paragraph>       Samsung F300 Ultra Music  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The famous South Korean manufacturer has stopped being afraid of making experiments. Once it used to only make silver clamshells almost impossible to differentiate one from another. Today, however, the situation has changed significantly. Samsung already has a fancy portfolio including several new, very untraditional models. One such phone is Samsung Ultra Music F300 of the Ultra Special line up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Both-side premiere<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F300 is the first phone with dual face construction on the market. It does not have a standard back side in the form of a battery cover. Each of the phone sides features a display and a certain number of keys. One of the sides operates calls and standard phone activities. Here you will find a tiny display and a classical numerical keypad. From now on we are going to call this side "the phone side". The opposite side features a notably bigger display, beneath which you will see a touch sensitive navigation key with a confirming center, just like in some MP3 players. Let's call this opposite side "the multimedia side".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Samsung designers know that slimness is in the vogue today  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels pleasantly small thanks to its minimum thickness (9.4 mm) and size (103.5 x 44 mm). Without the case the phone weighs mere 79 grams, while including the case its weight increases by additional 77 grams. Samsung F300 has a very good construction. It is made of high-quality materials, which slightly remind rubber, when touched. No creaky sounds are heard at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;       Several control elements on the sides of the phone: two slots and two connectors  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both sides of the phone are covered with plenty of control elements and protecting covers. On the left you will see a combined connector for earphones, charger, and data cable. Unfortunately, it is not a miniUSB connector, but a standard Samsung one. Right next to it you will find a slot for a microSD memory card. In the top area of the left side, in the silver strip there is also a key, which switches between the phone and the multimedia side; the presence of such a key is explained with the fact that both sides cannot be active simultaneously. A sliding key lock is located next to the switcher. It is small and hard to move; its activation and deactivation might require the use of a finger nail. In the top left corner there is an eye-let for a wrist band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Sliding keypad lock and a side-switcher ? hidden behind the cover is a slot for a microSD memory card and a multi-functional connector  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card slot can be found under one of the covers (firmly fastened to the body of the phone, just like all other covers) on the right side of the phone. The SIM card is inserted just like any memory card. Yet, remember to push it deeply inside the phone; for this purpose you can use a sharp object. A sharp object will also come handy for the removal of the cover of the external antenna connector located nearby as well as for the reset of the phone provided by a press on the button behind the tiny hole. The dual volume-control key can be found on this side, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;     SIM card is inserted into a slot similar to memory card slots ? dual volume-control key next to the hidden reset button  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of Samsung F300?s body is bare. Its bottom, however, features a connector for the second battery integrated in an elegant case made of leather imitation. The case, which successfully protects both sides of the phone, is enclosed in the retail package. Samsung P310 had a similar case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Samsung F300 inside its case ? there is a battery built in one of the case sides ? a connector for charging from the case  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone slides smoothly into the case till it is stopped by two locks on the bottom. The design of the case provides comfortable access to both phone sides. If you insert the phone into the case when its battery is low, it will start charging automatically using the second battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Work with the phone while it is inside the case is seamless ? both sides are easy to reach  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is built into the phone so it can only be replaced in a specialized repair service shop. It is a Li-Ion battery with 720 mAh capacity. It is supposed to provide Samsung F300 with enough energy for 155 hours on stand-by or 150 minutes of calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     An ease-off key that permits the extraction of the phone ? a holder for the top edge of the phone ? the sides are not protected at all  </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phone side: brilliant keypad with a too small display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone part of Samsung F300 is made for common phone use. The first thing that will strike you is the pronounced size disproportion between keypad and display. A lot of space has been reserved for the keypad, which has resulted in its supreme quality. The functional part of the keypad is dominated by a four-way navigation key with a confirming center. Around it there is a pair of context keys as well as keys for start and termination of calls, a ?C? correction key, and a camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;   &nbsp;     The manufacturer has found a nice solution for the numerical keypad ? key size is virtually ideal ? the main control element is the navigation key in the top area of the keypad  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is so good that it has deserved a compliment from each member of our team. Numerical keys are distributed in compact horizontal bars, between which there is not much space, either. All keys respond confidently without giving any louder sound. They have low uplift, but their touch distinctiveness could have been better. Typing mistakes are very rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;     Touch orientation and control could have been designed in a better way ? the tiny display on the ?phone? side  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you are not going to like is the small size of the display. You will be able to see only two lines of text, which can easily make you feel as if you have made a 10-year jump back in time. The TFT display measures 33 x 13 mm and shows 262K colors. Its resolution is 176 x 64 pixels, which, given the small size of the display, guarantees quite fine images. Legibility under direct sun-light is great. Colors are vivid. If the display remains inactive for some time, its backlight gets turned off. Missed events can only be checked by waking up the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     White backlighting is even; brightness is great  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia side: large display with unusual control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you need more fun, flip the phone over and face the display on the opposite side. It?s way bigger and has a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. It supports the same amount of colors as the small display. Images are smooth and fine; nevertheless, we think that a QVGA resolution on the surface of 33 x 42 mm would have suited this display better. The colors showed on the big display are as vivid as those on the small one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      It does not look like a phone, does it? ? the sensor control button is not the best solution  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display there is a standard control button with a confirming center. In order to make the design of the phone?s multimedia side similar to the design of common portable players the manufacturer has decided to use a touch sensitive type of navigation. This choice does not seem to be the most suitable one, though. The touch sensitive keys are way too sensitive and thus their reaction to pressing is sometimes a bit delayed. The right and the left keys are used for moving within the menu in horizontal direction. The top key opens the context menu, while the bottom one sends you a level back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     The phone belongs to the Ultra Special edition ? backlighting on the multimedia side  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from using standard pressing, you can also control Samsung F300 by sliding your fingers along the edges of the sensor button in both horizontal and vertical directions. You may find this new option especially handy when you browse through the menu or open the context menus, but eventually you will see that it is not really fluent. The phone sometimes confuses sliding with presses. Stopping at the right item in the menu may be a challenging task too. The phone offers practical custom help, supposed to teach you how to work with the sensor button. Whatsoever, bear in mind that we have been testing a pre-market edition of Samsung F300. Sensor control in the final version of the phone could be much better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Both control and interface require sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the ?phone? side shows all necessary details when on stand-by. On the left you will see battery state, signal intensity, and the icon of the active Bluetooth. Time, date and weekday are all located on the right. The background of the stand-by display can be either white, or black, in accordance to the selected menu color. The display is not set to show images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     The stand-by display is offered in two color versions  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessed through the left context key. The right context key opens the phonebook. The main menu can only be shown in the form of a horizontal bar of icons. The icons are not accompanied by legends because of the lack of space. Sub-menu levels only contain text. Work in the menu is generally difficult due to the fact that there are only two visible lines. Like other Samsung models, F300 remembers the last visited menu directory and offers it as a priority one the next time the menu is accessed. The use of shortcut keys significantly speeds up menu operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     The main menu in the form of a bar with icons  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ways of the navigation key can provide instant access to one of the available 15 functions if set to do so. Not so comfortable is the fact that, on stand-by, the confirming center of the navigation key (which otherwise does confirm selection in the menu), opens the home page of the WAP browser, which automatically leads to the activation of the opposite side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Menu in white ? sub-menus  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia part of Samsung F300 also has its menu, but its design is not really attractive, either; it contains 5 items: music player, camera, album, FM radio, and voice recorder. It does not feature many colors: just white icons distributed on a violet background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Switching from one side to another  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>After some time of inactivity the phone switches to power saving mode. The display switches off, no matter which side is active. Missed events can only be checked by unlocking the phone. Here you might face one important difficulty: you may not remember which side was last active so you will not know which display will light up. At the same time the phone can only be activated by pressing the button on the last active side. So prepare for inevitable frequent rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Two items from the multimedia menu  </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook?s capacity is 1000 contacts. Each contact can be assigned a number of fields, for example: first name, last name, 5 phone numbers, email address, picture, ringtone, and a note. Contacts can be organized in call groups. Browsing through the phonebook on the small display is not a pleasant activity. The first line shows contact?s name, while the second one is reserved for gradual typing and searching. The contacts from both the phone memory and the SIM card are showed together. The phonebook can also be searched on the big display on the multimedia side of the phone, but it cannot be edited there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Phonebook menu ? only one item can be seen in the phonebook at a time      &nbsp;     Contact details ? call registers  </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;    Call groups  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has neither an answering machine, nor an option for call filtering. Ringing profiles are substituted by a silence mode and the phone is not able to ring and vibrate simultaneously. Nevertheless, ringing features 64 voices and is of high quality. The phone rings using melodies in any of the following formats: MP3, AAC, and WMA. Samsung F300 works in three GSM frequencies: 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz. 3G networks are not supported. An offline mode allowing the use of the phone on an airplane is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     You can browse the phonebook using the big display on the multimedia side too, but you can not edit it  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Creating messages on the small display is no fancy activity, either. There are only two message types available: SMS and MMS. Samsung F300 does not have an email client. SMS are typed on two lines. The phone will also allow you to see and check your messages on the other, bigger display, but it will not let you modify them. Characters are counted from the number 1836 down and, of course, you will always be alerted of the start of a new sub-message. T9 has a rich dictionary. Thanks to the available EMS standard you can insert images or melodies in your SMS as well as format their text. Messages can be sent to 20 phone numbers at a time. An instant access to the last message recipients is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Messages menu ? a list of delivered messages  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since only two lines are available for message reading too, you should better read them on the opposite-side display ? it is far more comfortable. Received SMS and MMS share one and the same folder. There are 10 preset message alerts available in the phone, so you will have to choose one of them. New message alerts can be repeated every one or two minutes until you read the corresponding message. Samsung F300 is able to save up to 200 SMS and 3 megabytes of MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Both typing and reading SMS is done in mere two lines          Creation of MMS by using the menu ? a view at a MMS  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a special menu for insertion of subjects, texts, images, or videos and sounds, which eases the creation of MMS. The maximum size of each MMS is user-configurable and can be either 95KB, or 295KB. Ready messages can be controlled on both the small and the big displays. The phone also offers a SOS type of message meant to warn a number of preset recipients that the owner of Samsung F300 is being in an emergency situation or in danger and that he needs help. SOS messages are sent out instantly by a four quick presses on the side volume-control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      View at a received SMS and at a SMS typed on the multimedia display ? MMS  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar integrated in Samsung F300 is very simplified. It only offers a day view because of the small size of the display. You can insert three types of events: appointment, anniversary, and task. There are only 100 entries for each type of event in the phone memory. Tasks can be assigned a priority and marked-off once accomplished. Appointments can be repeated daily, weekly, or monthly. You can set the phone to notify you about upcoming events in advance. You can filter the events by their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     The calendar offers a day view only  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Editing an event          Voice recorder ? World time application  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a total of three repeated alarm clocks in Samsung F300. Setting an alarm on a particular day of the week is not possible. The only available setting option is to skip weekends or perhaps Sundays. In this new Samsung experiment you will also find a 1-hour limited voice recorder, a world time application, a stopwatch with mean times, countdown, and text notes, whose maximum length is 100 characters. The phone does not have a calculator, which is rather strange.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>      Text note ? stopwatch with mean times   </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Non-traditional camera location<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is built in a rather unusual place: above the tiny display on the phone side. The reason for this peculiarity is that the big display on the opposite side of the phone serves as a viewfinder. You can use the small display for self-portraits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Camera view-finder ? one of the camera menus  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers two megapixels, which means that the maximum possible image size is 1600 x 1200 pixels. Image quality is surprisingly high, given the absence of autofocus. Pictures are sharp and colors are deep. Although Samsung F300 is not good at making macro images, you should have no problems to read text captured with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The phone display helps you to create self-portraits  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers a wide range of setup options. You can modify image size and quality as well as adjust exposure compensation, set the white balance and define ISO sensitivity. It is also possible to activate the self-release function, apply night mode and use different color effects or frames. A pleasant surprise is the availability of a full-functioning good-quality digital zoom. The viewfinder may occupy either the entire display (but you will not be able to see the entire resulting image) or just part of its surface equivalent to the real size of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sample pictures taken with Samsung F300: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;    &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;           Use of color effects: samples       &nbsp;     Digital zoom interpolates images leaving them in full resolution           Exposure compensation  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Night mode: off ? on           Images with frames only have 176 x 144 pixels  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We appreciate the fact that Samsung F300 shoots videos in MP4 format in QVGA resolution, that is, 320 x 240 pixels. Video length is only limited by the available free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     File manager ? memory state indicator          Viewing images on the small display can only serve for orientation  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures and videos are saved in the internal memory. If you want them to be stored on the memory card, it will be necessary that you move them manually. All multimedia files can be displayed in ?File manager? on the phone side or in the folder ?Album? on the multimedia side. In any case they are grouped by type and types are separated one from another. The content of the memory card appears apart from the phone memory. Pictures can be displayed in fullscreen mode, zoomed, or organized in a slide show. An option for sending pictures to another device via Bluetooth is available, as well. It is a pity, however, that Samsung F300 manages images pretty slowly, which ? in addition to the touch sensitive keys ? leads to a poor overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;     Images can also be viewed in the folder ?Album? on the opposite side of the phone  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album serves as a video player compatible with MP4 and 3GP formats, too. Records can be rewinded or forwarded or even displayed fullscreen. The superior Samsung models F500 and F510 are those primarily designed for work with videos, though. They are said to even offer the DivX format support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Video player has all necessary functions  </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Have fun listening to music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F300, as its name Ultra Music reveals, is primarily meant to serve as a music player. Yet, not even in terms of music has it been brought to perfection. There is a music player on the multimedia side of the phone only. It opens and plays MP3, WMA, AAC, eAAC, and eAAC+ formats. You can listen to music with a minimized music player only if you have switched to the opposite side. For example, it is not possible to listen to music and browse images from the Album simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Music player ? orientation in sub-menus is rather complicated  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player offers a wide range of setup options, but it contains plenty of submenus, so it will take you some time before you get accustomed to it. There is no doubt that you will have to master the uncomfortable sensor keys, too. Repeat and Shuffle options as well as stereo widening are available. There is an equalizer for sound tuning too. Music files can be sorted by name, artist, album, genre and number of runs. Thanks to the last mentioned criteria the phone can automatically offer a playlist with the most frequently played songs. You can create playlists of your own, of course, but you will surely have hard times naming them because of the not-very-precise sensor button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Songs can be sorted by a number of criteria  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone takes music files from either the internal phone memory, whose size is approximately 100 MB, or from the memory card (but only if files are located in the folder ?Music?, otherwise the phone will not find them). The quality of the original earphones enclosed in the retail package is more or less identical to that of earphones sold with cheap MP3 players. In the middle of the cable of the earphones you will see a tiny box with a microphone, a key for accepting calls, and an antenna for the radio. Right here you can disjoint the cable and plug your own earphones in the standard 3.5 mm jack. Samsung F300 can also produce music via its good quality speaker or into stereo Bluetooth earphones thanks to the available A2DP profile. If the phone is inside its case and both its batteries are fully charged, its music player will manage to constantly play into the earphones at a medium volume level for the unbelievable 35 hours!</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Earphones are plugged into a connector on the left side of the phone ? you can use your favourite earphones as well  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F300 has a FM radio ? an essential component for any music phone. All detected stations can be saved into the memory positions available in the phone either manually, or automatically. The radio does not offer RDS service. The last function of the multimedia side worth mentioning is the voice recorder, which is rather similar to the one integrated on the phone side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Radio main display and its menu ? voice recorder is identical to the one on the phone side  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No Java support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F300 does not support Java. After all, games would have been too difficult to play on such a small display, while on the multimedia display control would have been extremely hard, if not impossible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Equipped with EDGE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers are backed by GPRS and EDGE both Class 10. For shorter distances you may want to use Bluetooth or a data cable. However, no one could inform us, not even the people from Samsung call center, whether the phone would be delivered with an enclosed data cable or not. According the phone?s menu, Mass Storage should appear as soon as the phone has been connected to a computer. One of the peculiarities in Samsung F300 is the support of MTP (Media Transfer Protocol), which allows copying files through Windows Media Player, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    WAP browser menu  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As soon as you activate the WAP browser, the phone will automatically switch to its multimedia side so that you can enjoy your browsing on a bigger display. Along with other options here you can also deactivate images, sounds, and JavaScript. There are three font sizes to choose from.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>For experiment lovers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is out of question that some of you will like and embrace the idea of a dual face phone. Most of you will soon find out, though, that the originality of such an idea has a cost much too high. Samsung F300?s small size and high-quality keypad with spacey keys are its only advantages. There are far more drawbacks, though: small display, non-ergonomic controls, absence of Java, etc. Above all, Samsung F300 is designed for people who like to be different from the mass and love innovations. In this sequence of thoughts we definitely cannot recommend it to people in need of an easily controlled multimedia phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     &nbsp;      Samsung F300 is not a common phone  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F300 is already being sold in Internet stores for approximately 330 euros. The black version showed in our review is expected to be soon followed by colorful and more cheerful models.</paragraph>
