			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has high hopes for the LTE packing Galaxy Note I717 in the United States. Since its launch during CES, the AT&amp;T exclusive device has enjoyed a marketing push like no other Samsung offering to date, including the Galaxy S II lineup. It appeared in a Super Bowl commercial, it starred in New York's Fashion week, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The subject of this review is yet another case of an international Samsung device, gone through a character makeover before hitting the U.S. shores. To be in line with its American siblings, the I717 features four touch sensitive buttons under its screen. A Snapdragon S3 chipset with two 1.5GHz Scorpion cores has replaced the capable Exynos silicon of the global version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes however are not in any case a downgrade. LTE connectivity has been added and with a 5.3" Super AMOLED screen and an S Pen on board, the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 has a market niche of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a look at the key features of the Note I717.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the AT&amp;T Galaxy Note's spec sheet is long enough to satisfy even the most demanding users. As far as the phoneblet's disadvantages go, the substitution of the powerful Exynos chipset for a Qualcomm made one is probably the biggest letdown in the U.S. Galaxy Note. The Snapdragon S3 is simply not as powerful. You do however, get LTE connectivity thanks to it - a nice way to ease the pain over the lost oomph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, does the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 have what it takes to make people ditch their current smartphones and tablets for a device, which tries to do it all? Read on to find out. As always, we will begin with an unboxing, followed by design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare bones retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the retail box of the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 is quite small. Inside, you will find a charger and microUSB cable, as well as the usual booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note's retail package is yet another example of a seriously negative trend, which has begun recently. Too often, we see essential accessories such as headphones and/or memory cards omitted from the retail boxes of the carrier branded devices. We hope this will not be the future norm in the industry.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have never been particularly bold with the design of the smartphones in their U.S. lineup and the Galaxy Note I717 is no exception. The device has ditched the hardware home key of its global relative and looks like a stretched out member of the Galaxy S II family - not a bad thing, we think. The device looks simple, but definitely not understated due to its sheer size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality holds no surprises as well. The device is put together from high quality plastic in order to keep its weight in check. Going heavy on the metal would have simply made it impossible for the phoneblet to sit comfortably in your pocket. The screen is protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass, so scratches are highly unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the Samsung Galaxy Note size, there are two approaches to it. Its measures of 146.8 x 83 x 9.7 mm, coupled with 178 grams of weight, qualify the handset as huge by any smartphone standards. If you look at the I717 as a tablet however, the perspective changes completely. It is easier to carry around than any tablet, without (mostly) compromising on functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.3" Super AMOLED screen of the Galaxy Note I717 is simply gorgeous. It gives you 800x1280 pixels of infinite contrast and blacks. It can be quite power efficient too - as long as you use predominantly black backgrounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benefits of such a display are clear in every aspect of the handset's functionality. Multimedia and gaming are a pleasure, and so are web browsing and typing. You can see our in depth inspection of it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, you will find the typical for all U.S. Samsung Android smartphones four touch sensitive keys. Above the display is where the front-facing camera, earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors reside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker of the Galaxy Note is located on its left side. Using it with one hand is a rather tricky exercise. The power/lock key is located on the right side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm audio jack is located on the top of the I717. A secondary microphone keeps it company. The microUSB port and mouthpiece can be found on the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens has the LED flash by its side on the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note. A tiny latch for removing the battery cover resides here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen compartment is in the bottom left corner. We'd like to mention here is that the S Pen itself is rather hard to pull out. It is better this way than being too loose and likely to fall off and get lost. The loudspeaker grille is here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the battery cover of the Galaxy Note I717. There, you will find the beefy 2500mAh battery, along with the SIM and microSD card covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 did slightly better than its global relative in our battery test by achieving a score of 40. This means that we've rated the phone as needing a recharge every 40 hours if you use it for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day. A different usage pattern will likely change this number, but our controlled test criteria makes it easy to compare to other smartphones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the full breakdown of the handset's battery test performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you end up having the device however, it is likely that you'll use it quite heavily. We easily managed a full day on a single charge, despite keeping the device busy a lot longer than in our controlled battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Galaxy Note takes some getting used to. One handed operation is quite tricky - you are setting yourself up for an unpleasant accident. We will highly recommend that you hang on to the device with two hands when playing around with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, there were no surprises in the design and build quality of the I717. The device feels solid and ready to take a beating in the hands of a heavy user. Difficult one handed operation is hardly a surprise. It is still an acceptable price to pay for having such a gorgeous screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to take a look at the software of the phoneblet. Don't be surprised if things look familiar here - the device is practically identical to the global version, which we have already examined in depth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with the phone version of Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread and the home-baked TouchWiz 4.0 launcher out of the box. Its changed look is down to the fact that the WXGA resolution can accommodate more stuff on some screens but, for the most part, it's identical to what you get on a Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note comes with a somewhat different design for the lockscreen from the rest of the Samsung lineup, but it works in just the same way - you can go past it by placing your finger anywhere and swiping in any direction. The lock symbol appears under your finger, placed within two circles. Your swipe has to get out of the outer circle for the screen to unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events get their own notifications on the lockscreen with dedicated icons. If you start your unlocking gesture there you are taken straight to the respective app (call log, messaging center, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is unchanged. Adding widgets to it has the same nice transition effects too, so there's nothing missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some Galaxy Note exclusive widgets, which let you launch the S Pen applications. We'll be looking at them in a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Galaxy S II, the Galaxy Note comes with two cool live wallpapers, developed in cooperation with Accuweather, which display the current weather conditions on the whole screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Think Sense UI weather widget, but on a larger scale. The two different wallpapers in fact only differ by the background - one has a few wind-power propellers, while the other uses a beach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual - you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was some work done on the app toolbar at the bottom. For one, you can now create folders inside it (though given you can have folders on the homescreen, we don't see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, creating folders on the shortcut toolbar is pretty easy stuff - in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create new menu pages in much the same way - browsing your existing ones and picking the icons that you want to have placed on the new page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, the app launcher panes can be rearranged exactly like you would the homescreen - pinch zoom and some swiping around does the trick quickly and intuitively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The added bonus here is that each app drawer pane holds five rows of five icons each instead of the 4x4 grid of the Galaxy S II. The docked icons at the bottom are also five now - both possible thanks to the larger higher-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren't any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, has seen some functional updates. The RAM screen has been modified and there is only one clear memory button now, instead of the two in the previous version. Now, with 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn't hurt having it on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like its smaller Galaxy S II siblings, the Galaxy Note supports gesture controls across the interface. Those include the usual stuff like turn-to-mute or snooze the alarm, as well as tilting your phone to zoom in and out in the gallery or the web browser. You can also turn it sideways to move widgets around the homescreen or icons around the app drawer. To be fair though, we only found the turn to mute really helpful and rarely used any of the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A number of preinstalled AT&amp;T applications come preloaded on the I717. Thankfully however, you can remove most of them manually. On this occasion we must give our thanks to AT&amp;T for allowing this.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is easily the most dramatic feature in the user interface of the Galaxy Not. We know many of you are skeptical about using styli on a capacitive screen, but there's a reason why this one deserved a name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus of the Galaxy Note has been developed by Samsung with the help of Wacom. The company is the premier manufacturer of interactive pen displays, pen tablets, and digital interface solutions, thus giving this unusual accessory some serious credentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is a passive device (as in, it has no battery), but it still offers some extra functionality thanks to the button that's built into the little stick. You can simply use it to replace your finger of course, but that's hardly the point here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real fun starts when the S Pen button comes into play. For starters, if you hold the key and hold the S Pen over any screen of the Note UI, it will make a screenshot and go straight to edit mode, so you can put down notes over that same screenshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can hold the key and double tap on the screen (again it works in any part of the interface) to launch the S Memo Lite pad. That's merely a blank page for you to take notes, draw and whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press of the S Pen key and swipe to the left means back, so you can also navigate the interface with it. If you do the same thing but swipe upwards instead, the context menu will appear, as if you have pressed the left capacitive key. That means that the S Pen allows you to operate your phoneblet without pressing any hardware keys, making Gingerbread an all-touch platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video to give you an idea of the responsiveness and precision of the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen isn't exactly instant, but the kind of precision it offers does the job quite well. There is room for improvement, of course, but even as it is, the fancy stylus opens quite a lot of doors to the Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SDK for the S Pen is already out, so we can reasonably expect specific apps to come out for it in the nearest future. The device already comes with a physics based game, developed specifically for the S Pen, called Crayon Physics. The popular Sketchbook Mobile also supports the S Pen. The app lets you get seriously creative. Here's a quick example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to take a look at the performance of the Snapdragon S3 chipset, and check if it is a worthy replacement of the powerful Exynos silicon, which the N7000 packs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the rest of its Qualcomm packing cousins, regardless of their brand, the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 did quite well in some of the benchmark tests, but fell short of the mark set by the N7000. The truth is that the Exynos chipset of the latter is still the most powerful one out there. Like we mentioned earlier however, you do get LTE on board of the AT&amp;T Galaxy Note, so the trade off is well justified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance benchmarks aside, we found the Galaxy Note I717 to be just a tiny bit laggy, compared to the global version. It is barely noticeable though - you must look really hard with both phones sitting next to each other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around on the Note but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the Galaxy S II. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The U.S. Galaxy Note also features Yellow Pages built-in, which allows you to browse local phone number directories, or look unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note can display your Google, phone, and SIM contacts simultaneously or any subset of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook keeps the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the talent of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is top notch, voice commands work well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn't suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query). We also notice the familiar quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available - a double tap on the Home key activates voice commands. All you need to do is press the large virtual button at the bottom of the screen or say "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "text Dexter").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the Vlingo-powered service applications stretch well beyond voice calling and texting. You can use it to start your applications, dictate notes, set up appointments, update your social status, start navigation and whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy family voice commands are more of a direct competitor of the Siri service that Apple promoted so heavily on the iPhone 4S. The customized Vlingo services carries the benefits of further-fetching functionality and better work with accents, plus the fact that it doesn't carry the US-only restrictions found on the iPhone. However, it lacks the natural language commands support - you need to keep to a strict syntax here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging like a Swiss Army knife<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping over a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger - as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically transformed into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. The top row holds two labels - the first is the name of the inbox you're currently viewing (tap to change the inbox) and the one next to it is the name of the current folder (again, tap to change it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone landscape activates the split view - the left side of the screen shows the list of emails, while the right side shows a message. This feature is present on the Galaxy S II as well, but it makes much more sense here as only a screen as large as this allows you to read comfortably by only using two thirds of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note I717 gives you a whopping three options for text entry. You have the standard Samsung keyboard, which now (unsurprisingly) utilizes the S Pen for handwriting as well. In case it doesn't cut it for you, there is the plain vanilla Android keyboard, as well as Swype at your disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you - aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there's nothing new really. And don't you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing your images over just about anything is a couple of clicks away. If you have setup social network accounts you can also post your images straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note uses the standard TouchWiz music player, which is pretty good news as we cannot think of a feature that it lacks, save for automatically generated album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nice music-based visualization with the bars moving on the screen and you can easily share any track you are listening to over mail, Wi-Fi, or any of the social networks you have set up on the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>One of the best video players is at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There's 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (move them back or forward a few seconds) but there's no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either - the Samsung Galaxy Note played FullHD files with ease. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, with a screen that big and resolution this high the Galaxy Note makes a great portable video player. You just transfer the videos to it (which is quite easy too) and enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash and 28mm wide-angle lens but, unfortunately, no shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the same module that you get on the Galaxy S II and as you know that one is still among the best 8 megapixel shooters out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is identical, too, with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get five controls by default but the good news is that you can pick any shortcuts to put there - commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy Note offers quite a lot - touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. The list goes on, but those are the ones that really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is really nice with plenty of resolved detail, great edge-to-edge sharpness, nice contrast and moderately saturated colors. Check out the samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video doesn't disappoint either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The front mounted camera can record video too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiar thing to note is that when shooting FullHD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. The explanation is that the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and then scale it down to 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 720p video capture mode however they use the whole sensor and as a result you have almost the same wide field of view as the still camera (about 30mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually helps suppress digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a hand-rest while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S FullHD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is smooth, though a bit slow at times. Stereo recording is also appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in MP4 format. We have prepared a couple of camera samples for you. Don't forget to click 1080p on the Full HD video sample and open the video full screen to really appreciate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched 1080p video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're really pleased with the video quality. There's an amazing level of resolved detail, the framerate is solid 30fps. The videos turn out nice and crisp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files have a bitrate of 17Mbps; sound is recorded in stereo at 128Kbps and a sampling rate of 44 KHz. There's a price to be paid for the higher bitrate though. A minute of FullHD video would take up around 120MB of storage space so that makes a 10-minute clip well over a gigabyte. Plus, low-spec'd computers will have a hard time playing it. It's still bearable though considering that a 10-minute video by the iPhone 4S takes up something in the lines of 1.8GB.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has more options than you will ever need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T's brand new LTE network is the highlight of the Galaxy Note I717 list of connectivity options. We've tested it out in the New York City area, and the speeds came out quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case LTE is not at available, quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G are here for you. There's HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as "4G" even though it's not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds of up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn't give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those are quite hard to get by, which is pretty disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy Note screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straight forward - you plug it into the Galaxy Note and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is one of Galaxy Note's elements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy Note propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes surfing a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, Find On Page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best parts of the Android ecosystem is that even if you don't like the default browser there's nothing to worry about. The Android market offers more alternatives than any of its competitors - there's Opera Mobile and Mini, Dolphin HD, SkyFire and many more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There is an office editor for the overly productive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 comes with the Polaris Office preinstalled, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess - it's one of the most feature rich mobile editors we've seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there's a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing covers an almost full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that's a first). If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells, and so on. Even full-featured PowerPoint presentations are doable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A full blown organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note organizer has been redesigned, to make maximum use of the S Pen. The calendar offers seven different types of view, instead of the usual four. There is now a three-day view agenda and tasks right in the calendar app, instead of needing separate apps for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. We found the agenda view, which shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future, particularly useful for organizing your time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. You can adjust text size and use cut, copy and paste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 features a great alarm clock application as well, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. You can also activate a Smart alarm for each of them, which will activate a pre-set amount of minutes (between 3 and 30) before the main alarm and wake you up gently by starting off quiet and gradually increasing the volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual Memo app has been replaced by S Memo, which lets you use the S Pen for taking notes, as if you have an actual notepad on your hands. The S Pen has plenty of useful tools for that and works quite smoothly, so you will hardly ever end up making memos on the Note the old-fashioned way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the Mini Diary, which lets you also attach pictures and locations to your notes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note I717 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We didn't experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (and even larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, your money be better spent on a good app rather than a dedicated SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America. It is still in Beta though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market gets better as time goes by<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and powerful graphics chip, the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.6 and there will be an ICS update before a huge number of apps for this one accumulates, so you won't have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure that you won't be having a shortage of software to install on your Galaxy Note. True, some apps aren't designed to work on a WXGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If by some reason, the soon-to-become number 1 app repository on the market isn't enough for you, you might want to check out some of the alternatives. Amazon has set up its own appstore and so has Opera, plus a few more minor app stores here and there. Choice is one of the best parts of the open platform.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, there is nothing else like the Samsung Galaxy Note I717 on the U.S. market at the moment. The Korean giant deserves a lot of credit for carving a new niche in a market, which is seriously saturated with all sorts of smartphones and tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We love the screen of the device and its speedy LTE network. The S Pen can be surprisingly handy and entertaining as well. The rest of the device's functionality is unsurprisingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of the Exynos chipset from the global version cannot be left unnoticed. The AT&amp;T Galaxy Note simply does not have the raw power of the original. It offers you LTE instead and, we believe, that the trade-off will still be in your favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are the type of person, who lugs around a smartphone and a tablet simultaneously, the Galaxy Note might just be the phone for you. The I717 gives you the opportunity to save a lot of space by having a device, which (almost) does it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are simply looking for a smartphone, the best advice we can give you is to go to an AT&amp;T store, and try out the device yourself. It is the best way to find out whether it will be comfortable enough, as any other opinion will be quite subjective - there is simply nothing like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or maybe there is one. If you are an AT&amp;T customer, and live in an area with no LTE coverage, it is worth considering the Galaxy Note N7000. It is faster, looks different than all other U.S. only Samsung smartphones, and will offer you the same excellent functionality. Keep in mind however, that you will have to go with an unlocked device, which will set you back considerably more than the $299.99 contract price of the I717. Regarding the N7000, we are quite sure Samsung won't mind if you choose it over the I717.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are curious to see how the Galaxy Note is going to perform in the U. S. market, where large screens are more or less the norm. The phoneblet is big, bold, and like nothing else - a formula, which will likely serve it well.</paragraph>
