			<paragraph>No catch here, we've finally managed to finish up our grandest of camera shootouts including the most popular 5 megapixel cameraphones that are currently on sale. We've put Sony Ericsson K850, Nokia N95 8GB, LG KU990 Viewty, and Samsung G600 in a head-to-head collision course in order to find out who's best when it comes to pure camera-centric performance. We'll also be including a guest star - the Nokia N82, for one of our tests - as it produces the same shots as the Nokia N95 8GB, the only difference being the xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may or may not remember our teaser article or more of a blindfold test in which we presented you sample photos produced by the competing cameraphones without disclosing their identity. We had our visitors vote for choosing the best one among them with all brand prejudice aside. We got some interesting results there that didn't quite match our view on the matter. The Nokia N95 8GB came first, Samsung G600 was chosen in second place, followed by LG Viewty and the last place was taken by Sony Ericsson K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we do agree that Nokia N95 8GB is superior in image quality, we will try to convince you that Sony Ericsson K850 and the LG Viewty are not that bad and that Samsung G600 is not that good as perceived by our visitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are some points to be made before we jump to the details of our in-depth camera review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We want to point out that all the handsets we've used in this shootout are final retail versions, so odds are they will put their best effort to all make a run for the gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, unless stated otherwise, all camera settings are left on auto, while the resolution selected is 5 megapixels and quality is set at its highest level. We decided using the full auto mode for shooting since most users shoot photos with their phones set on auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some of the test samples we've also included photos taken with a digital camera - the Canon A620. We chose to use a consumer digital camera as a reference instead of a DSLR for two reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, it's easier to frame the shots the same way, because the consumer digital cameras have the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, the DSLR results will be really different from those of the reviewed cameraphones. The DSLR-s cameras are tuned to preserve as much image information as possible and this is why they are too conservative for such a comparison. The consumer cameras, like Canon A620 in most cases add some punch to the photos, just enough for the images to be more lively and more likeable. It's easy to see that cameraphones try to do the same - produce images, which are pleasant and vivid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and one more point - you're probably wondering why the heck we haven't included the Nokia N82 and the Samsung G800 as fully-fledged contenders. Well, for one the Nokia N82 produces exactly the same photos as the Nokia N95 8GB as we managed to personally confirm. There is the added benefit of a xenon flash, of course, but we'll take that into account - the Nokia N82 will be standing its ground in the flash comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for two, the Samsung G800 just wasn't available in the office at the time we did the test shots, but we have a pretty good idea of what it's capable of. So you will see the Samsung G800 mentioned here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably we should also mention what camera shootouts are all about. There are several important factors that determine camera image quality and we will structure our article accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Breaking down the image quality we look for resolved detail, dynamic range, color accuracy, internal image processing and lens quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's more to a camera than image quality. It's really important how the camera software handles exposure, auto focus, shooting in low light, and shooting up-close macro photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some extra goodies of a camera that also get tested in our shootout such as the value-adding features, the flash performance and the pure speed of the process of taking photos from A to Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since we do more with a cameraphone than just take pictures, we also evaluate the video capturing capabilities of our contestants plus their multimedia galleries used for browsing all the images taken with the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see there's a lot to write about, so bear with us and join us after this very break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Some sample images<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Resolved detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've spent a lot of time looking at the images at different magnifications on the screen and it's still hard to announce a clear winner here. The main obstacle here is the amount of sharpness applied in the post processing, which can easily be mistaken as detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of you might not agree, but we think that Samsung G600 delivers slightly less details than the rest, while Nokia N95 delivers slightly more. Anyway, the results are pretty close to a tie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 5/10 ? LG Viewty: 6/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 6/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dynamic range<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is a very important aspect of the photo quality of each camera. There is no way to fix the blown highlights (the parts of the image that have turned white), which are the most prominent result of the limited dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By far, the worst performer here is Samsung G600. We are not sure if this is because of an inferior sensor used, or because of the artificially high contrast applied in the post processing, but G600 loses more details in the highlights than the other contenders. There is not a big difference among the other three, but our opinion Nokia N95 performs slightly better than Viewty and K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 2/10 ? LG Viewty: 5/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Color accuracy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We will use our Canon A620 samples to judge the color accuracy of the 5 megapixel contenders. As we've already mentioned A620 is not the most accurate camera in terms of color representation, but it's pretty close to what the consumer wants - pleasant and vivid images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In most of the samples, Nokia N95 8GB is closer to A620 than the rest of the phones. Samsung G600 comes second, but while it masters the hue, it oversaturates the general colorfulness of the image (otherwise known as chroma).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 and LG Viewty are on par with each other, but compared to Canon A620, their results are too red - an effect, which is a little more pronounced in Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 6/10 ? LG Viewty: 3/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 4/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internal processing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The way the camera processes the images is more important than it sounds. Even the best processing can't create miracles from a small sensor and cheap lens, but wrong processing can ruin the results from even the best hardware. (For years the exact processing routines are the best kept secret in the digital camera industry. Often, competing brands use essentially the same sensor and similar lens in competing models and good processing is the only way to have an edge with the image quality)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From what we see in the samples, Samsung G600 is the only camera, which scores particularly bad in this test - it oversharpens the images and that ruins the image for further editing. In the case of G600 the oversharpened also draws attention to the overexposed areas of the photos, by emphasizing the edge around these areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get excessive amount of jagged diagonal lines, also known as a "staircase" effect. Overall, the images by G600 look a lot more like what we expect from photos taken by a phone, than the competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N95 8GB uses an effective noise suppression technique. The main difference we see comparing it to the N95 classic is that the noise suppression was tuned down and now it's a lot harder to find example of a photo, where some detail is lost because of the noise processing. Have in mind that this has also been fixed in the N95 classic with one of the latest firmware updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 also uses noise suppression routine, but it is less intelligent than the one of N95 and in certain places it simply eradicates the really fine details. You can see how much details are sometimes lost in our G800 review. The noise suppression algorithm also sometimes has a problem with the edge detection thus removing significant amount of detail in low contrast areas of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty just processes the images "less" than the contenders. You can see more noise in the shadow areas and the images don't have the "punch" N95 images have. This approach however is best if you plan to edit the images on the computer later, but we are not quite sure how much of the cameraphone owners do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Samsung G800 was participating in this test, it would have deserved a sure 10 as in our opinion the processing there is just right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 2/10 ? LG Viewty: 6/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 8/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exposure and focus accuracy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's quite important to have reliable automatics, because wrong parameters can ruin an otherwise promising photo. For the score here, we just browse all the taken photos and count the bad results (which you don't see published).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were literally no mis-focused images, which speaks well for all contenders. The most frequent problem we saw was over exposure and Samsung G600 and LG Viewty did this more often than K850 and N95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 6/10 ? LG Viewty: 6/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 9/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 8/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lens quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When low quality (read: cheaper) lens are used in any camera, that can bring a host of troubles such as barreling or pin cushioning, lens flare when shooting against the a strong light source, purple fringing along the edges of fine elements such as tree or bush branches, and finally corner softness, which is a case of uneven corner-to-corner sharpness along the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we are satisfied with the results here - none of the tested cameraphones exhibited significant amount of corner softness. We only saw some heavy cases of purple fringing with the Sony Ericsson K850 and the LG Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 also did show some purple fringing but it didn't show up in every photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 6/10 ? LG Viewty: 4/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 4/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we promised, we bring on Nokia N82 for this test. As you see it outperforms the rest of the phones in this test by a wide margin. It features a stronger flash and this is clearly seen - it doesn't need to boost the sensitivity (and add noise along it) to produce the well lit pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparison here is somewhat tricky. Two of our contenders (Samsung G600 and Nokia N95 8GB) have LED lights, while the rest feature xenon flash units. The xenon lights are a lot stronger, but they can only produce impulses (typical speed is 1/1000 sec). The LED flash are a lot weaker, but they can still deliver significant amount of light by staying on for a lot longer, for example 1/5 sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This should explain why G600 produces well lit photos, it just keeps the shutter open and the LED for a lot longer than the xenon mobiles. You can take a passable photo in the dark with such mobile, but you can't freeze the action as with Sony Ericsson K850 and Nokia N82 for example. So you are likely to take a blurry shot, unless your subjects sit still. Nokia N95 8GB gets low score here, because it produces uneven light, you can see it against the white wall. And finally, we are quite disappointed with the LG Viewty results here - those are some very weak results for a xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 3/10 ? LG Viewty: 3/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 2/10 ? SE K850: 6/10 ? Nokia N82: 9/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ISO test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Testing the camera performance in low light is a bit hard. When shooting in low light conditions, the cameras drastically decrease the shutter speed in order to capture more light. That means motion blur is very likely to occur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's easy to deal with it when you have a real camera - you just use a tripod. In the case of camera phones however we don't have that option. Thus a low light cameraphone test might be misleading if our hand trembles with one of the contenders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we decided to give you an ISO test instead. Because the cameraphones boost the ISO in low light, this test will give you a very good idea how they will behave in the dark with flash switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: N/A ? LG Viewty: 3/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Macro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you see from our samples LG KU990 Viewty is superior in this test. For some reason it just has a better field of view (it keeps more details in focus). In addition to this, Viewty offers manual focus, which can be of great help when shooting low contrast scene or a dynamic macro scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other contenders, relying entirely on the auto-focus will be hardly usable in such conditions. Nevertheless, among the other three contenders we tend to favor the Sony Ericsson K850 results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 5/10 ? LG Viewty: 9/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 7/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video recording capabilities, it's a rather easy fight. The Sony Ericsson K850 offers only QVGA@30fps, Samsung G600 VGA@15fps or QVGA@30fps, while the Nokia N95 and LG Viewty - VGA 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewty uses more advanced compression (DIVX) and has a unique 120fps shooting mode, so it was a clear cut winner from the very start. You can see some 120fps samples in the LG KU990 Viewty review here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface: features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera interface plays a big part in the shooting experience. So essentially what it all boils down to is the following: camera features and user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera Features assessment takes into account the features that the camera masters - it includes stuff such as shoot modes (macro, burst, panorama, frame, collage), flash settings, available preset scenes, ISO setting and some other extras such as on-screen guidelines, face detection, manual focus and camera stabilization. We also take into account the actual looks of the camera interface - the eye-candy aspect of things is important too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the User-Friendliness of the interface is probably the more complex thing to assess. It takes into account things such as the way settings are ordered, the available shortcuts for the camera functions, the visual pointers showing the specifics of each setting, etc. It may sound like a subjective assessment, but you have no choice but to rely on our experience with cameraphones and digital cameras and trust our judgment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of Camera features all of our contenders seem to have their own quirks. All of them seem to have a pretty identical set of standard settings such as white balance, adequate preset scene modes, self-timer, color effects, and exposure compensation. Most of them macro shooting modes, while the ones that don't usually don't need it. The Nokia N95 8GB has also a Sharpness and Contrast settings that neither of the others has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ISO setting is available in all cameraphones - it's useful when you want to minimize the noise by flicking it down at the lowest setting or when you want to freeze the action in a low-light environment by flicking it up at the max setting. By the way, if you are a person that refuses to touch any setting that has a fat abbreviation on it, you might as well go with the Scenes shooting modes as they do all the appropriate settings for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash settings are also pretty identical - they all have auto mode and red-eye reduction mode. The Sony Ericsson K850 only suffers a bit from the fact that you cannot use its xenon thingy as fill flash. This setting is needed when you want to use the flash as a fill light for shooting portraits when there is a bright background behind the subject. The same issue goes for LG KU990 Viewty, too. Note that the score doesn't take into account the actual flash performance but only the settings associated with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to Burst mode almost every cameraphone has its own solution. The Sony Ericsson K850 uses the BestPic mode where it takes up to 9 images in a row at the highest resolution. Once they are taken, they are pretty easy for reviewing as the phone doesn't save them before you've chosen the keepers. The Nokia N95 8GB has its Burst mode with up to 6 high-res images however it much slower than the BestPic mode and the phone saves all images before you even have the chance to review them. The Samsung G600 captures up to 15 images in a rapid succession however they are only in QVGA resolution. The LG KU990 Viewty takes up to 10 quick successive shots and the user can choose which ones to save, but they are not taken in the maximum resolution possible but in 1280 x 960 pixels (1 megapixel).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking panorama images is a fun way to capture the full grandeur of landscapes. While it does take some skill taking those shots, all of our contenders made it easier for you by automating the whole process of stitching the images together. The Sony Ericsson K850 takes panorama images of up to three shots but all the shots are taken in VGA resolution - quite inadequate really. The Samsung G600 also has a Panorama mode but again shoots up to three shots in VGA resolution. Nokia N95 8GB is even worse - there is no Panorama mode. You can buy a third-party application that enables it but the individual shots are taken in up to QVGA resolution. The LG Viewty scores best here as its Panorama images consist of three individual shots each with 1 megapixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the cameraphones has its unique feature to make it stand out of the crowd. The Sony Ericsson K850 features a built-in accelerometer that records information in the picture taken so that every image viewing program can rotate it automatically afterwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of accelerometers, the Nokia N95 8GB also has that but there is even more. Thanks to the built-in GPS and some free third-party software you can get your photos geo-tagged or a.k.a. GPS-tagging. Later on when you upload them to a geo-tag-enabled photo sharing website you can show your friends exactly where you have taken those cool shots. Nokia N95 8GB has one more feature that none of the other cameraphones has - it allows taking images at a predefined interval. Those are great for making time-lapse movies of slow moving objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty also has some aces up its sleeves. Beside manual focus, it also offers image stabilization which you can use when taking pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 along with the N95 8GB can visualize a grid overlay on the viewfinder. You can use the grid to help compose your snapshots like a pro - the photography composition rule-of-thirds states that you should place your main subject either along these lines or at the points where they intersect. The rule-of-thirds also applies to landscape shots. There you should have the sky occupying either one third or two thirds of the frame. But having the gridlines is not important enough to bring any changes in the assigned ratings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks are not that important for the camera functionality. We, however, feel that they are an essential element of a make-or-break cameraphone deal. When looking at what our contenders have to offer we pretty much think we have a clear-cut winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks are a subjective matter so everyone should decide for themselves. However we find the Sony Ericsson K850 to be superior in terms of the interface looks. The Samsung G600 is a close second, while the Nokia N95 8GB and the LG KU990 Viewty are next in queue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 5/10 ? LG Viewty: 7/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 7/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface: user-friendliness<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>User-friendliness is the next aspect we assess. You would have no choice but to rely on our experience with cameraphones and digital cameras and trust our judgment, since without a proper study involving focus groups and such, it still remains a highly questionable matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 scores nicely when it comes to user-friendliness. We generally like the whole setup where you have a toolbar with the available settings and all the options come up as pop-ups. The Samsung G600 follows exactly the same pattern, while the Nokia N95 8GB and the LG Viewty stray from that rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With camera settings getting more complex than ever, it's pretty important that all of those should have some straightforward explanation in the camera interface. The settings should also have their names clearly shown, otherwise finding the needed setting turns into a guessing game for an inexperienced user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 manages that requirement with an unexpected ease. The Samsung G600 has clear names for the available settings, but no explanation of what they do. The Nokia N95 8GB has nice explanations for what each individual setting does and there are some tooltips to help you get your way around the main settings toolbar - but only after you highlight an icon. The LG Viewty is the worst of all as most of the settings are represented with icons with not that clear meaning, plus there is no explanation whatsoever - nevertheless we think a touch-based user interface could hardly be laid out any different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a huge amount of settings on that settings toolbar we spoke of earlier is not that user-friendly too. So every cameraphone has a second settings menu that takes care of the least used options. That's ok with us, however picking the right ones to put on the main toolbar is of crucial importance to the user-friendliness of the device's camera. It seems like that all of our contnders have fared great in this respect, so we are calling it a draw here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having the right shortcuts at your disposal is a key thing in order to operate with the camera settings quickly and efficiently. We are used to those on entry-level digital cameras, but mobile phones have much more features than a regular camera and fitting dedicated camera keys is not a feasible task. Yet, all of the handsets allow some sort of shortcutting your way through the most important settings, so that you don't miss that precious opportunist shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 packs some nice backlight icons on the regular alphanumeric keypad so that you know your way around. It's probably the most comfortable solution we've seen so far on a cameraphone. The Samsung G600 also has an extensive list of available shortcuts, however you have to memorize them by heart or use the camera help menu to see who's doing what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N95 8GB camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N95 8GB has no shortcut keys whatsoever except for the digital zoom control. And finally, we can't really expect any hardware shortcuts from the LG Viewty as it doesn't have much hardware keys. Nevertheless, it packs one, which allows you to start the image stabilization mode - and of course there is the ring on the back that allows you to control the manual focus and the digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty, as well as K850, also has a nice dedicated slider for toggling between photo and video capturing. The Nokia N95 8GB has a dedicated key for starting the image gallery, too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 7/10 ? LG Viewty: 4/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 8/10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The LG and Nokia score points in this category are now swapped, as due to a mistake, they were not correct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We all know how good it is to preview your shots as soon as they've been made. It allows you to go immediately for a second shot if something has ruined your composition or you can simply brag about your super cool snapshot to everybody around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to previewing your pictures almost all of the cameraphones score nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 is really fast at image browsing and thanks to the integrated accelerometer it is capable of automatically rotating the images with the change in the handset orientation. The K850 also has a snappy zooming on the photos that works in large steps. The animated slideshows the Sony Ericsson K850 creates are also better than the ones by Nokia - they have intriguing transition effects and nice music background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although we generally dig the animated image gallery of the Nokia N95 8GB, we don't like the fact that zooming is done slowly and in annoyingly small steps. The Nokia N95 8GB however wins our hearts with the large screen and when it comes to legibility under sunlight, Nokia displays have no competition at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N95 8GB, the Sony Ericsson K850 and the LG Viewty all have hardware keys for opening the image gallery which is certainly a plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Viewty however is slower at browsing image files - otherwise it offers a really nice image gallery and once it gets into zooming mode, it's pretty snappy with the zooming and probably the fastest one with panning on zoomed images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shouldn't also forget that it has the largest display among the cameraphones in this shootout. The Viewty also has this so-called Muvee editor that allows making animated slideshows out of your pictures resembling the ones by K850 and even allows you to export them as MPEG4 video files; something the K850 is not capable of doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 boasts the most advanced image gallery that we've seen on a Samsung handset, but with a twist. It only works with images stored in the phone's memory. Browsing the images on the memory card is a real pain - it doesn't have the hoverbox effect seen in the regular image gallery, it's relatively slow and you do have to open/close each image instead of simply going through them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 3/10 ? LG Viewty: 7/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 8/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 8/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of speed, it's again hard to choose a clear winner as times vary according to the scenario. It seems that the fastest camera to boot up is the one of Samsung G600. Then it's the Nokia N95 camera that's the quickest to show the image preview right after the shot has been taken. If you are to take a picture right after you've seen the preview, the LG Viewty camera is the fastest one to take you there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an overall performer the LG Viewty again seems to be the fastest one of the bunch, while the Sony Ericsson K850 is at the bottom of the ladder. The difference though is not that serious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600: 6/10 ? LG Viewty: 8/10 ? Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 ? Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well that's it, the grand 5 megapixel camera shootout is drawing to an end. We will not present any final results - probably contrary to what you've been expecting. If you want to choose your next mobile and it has to be one of these, we suggest that you sum up only the results for the tests that are important to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just in a quick attempt to summarize things, if you want the most universal performer this will surely be the Nokia N95 8GB. With the Nokia N82 you even have a xenon flash and exactly the same camera performance, so you might as well go that way too. Our observations are that the Nokia N82 handles all photo situations as the Nokia N95 and produces the same results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then if your top priority is well thought and capable interface you may chose Sony Ericsson K850. It delivers a superior user experience and feels like a real digital camera at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into video recordings and macro shots, then your choice should be the LG KU990 Viewty. The widescreen touch screen display also counts as it's a unique feature among the contenders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally if you are looking for the best-bang-for-the-buck and reliable performance you might as well go with the Samsung G600. While it's not a fully-fledged cameraphone, it does have its strong points and we shouldn't also forget that it's the most affordable of the bunch.</paragraph>
