		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Creating sub-brands has been one of the preferred strategies used by Chinese manufacturers lately and in today's case ZUK has been backed by none other than the Chinese giant Lenovo with their logo proudly sitting on the ZUK Z1 box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, smartphones have complicated family trees these days. In the case of the ZUK Z1, the company would be quick to testify that even though the technological heritage is there, having a new company run things promises a fresh take on things in a market where new models are barely different from the last. Most importantly, the new tech economy demands a shift in focus towards some unconventional sales channels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of a general push towards Western markets, the number of available Chinese brands of smartphones making their way to Europe and the Americas has been slowly but steadily on the rise. Buying a Chinese brand smartphone no longer means you?re shooting yourself in the foot when it comes to warranty servicing and aftersales support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The influx of Chinese brands has slowly changed our perceptions and high-profile products have helped change the image of Chinese technological products in the eyes of the conservative European user. So the door is wide open for adventurous undertakings such as OnePlus and ZUK and they are not wasting any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Lenovo serves as the parent company its plan is to let ZUK be its own brand. And ZUK is certainly doing its own thing, the Z1 is based on reliable, proven technology instead of trying to reinvent the wheel for the sake of flashy marketing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the ZUK Z1 lacks in buzzwords it makes up for with trusty workhorses. The Snapdragon 801 chipset was chosen as the heart, and Cyanogen OS as the brain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cyanogen OS is still making its first steps but those are promising and the company has been pretty active and ambitious with its own fork of Android AOSP. The chipset used is well proven and an excellent performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old-but-gold theme continues with the camera - Sony's IMX 214 sensor is already used by pretty much every self-respecting mid-ranger, but the ZUK Z1 boasts optical image stabilization to make its camera stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 is not afraid to experiment too, and the company has been quick to jump on the USB Type C bandwagon that has been picking up speed lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's rare to see so many caveats in the disadvantages section. No microSD slot is an automatic point against, but we felt a little bad putting it on the list. It's greedy to want more from a $300 phone with 64GB storage. Same for the battery - it's non-removable, but makes up for it with capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we've properly introduced our guest with a strangely sounding name,we should waste no more time but check up what it has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: we're reviewing the international version of the ZUK Z1, which runs Cyanogen OS. In China, the Z1 will be sold with ZUK's custom ZUI software, which includes a different software package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the ZUK Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 proudly bears the Lenovo logo on its box, perhaps to alleviate any concerns buyers may have when encountering an unknown brand. This is the first ZUK after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box itself has a low profile and it's made from thick cardboard, giving it a sturdy feel. That's a great first impression, though the box contents are pretty standard - charger, USB cable and a SIM ejector tool (no headphones though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger is rated at 5V/2A (the equivalent of Quick Charge 1.0) so there's no fast charge tech to fill the capacious battery. The USB cable is pretty interesting though - it has a reversible USB Type C connector on one end and a regular Type A connector on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is a USB 3.1 cable though, unlike the Nokia N1, for example, which came with a Type C connector but with only USB 2.0 speeds. We'll benchmark USB 2.0 vs. 3.1 data transfers on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZUK Z1 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 measures 155.7 x 77.3 x 8.9mm - a bit smaller than an iPhone 6 Plus, which has the same screen size. It weighs about the same too, but it has a serious lead in battery capacity. The Z1 thickness seems average but actually very few phones manage 4,000+ mAh capacity at under 9mm. And they tend to be flagships too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>White became the color of choice from emerging Asian manufacturers and the ZUK Z1 is no exception. It's available in dark grey too, but promo images show ZUK's preference for the white model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it does look nice with the silvery aluminum frame, our problem is that there are so many white-and-silver smartphones on the market that it's getting hard to tell them apart. ZUK hasn't done anything extravagant with the design, which doesn't help its case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is built around a CNC-machined aluminum (aviation-grade, ZUK is keen to point out) that was taken through 16 procedures and a total of 209 operations with precision of 0.03mm. The frame is not a plate that goes across the phone - it's a frame that runs along the edges of the phone - basically what you see on the outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is to leave more room for the battery, which is made up of two units to maximize the internal volume, while keeping the rounded back. It's similar to what LG did with back the LG G2. The curved back makes the phone feel slimmer (it's 8.9mm only at its thickest point) and is just enough to house the OIS-enabled camera completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of the ZUK Z1 is what you would expect from a phone this size, sturdy but not heavy. The glossy back material is a little slippery though and the smooth aluminum sides do little to help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final point on ergonomics is the positioning of the Home key. It sits fairly low below the screen so you'll have to adjust your grip to reach it with your finger. This key will see plenty of use as it's also the fingerprint reader ("U-Touch").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily it's the touch kind (swipe would not work well) and it recognizes finger at various angles. It's not all perfect though, the key is rather stiff and has a shallow press, it's moderately uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside it are capacitive keys - App switcher and Back - but they are invisible other than two small backlit dots (which are really hard to see on the white Z1).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is an 8MP/1080p selfie camera, which boasts basically the same modes as the main camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone is quite interesting. The USB Type C connector is still fairly new - it's noticeably wider than microUSB 2.0 and slightly thinner. A more fair comparison will be to the failed microUSB 3.0 standard as Type C carries extra pins for faster data transfer and other features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're still not at a level where the Type C connector will limit how thin a phone can be (the 3.5mm audio jack is thicker anyway). Also on the bottom is one of the microphones and the loudspeakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top (there isn't much room for it at the bottom). Along the sides are and the SIM tray, as well as the volume rocker and power key, these sit low and have a very shallow click. The ZUK Z1 takes two nanoSIM cards on a single tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming around to the back, the 13MP camera is near the top edge and below it is a duo of small LEDs. Next to them is the secondary mic, used for stereo audio and noise cancellation. The back is non-removable and a fingerprint magnet, on the upside it didn't have scratches after we were done testing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 has a 5.5" 1080p screen, which under Chinese influence has been turning into the the new golden midrange standard. At 401ppi the screen is sharp and doesn't tax the chipset or the battery like QHD would have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution aside, ZUK did plenty to optimize image quality. We measured the screen at 396 nits and a contrast of about 1,000:1, which is average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Outdoor mode (which can be triggered automatically) changes the screen settings, allegedly to make the screen more legible in the sun. We appreciate the hardware solution more - a polarizing filter that further improves legibility (similar to the ClearBlack tech we've seen on Lumias).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is fairly accurate (Avg deltaE 5.2 for the primary colors plus black and white), with white being not as accurate as we would expect. With a deltaE of 9.9, it's on the colder bluish side, but you would hardly notice that unless you get some sort of a reference to compare it side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, display colors are a matter of personal taste and perception so if you don't need calibrated color output, you will probably be quite happy with the color rendition on the Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not happy, Cyanogen OS offers plenty of ways to adjust the screen output. We managed to improve substantially the accuracy of the color rendition by adjusting the color temperature via the LiveDisplay feature from 6500K to 5200K. With this adjustment Avg deltaE went down to 3.8 and the rendition of white became almost perfect. The screen however loses some of its maximum brightness in the process and would only go as high as 383nits with this adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LiveDisplay lets you create two presets for color temperature - one for use during the day and one for night time. You can switch between day/night manually or have the phone do it automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're wondering why, it's medical reports claim looking at blue light in the evening can affect your sleeping cycle. Several studies have confirmed that it reduces melatonin - the hormone responsible for sleep. So you might want to use a warmer light setting (i.e. less blue or smaller temperature reading) at night.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 is a dual-SIM, dual-standby phone that can freely roam the globe. It has basic GSM and CDMA connectivity, along with 3G data (again GSM and CDMA) and two flavors of LTE (international and Chinese).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac is supported as is Bluetooth 4.1, however there's no NFC or ANT+. This precludes easy pairing and certain sports trackers. Positioning is handled by a GPS and GLONASS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired connectivity is the more interesting part. USB 3.1 Type C promises up to 5Gbps transfers, up from around 0.5Gbps for USB 2.0. While microUSB 3.0 did not last on mobile devices, Type C is building up popularity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't look like ZUK has implemented some of the more advanced features of the standard - e.g. DisplayPort TV out and the 100W power delivery spec - but it definitely has the speed. We ran a couple of benchmarks with the Z1 connected to a USB 2.0 port and a USB 3.1 port and copied over a large file from the SSD on one of our office PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We copied the file over several times to the ZUK Z1, first through a USB 2.0 port and then through a USB 3.0 port. The phone didn't max out either standard, but it ran noticeably faster on USB 3.0, especially when copying from the phone to the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: the USB Implementers Forum renamed USB 3.0, which leads to some confusion. What used to be USB 3.0 is now "USB 3.1 Gen 1" while what was supposed to be USB 3.1 is marketed as "USB 3.1 Gen 2." Gen 2 doubles the speed of Gen 1, 10Gbps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 has a huge 4,100mAh Li-Ion battery. It's made up of two rectangular batteries stacked on top of each other to better fill in the curved shape of the back. Note that you don't get any special fast-charging solutions, the included 5V/2A charger is fast but will still take a while to fill up the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably heard that lithium batteries don't like being overcharged - leaving them plugged in when they are at 100% reduces their lifespan. The ZUK Z1 has a hardware solution to the problem, which disconnects the battery from the charger and run the phone on electricity from the charger. Other phones do the opposite - disconnect the charger from the battery, drain the battery a bit, charge it back up, which isn't good for the battery either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a big battery, the big results come as no surprise. Talk time hovers around 25 hours, an excellent result (even if we expected more). In the browser test the Z1 came 15 minute short of 11 hours, again a good result without being the best. It lasted longer when playing videos, over 14 hours, which too falls in the great, but not perfect category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK team partnered with Cyanogen for the software on the international Z1. It's based on CyanogenMod, which itself is fairly close to stock Android. It's not CyanogenMod though, instead it's Cyanogen OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference is mainly that Cyanogen and ZUK added a couple of proprietary apps to the software package. And of course, Cyanogen OS is Google-certified, meaning you get Google Play Services out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Cyanogen has touched has been largely to add extra customization options where the stock software is limited. So it's not exactly Nexus, but it comes with the full Google suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 units sold in China will run ZUI instead, which changes the interface slightly so it's closer to skins popular in the country (e.g. no app drawer like in MIUI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you've been living in a skinned-Android world until now, many things will feel familiar as makers have been course-correcting their skins to be closer to the stock vanilla look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the time and the notifications, a swipe from the top also brings in the notification area. A couple of shortcuts are available in the bottom corners - dialer on the left and camera on the right. You can change those with other apps if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unlock options include a fingerprint reader. Positioned at the Home key, it unlocks the phone quickly just by placing your finger on top of it. You can quickly get used to press the Home key to waking the phone and leaving your finger in place for the fingerprint reader to unlock it. It all takes under a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double-tap to wake is also supported and you can enable the proximity sensor to prevent the phone from unlocking accidentally while it's in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 uses the Trebuchet launcher, which has been skinned to look like the Google Now launcher. There's also the ZUK theme, but you can install many more from the Cyanogen Theme Store if you don't like the defaults.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that some themes even include custom looks for apps, not just the launcher itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The launcher itself features a permanent Google search field on top and a shortcut dock at the bottom. The app drawer is an alphabetized vertical list with an index at the bottom. This isn't as compact as a grid view and there's no option to change it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area shows the notifications after the first pull and the quick toggles after the second. Here the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggles have been given priority, they are bigger than the rest, but you can easily re-arrange them to fit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a brightness slider in here too, though we miss one thing - the Auto brightness toggle. You have to go into the settings for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cyanogen-made additions include a small weather widget and Quick pulldown, basically giving you one-swipe access to the toggles from the left or right corner of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the User switch. By default you get Owner and Guest accounts and you can easily add more of each. Guest accounts can be prevented from making calls, but not from accessing certain apps. Also note that you can switch users from the lockscreen and each account has different security settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So even if you have a fingerprint lock set up, it's easy to jump into the Guest account, which does not need to have a fingerprint assigned to it. Accounts do not share data though, so you can't view photos taken with the Owner account from the Guest account, for example. Still, you might want to set up a more secure lock for the Guest account too. There's no way to automatically switch between users based on their fingerprints though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting back on track, the App switcher shows a 3D rolodex of the running apps and in Google style even keeps the search field. This makes it easy to access even from inside apps - tap the switcher key and type in your query (or say it). Holding down the Home key is faster though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the Cyanogen customizations is that you get extensive control over what each button does. You can add different actions for short, long and double pressing the Home key and short/long pressing the App switcher key. You can customize the Power menu too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to enable an on-screen bar with these buttons (it's customizable too). Normally we wouldn't use them when there are hardware buttons, but we like having piece of mind knowing that even if those break some time down the road, it's easy to switch to their virtual counterparts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chromecast users will be pleased to hear that there's a quick shortcut for screen mirroring in the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While digging into the screen settings, you can also change the screen DPI. A smaller DPI fools the software into thinking the screen is bigger than it actually is, fitting a lot more content on the 5.5" screen. And if your eyesight isn't that great, you can move to a bigger DPI, making all apps look bigger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the ZUK Z1 Lenovo chose the tried and true Snapdragon 801 chipset. Once a flagship chip, it offered great performance with good battery life, though things in the high end have progressed since last year. In Z1's price range, however, it's mostly octa-core processors based on Cortex-A53 and low-power GPUs. Plus, the ZUK has 3GB of RAM, more than most of its competition. Overall, we're quite satisfied with the ZUK Z1 equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the processor - four Krait 400 cores at 2.5GHz should have the lead over Cortex-A53 cores, but as it turns out that's not the case. Basemark OS 2.0 gives it good marks for overall performance - below the OnePlus 2 and Meizu MX5, which have four powerful A57 cores and four A53s - but above the all-A53 crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single and multi-core performance is nothing spectacular though, even for this price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench and AnTuTu 5 are not impressed either, putting the ZUK Z1 at or near the bottom. Krait was a great core in its day, but its time has passed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to graphics, the Adreno 330 should ace the 1080p test, though mid-range chipsets pack GPUs that are a generation ahead of it. That's Adreno 430 (OnePlus 2), Mali-T760 (Lenovo K3 Note), PowerVR G6200 (Xiaomi Redmi Note 2). These GPU names should be familiar if you've looked into the specs of current flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For older games (OpenGL ES 2.0) and newer games (OpenGL ES 3.0) the GPU on the Snapdragon 801 should offer a similar performance to the newer mid-range GPUs. Only the OnePlus 2 showed competitive scores (no surprise, it uses Adreno 330's successor though at the same 1080p resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that OpenGL ES 3.1 is not supported on the Adreno 3xx series.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark X gives the ZUK Z1 fairly high scores, but puts it behind the Adreno 430-powered OnePlus 2 (because this test would account for the difference in screen resolution).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cyanogen Browser is still very new (added in CM12.1) so we decided to use Chrome for the benchmarks instead. Kraken 1.1 shows very good JavaScript performance, ZUK obviously picked a well-tuned engine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>General web browsing, as measured by BrowserMark 2.1, is fairly close to the modern chipsets, beating the Meizu m2 note by quite some distance, losing to the OnePlus 2 by a smaller margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To summarize, the Snapdragon 801 was a decent choice for the ZUK Z1. True, the new mid-range chipsets offer similar performance to this former flagship chipset and they even take the lead in CPU tests with their multiple cores. In the graphics department however the Snapdragon 801 was able to show the whippersnappers a thing or two. It can't play OpenGL ES 3.1 games though, so you'll miss out on the cutting edge gaming tech but that's hardly a thing at the moment. Browsing performance is solid for the class.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 packs two nanoSIMs, both of which can handle 4G LTE networks. Reception and audio quality in calls is solid, while a mic on the back of the phone enables noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For incoming calls, the Reverse lookup option will automatically find info for numbers not in your phonebook. There's also the Truecaller add-on, which also identifies incoming numbers and can block them if they have been classified as spam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main screen of the phone app shows a T9-enabled keypad for smart search. You can pick the flavor of the T9 input - great if your phonebook is in Korean, Greek, Russian, Hebrew or Chinese.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is the call log and the third one shows all your contacts, with ones marked as favorite listed on top with big thumbnails. There's a dedicated Contacts app as well, but it doesn't add much other than a Groups tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 scored a Good mark on our loudspeaker test, putting it in the middle of the affordable 5.5" segment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 comes with a stock-looking SMS and MMS app, but before you switch to Hangouts or another app check out the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under Privacy you'll find settings for WhisperPush, a TextSecure-based system that lets you send out encrypted messages to other WhisperPush users. You'll need to complete a quick registration process before you can enable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also note that encrypted messages are sent over data, support for encrypted SMS messages was dropped a while back. The system will work with any app that handles SMS, however keep in mind that it doesn't encrypt messages sent through other means (e.g. Hangout messages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is available, of course, but you can try the custom app. It's a partnership between Cyanogen and Boxer and prides itself in customizable swipe actions an easy bulk actions (swiping multiple emails at once). You can set emails as To-Do items with due dates and integrate with Evernote, Dropbox, Google Drive and Box for cloud attachment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Boxer email app supports multiple accounts with combined inbox and boasts full Gmail label support, plus its own Smart folders, which figures out how you like to file your emails in different folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, for texting you get the Android Keyboard, which is quite capable. It supports themes and layouts (want QWERTZ? Dvorak? Sure!) and gesture typing (think Swype). Text correction options are available and include features like blocking offensive words and suggesting contact names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dictation is also supported (both online and offline), but there's no mini or floating keyboard options, which are often found on phones with screens this size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app is a Cyanogen effort (GalleryNext). The default view is called Moments, basically grouping photos time and location info to group photos together. Casting is supported out of the box too (note that it's not the same as mirroring the screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple online galleries are supported - Facebook, Google+, Flickr and Dropbox. You'll need to add an account for the service first (only one per service), after you can browse photos by service (e.g. only Facebook photos) or view all photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the app is pretty close to the stock Android gallery, it even uses similar editing tools.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cyanogen also has a custom music player, however, the ZUK Z1 relies only on Google Play Music. The app itself is quite capable, balancing between offline music playback and streaming from Play Music. Caching can preload the music when the phone is hooked up to a charger and a Wi-Fi network to minimize its impact. When on a mobile network, you can choose quality (and thus data size) for non-cached tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google even recently added equalizer support, which has long been a complaint about the app. On the Z1 it's Cyanogen's AudioFX, which comes with several presets and a manual 5-band equalizer. You get different settings for playing through a headset, the speaker and Bluetooth speakers. There are Bass and Virtualizer sliders (those are available for headsets only).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player, you can use the gallery or the file browser to pick a video instead. It's very spartan, giving you only a play/pause button. If you're serious about watching videos on the ZUK Z1 you'd better install a proper video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware itself is pretty capable and didn't snag on any video/audio combo, including 4K HEVC video and multichannel audio (AC3, DTS). So just pick an app with subtitle support and a UI you like and you're all set.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is somewhat quiet, nicely clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 didn't impress us with loudness when connected to an active external amplifier, but its clarity readings were quite good. The stereo crosstalk was slightly above average, but the other readings were excellent, adding up to very good overall quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes some frequency response fluctuation and adds a tiny bit of distortion, but the output is still nicely clear by any standard. Impressively, the stereo crosstalk changes very little and is among the better in this scenario, but the volume levels drop a bit further. All in all a decent showing by the ZUK flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 packs a 13MP camera with optical image stabilization and a dual-LED flash. The camera is built around the popular Sony IMX 214 sensor, 5 plastic lens and Qualcomm's ISP. The OIS module compensates for shaking or rotating thanks to a built-in gyroscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For software, ZUK settled on Cyanogen's in-house solution, namely Camera Next. They UI looks like an imitation of the Google Camera, but it's somewhat rough around the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder is quite streamlined with still, video and buttons on the right and some mode toggles on the bottom. The circle gives you access to exposure compensation, white balance and a couple of extra options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some much needed toggles are a further tap away: HDR, Night, Steady photo are mixed in with color effects and camera modes (e.g. Sunset, Party). This makes it a very long, confusing list. It doesn't help that it's just big white letters with no icons so you have to read each and every one to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is much better organized with standard Android lists and tabs. The General tab has some interesting options like using the Power button as a shutter key, volume rocker as a zoom lever, left-handed mode for those controls and boosting the screen brightness to ensure good visibility outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is fairly good though some imperfections are visible at 100%. The noise reduction leaves noise in, while at the same time there's smeared fine detail. The white balance is okay (a touch cool) and colors are slightly under-saturated. Also, purple fringing is quite noticeable in reflections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does keep plenty of detail and the dynamic range is quite good and the camera finds a good balance between preserving highlights and resolving shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IMX 214 sensor does have its limits though, so you can toggle the HDR mode to help (we just wish it wasn't buried so deep in the options). This mode works quite well, it brings in more detail in the bright areas without ghosting. In some cases it reduces the contrast more than we would have liked though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode is quite disappointing though, the images come out with between 400px and 600px vertical resolution, which is tiny. There's very little detail in the shots, even if the stitching is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie camera is an 8MP shooter, clearly the ZUK Z1 goes after the selfie-minded. It captures plenty of detail and nearby subjects look great. You can see some noise in the soft, faraway background but it's not a huge issue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera: use a third-party camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We tried recording some test videos with the ZUK Z1 stock camera app and we ran into a problem. The 1080p videos were recorded at 27fps, so they are noticeably choppy. The camera offers different codecs - H.264 (27fps), H.263 (refused to record 1080p) and MPEG-4 (26.9fps) so there isn't an option for a smooth 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 801 (even S800) is fully capable of capturing 4K video so 1080p should have been a breeze. We installed the latest firmware version available and that did not help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded at 20Mbps, which is a good start, while audio is captured in stereo at 96Kbps, 48kHz, which is not a lot. Unfortunately, even at this bitrate the videos look heavily compressed, which obscures some of the detail captured by the sensor, and you can see banding in gradients too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality isn't the best 1080p we've seen, but it's still good. Sound is good, despite the low bitrate. The autofocus was too eager though and moving objects caused it to hunt for focus all too often. And that's with it set on Auto focus instead of Continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ironically, ZUK Z1's 60fps high-speed mode practically nailed 60fps. The other option is recording at 60fps and playing back at 30fps for a slow-motion effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But back to the 1080p@60fps video. It eats up double the storage of 30fps, it has a narrower field of view and a noticeable drop in resolved detail even further so use that with caution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So instead, we installed the free Google Camera app and had a second go with it at video recording,. You can imagine how surprised we were to see it recorded a 1080p video at 30fps without a hitch. The video and audio bitrate remained the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a YouTube playlist that will allow you to compare the video quality of the clips captured with the two camera apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here are the standard charts we shoot for the Video Quality Comparison tool. Note that we shot them with the Google Camera just to be sure.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 comes with the new Cyanogen browser (the shortcut just names it as "Browser"). It promises to be both faster and more memory efficient than Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The Cyanogen-made browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Browser is based on the stock Android browser and doesn't look much differently. An easily accessible New private tab button hints at a focus on privacy. You can save pages for offline viewing, but some contemporary features are missing, e.g. bookmark syncing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to use Chrome instead - it will sync bookmarks and open tabs across devices signed into the same Google account. You can sync form fill data and even passwords if you like. You can use Google's page compression to speed up load times on slow networks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 comes with a fairly slim preinstalled app package - not minimal, but certainly not bloated. You get just enough to get you going out of the gate, the rest of the storage is open for the apps of your choice. Anyway, there's a mix of Android apps, Cyanogen apps and some third-party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app continues Cyanogen's collaboration with Boxer. The app supports Gmail and Exchange calendars (it uses Android's native sync), it has some beautiful Material design and offers day, week and agenda views. Calendar can use the Boxer Email app to send availability notifications to people attending a certain meeting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app is the Google-made one. It offers the standard functions - alarms, world time, timer and chronometer. Flipping or angrily shacking the phone can be set to snooze or dismiss alarms, but it may be better to set your favorite playlist as the alarm tone and ease out of bed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File manager is courtesy of Cyanogen. You can enable a swipe gesture (deleting files or folders). Another option is to create password protected storage in the internal memory. The app can be a little confusing, for example copying a file looks like this: select file, move to the destination folder, hit the menu button and choose "Copy selection here." The copy/paste semantics you're used to from your computer simply don't apply here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screencast speaks for itself - it records your phone's screen (with white dots indicating finger touches). Here's a quick sample session with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Facebook app and Google Drive pre-installed for basic social networking and cloud storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUI version in China gets a slightly different app package, which includes popular services like WeChat and Beidou Maps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZUK Z1 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The beautifully machined metal chassis is hidden inside, while the glossy plastic on the outside does not look great in person</paragraph>
			<paragraph>64GB base storage is enough, especially with the slim software package, so we can live without a microSD slot;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is great, though we've seen it done with fewer milliamps;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is very good for the class, with very accurate colors after an easy white balance correction, but the blacks don't look as deep as we would have liked;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cyanogen OS brings some cool customization options to the mostly stock Android, but we ended up gravitating towards the Google ecosystem;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software package is minimal, but functional; you'll probably end up replacing many of the pre-installed apps anyway</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader is fast to operate and a nice addition;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is great for games, and comparatively okay for general usage;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera hardware is good, the selfie camera especially, but you need a third-party camera app to get the best out of the main snapper (even basic stuff like getting 30fps at 1080p); The panorama mode is downright disappointing;</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 is supposed to be an "out of the box" device, at least outside of Lenovo's usual box. Lenovo will soon move its mobile division under the storied Motorola brand for better name recognition in the West, while backing the ZUK startup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z1 doesn't live up to the outsider status, phones with 5.5" 1080p screens and a mid-range price are the most popular category these days. Its two advanced features - fingerprint reader and optical image stabilization - are rare, but can still be found in similar devices. The 8MP selfie camera is great, but not unique either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZUK put together some very good quality hardware. The screen (with a bit of tuning) is very accurate color-wise, bright enough too, the metal frame is sturdy, the chipset does great for gaming and the camera hardware is solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the phone is somewhat let down by the software. The software package feels superficially familiar, but that's because many apps are based on AOSP code. The Cyanogen-customized apps were often disappointing, the camera is the easiest example - it fails at 1080p@30fps, while Google Camera does it easily. The video player software does not do the hardware justice either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another issue, the software updates, but it's not what you think. They are too common. Yes, it's great that any issues are fixed quickly (e.g. Stagefright is already patched) and that new features arrive quick, but we quickly got tired of waiting for the "Android is upgrading..." screen to complete. It just feels like we've flashed an unofficial Nightly CyanogenMod ROM on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the ZUK Z1, the Motorola Moto X Play is at an arm's length from the Lenovo parent. It has a 5.5" 1080p screen in a more compact but thicker body and a 21MP main camera. It doesn't do 2160p video like the Moto X Style and no OIS either. Plus, the selfie camera is a 5MP shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is weaker, mainly the GPU, and it has 2GB of RAM. The storage is expandable, though not as much as the ZUK out of the box. Motorola's commitment to updates has been called into question recently, after it cut support for the eight-month old Moto E 2nd gen. With Cyanogen hard at work on their Android AOSP fork and with constant updates flying in every other day, the ZUK Z1 is much more likely to stay on top of the latest Android has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus 2 has a fingerprint reader like the ZUK Z1 and unlike the Moto X Play. It too has a 5.5" 1080p screen, but this one ups its game with a newer Snapdragon 810 chipset (downclocked). The camera department boasts a 13MP camera with OIS on the back, 5MP on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just keep in mind that the base OnePlus 2 model has only 16GB of storage (non-expandable, 3GB RAM). A better comparison (but pricier) is the 64GB version with 4GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX5 switches things around with an all-metal body and an AMOLED display. It's still 5.5" big with 1080p resolution though. It has a fingerprint sensor and a 20.7MP camera with a large sensor (1/2.3") and 2160p video capture and laser autofocus (no OIS though). The selfie camera is 5MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaTek chipset boasts a good GPU by PowerVR and the non-expandable storage goes up to 64GB (with 16GB and 32GB versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 is a popular 5.5" 1080p phone too. It uses the same MediaTek chipset as the MX5, and has a microSD slot. The 13MP camera lacks OIS, but has hybrid phase detection autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi Note 2 is quite affordable, though it comes with some compromises like a sub-par battery life, only 2GB of RAM, no NFC and only 720p video from the 5MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's one from the Lenovo mothership too, the K3 Note. It has a MediaTek chipset with a different GPU, a Mali that's able to hold its own against the aging Adreno 330. Like the Xiaomi, this one has 2GB of RAM and expandable built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're okay with a 2014 device, the LG G3 is in this price range too. Its 5.5" screen has QHD resolution - it's sharp and bright, though the contrast was disappointing. It does have a 13MP camera with 2160p video and OIS. No fingerprint reader though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is essentially the same, Snapdragon 801, especially if you get the 3GB/32GB version (there's a 2GB/16GB version as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end the ZUK Z1 feels like a great product in the making, but it's not ready for prime time. It's affordable, but not cheap, so you'll be disappointed each time the software messes up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd say that with constant updates it will eventually be polished to perfection, but there are quite a few stories of a device starting off with Cyanogen OS and moving away from it. OnePlus is a prime example, the partnership with Yu looked shaky for a moment (but is reportedly steady now).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware on the Z1 is really quite good - the screen, fingerprint reader, the chipset all pleased us with their performance. The ZUK Z1 has teething pains that hurt its eligibility in the face of so many options (from makers that are now past such growing pains) so much so that we're already looking out for the ZUK Z2, hopefully in the making.</paragraph>
