			<paragraph>The second Nokia flip phone got new untraditional look. It has stylish steel covers and by first reactions it's a success. Nokia, after years, finally produced a clamshell with large display and doesn't resist the new technologies - 6170 model features Push-to-talk, HSCSD and EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia kicked against the clamshells for a very long time but couldn't resist the growing trend forever and nowadays we know already five clamshell phones from the Finnish company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 7200 model was a really untraditional phone with textile covers. It's a standard Series 40 mobile and is on the market for several months. Nokia claims that it's a successful one and I, personally, know that women (which are the main target group) like the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 7200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This review concerns another clamshell in the list, the 6170 model, which was introduced in June. Nokia used larger display, new graphical environment and also a lot of new options and functions. The phone is stylish but also quite conservative; main design feature are the steel covers. Estimated price is lower than the price of Nokia 7200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6170</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third flip phone from the same family is the September newcomer Nokia 7270. It derives from the same concept as the 6170, but adds a bit more of extravagance and some new functions - for example a radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 7270</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tested Nokia 6170 will be in distribution approximately in November. Nokia announced that the price would be about 250 EUR. Because there is still some time remaining to the distribution start, it is clear that we don't have a final product available yet. But it works perfect, except a few details, so we don't hesitate to publish this article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>European clamshell<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've got a new definition in the dictionary: European clamshell. We can look at Nokia, Motorola or Siemens phones with different attitude than at Asian producers. European clamshell phones are not so showily attractive, producers prefer to play with design, they experiment and they're not afraid to use unusual concepts and elements; in short, they are not using one and the same style which has possibly become kind of boring already. I personally like this kind of attitude. On the other hand, the success of some Asian products in Europe proves that they have also found a place on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   This is not an Asian clamshell</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6170 is a very nice phone. OK, no generalization - it's a nice phone in my opinion and according to the reactions of my friends. Designers bet on pure design, which is not disturbed by any ornaments. The phone features block form with slightly rounded edges; front and rear parts are absolutely flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Design is very modest, maybe boring for some people</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may seem that the material covering the surface looks like steel; that's right. Covers are really made of steel, they can't be changed and they're decorated with small, probably etched, dots. With your eye close to the phone you can see that the dots size is decreasing towards the edges - a cute detail. Discreet sign Nokia is incised on the front cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dots are decorating the steel cover ? Nokia logo is almost invisible </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No creaks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By comparing sizes of Nokia 6170 we find out that it's a midsized phone (88 x 46 x 22 mm). It's also pretty heavy, 121 grams is nowadays weight above the average. It won't tear away your pocket, of course, and also it's not bad sometimes to feel that you hold something in your hand. Higher weight brings one more advantage: even that it's a very long flip phone with a thick display; it won't lose balance when you open it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Even that it's a long and thick clamshell, it won't lose balance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the 7200 clamshell, Nokia has significantly improved the construction. Whilst previous phone creaked just by looking bad at it, the new 6170 is very solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four dots in the left bottom corner of the front surface are covering the loud speaker. The phone uses it for ringing and for a loud handsfree as well. Unfortunately, this model features no radio. The lens of the integrated camera is placed a bit asymmetrically which doesn't look good to me. If it was situated a bit higher and a bit more to the right, it would perfectly fit to the rectangular composition, respecting all other elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera lens</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Secondary display with a color animated wallpaper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Small front display size is 26 x 20 mm. It is a color one, displays 4K color shades, it uses however a passive technology, so its quality is not as good as e.g. of the main (inner) display. It shows standard information about calls and messages and by pressing the switch button a list of ringing profiles appears. Ringing profiles can be changed fast, without opening the phone, but that's all from the interactive features of the mini display. Further functions are only informative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll find a separate menu used for customizing the mini display in the phone. You can set wallpaper there, possibly an animated GIF (the animation switched off after a while but this can be a characteristic of the tested piece only). After some time a saver appears, it can also be a picture or an animation. If you wait longer, it shows a digital clock. Also it's possible to set colors to the battery symbol and a signal strength indicator. It can't be set on white color, so the image is almost invisible with dark wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main/mini display graphics settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has no diode to indicate missed calls or incoming messages. This information is shown on the display only. You can see it even after the illumination switches off - it stays as the text for a while, later it turns into an icon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What's the golden contact for?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone there are two buttons for volume control and voice dialing. On the right there is a switch button and push to talk service activation button. The infrared port is hidden between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Buttons on the left and on the right side (an infrared port inbetween)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is using a normal Li-Ion BL-4C battery with capacity of 760 mAh. Producer claims that it should last for up to 270 hours on standby, eventually 240 minutes of speech. I found one interesting thing after removing the back cover: a golden contact in the upper part, which is touching the metal sheet of the cover. I have only one idea what is the purpose of the golden contact is - it's the "extension" of the antenna, which can't otherwise touch the metal cover. Update 24 Jan 2005 - The purpose of this part is to ensure a tight fit of battery cover towards the lower block cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  After you click on the picture, take notice of the golden spike in the upper part of the phone ? frame of the cover is plastic, but covered by a metal label ? there is a visible strap slot in the corner</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An eye for a wrist strap is partially hidden under the cover; we can only see a hole in the upper part, right beside the solid hinge. The hinge looks to be made of plastic but there could be a metal axis inside. To increase solidity of the construction the hinge is divided in five parts. Both side positions are secured by a spring; the user has to overcome the power of the spring if he would like to open the phone. With some effort it's possible to open the phone just by one hand but it's more comfortable by using both hands. Pop-Port connector is placed in the bottom part and we can find the charger slot right beside it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A really large display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for outer metal labels Nokia has chosen semi matte appearance, inner metalized surfaces are shiny; therefore fingerprints remain on them. It's concerning the filling around the display and around the keypad - silver plastic decorated with small black dots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Inner surfaces of the phone are plastic; but again decorated with dots</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Nokia clamshell phone, 7200, was criticize for its small display - and fair - for a square with resolution of 128 x 128 is really not enough for this kind of phone. The new Nokia 6170 is featuring a bigger display, which we've seen for the first time (and for the last time so far) with the eccentric 7600 3G phone. The display size is 31 x 39 mm, it's active and with resolution of 128 x 160 pixels it displays 65K colors. Although there are phones with bigger and finer displays, we can't reproach Nokia; its display is of high quality now. Just to get it in a model with Nokia 6230 style...</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new display comes with an innovated graphical interface. It derives from new Series 40 models but it can furnish more information arranged in a different way. In the main menu you can choose between icons matrix style and a text list with pictures (four items per page). Next menu levels are in text form only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu in a list and matrix form ? text form in the next level</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with mini display, you can also choose a color wallpaper (can be animated), screensaver and time lag also for the main display. It's also possible to change the environment color. But similarly as with i.e. Nokia 6230 it's not suitable to use too dark pictures otherwise you won't see the text on the display. When receiving incoming calls the background gets much lighter and the number or the name of the caller is well visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Various color wallpapers ? font remains the same and unfortunately it's not visible on dark pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An innovation I haven't seen with previous Nokia models is the support of graphical themes. It's a package (file with NTH extension), in which wallpaper for mini and main displays and ringing tone are packed. All these details can be applied at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> NTH files with the graphical themes ? packages content </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Strictly rectangular keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6170 keypad is of rectangle form and all numeric keys have the same size. They are really large, each of them has size of 11 x 9 mm, but they are placed without marked borders to help better orientation. I would appreciate more noticeable feeling by pressing. Anyway, the keys are very accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad is nearly flat</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functional part of the keypad follows the typical order: four-directional button with a confirmation key in the middle, keys with green and red phone, two function keys. Keys with phone and the function keys are put together on a common double key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main control button ? the keys are really large</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Functions are assigned to all four directions of the control button with no possibility to change them. Address book, messages editor and camera are functions that we already know but Push to talk groups on the right arrow are something new - with some previous models it was the calendar. It's possible to assign one of twelve functions to the right function key under the display, the left one runs Go to user menu and you can choose from thirty-seven functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are distinctly illuminated in blue. Illumination of keypad edges looks also very attractive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We will have to wait for a megapixel camera in a normal Nokia mobile phone. The resolution with the tested model is still only 640 x 480 pixels. Nevertheless it brings one new feature: 4x digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Digital zoom in action: nothing special</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For shooting you can choose between two resolutions (lower resolution is meant for the pictures attached to the address book) and select one of three quality levels. Night mode and self timer are available but still there is no possibility of exposure compensation. The mini display can be used also as a finder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Night street in a standard and a night mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality is average, comparable to the most of the VGA camera phones. Pictures are fuzzy on the edges and unwanted light effect appears sometimes due to the cover glass of the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sample pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows video record. Resolution is still very low, only 128 x 96, video length depends on the free memory. A useful feature: it's possible to abort recording and to continue later - you can get more scenes to one 3GP file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Download a video sample</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures, video and other multimedia files are stored in the Gallery. You can choose from three different views, you can zoom in a picture or run a slide show. I miss the possibility for full-display view without the stripes around. You can "play" with your photos a bit - add a text, a clip art, a frame or crop them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Three types of Gallery view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the memory is a bit strange. The phone shows about 2.2 MB, but I doubt this will be the case with the final product, because Nokia is not saving memory space with its last phones. There was information about 11 megabytes on the Internet?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Don't take this information very seriously</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Perfect telephony functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6170 functions are the same as with other Series 40 phones. Only the graphical interface has changed, because of the bigger display. Further features are almost the same, so I won't analyze them in details again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Telephony sound is average; Nokia phones are not on the top from this point of view. I can praise loudness of the earphone and the integrated handsfree. It's possible to record a call, but it's not enough just to press a button - the respective option must be selected from the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Entering a number ? dialing ? incoming call</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With clamshell phones it is always a question what to do with a call when the phone is in closed position. By pressing the side buttons Nokia switches off ringing, by opening the phone and fast pressing the red button you'll reject a call and if you don't do it fast, you will hear the caller in the earphone in a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address book in the phone can handle 500 names. Each name may contain up to five numbers (you can choose from five types) as well as further text information such as push to talk address, e-mail, web page, postal address, chat nickname (WV) and a text note. Names can be sorted in groups and this way only you can assign them different ringing tones. You can also add a picture to a contact, which appears on the mini and main display with an incoming call. Nokia traditionally supports My Presence Service which makes it possible to find out whether the opposite side is available for a call. However that can't be used without operator's support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Types of numbers that can be saved ? text information menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll enter the address book by pressing the down arrow; searching goes very fast with gradual writing of characters. Pressing the green earphone button starts dialing a number and this function is set as default; the middle confirmation button brings you to details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Four different views on the address book ? name detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polyphony with 40 chords celebrates a premiere with Nokia phones - in usual phones at least. And I have to acknowledge that the quality improvement is noticeable. Moreover, Nokia rewrote the old hits to use the potential of the higher polyphony. Besides the ringing in MID files it's also possible to use AAC sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Ringing profiles menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After 5140, Nokia 6170 is the next phone supporting Push-to-talk service; operator's support is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Push to talk menu </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages: complete offer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text and multimedia messages editors are the same as before. For SMS writing you can set the font in two sizes, the phone counts down written characters and you can see right on the display in how many parts the message will be split. The MMS editor inserts pictures to text only as links; you can see the result in a final view only. You can attach more pages; data limit per one MMS is 100 kB.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It would be a mistake if I skip the email browser as not interesting at all, because all data profiles and service settings have changed. There is just one Configuration menu where you can set Wap, MMS, synchronization, Push to talk, My Presence and IM, email and stream media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Menu for setting up everything </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting is not quite simple so we'll get back to that when the phone is in sale. We can expect that people will use more the automatic setting by means of configuration SMS. If you don't go deep in the menu and you want i.e. just to select a data profile, the phone says that it's the provider who should have sent you the setting. It's also possible to set everything manually but it's quite difficult sometimes. Email client seems to be faster than with older Nokia phones but its functionality is the same. It's a Java application, which can use the internal address book of the phone but it doesn't recognize the attachments at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Basic menu of the email browser ? writing a new message </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organization: nothing new<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alarm clock with the new Nokia is repeated after all. You can even set week days when it should be active and also the sound you would like to hear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Alarm clock settings ? days in week selection </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I've described the Calendar in Series 40 mobiles many times? Again, it shows month, week and day view with several types of events, repetition, reminder etc. To-do list will manage your tasks; after accomplishment can be ticked off. For writing longer texts you can use Notes (max. 3000 chars) and a voice recorder will record up to 3 minutes of your voice notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Month, week and day view in the Calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Various types of events in the Calendar ? a text note ? voice recorder </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be possible to synchronize data in Nokia 6170 with PC. Up to now we don't have software available so I wasn't able to try the function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, stopwatch, countdown timer? it makes no sense to analyze these functions. Quite interesting is the Wallet for storing passwords, codes and other secret information that shouldn't be seen by everybody who holds the phone in his hand. At first start-up you'll choose a password and without it nobody has a chance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Entertainment and data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports Java (MIDP 2.0). I found two games and two applications in the memory. Puzzle is a quite playable variant of Tetris; Beach Race is a car racing. Translator can translate some basic words between English, Spanish, French, German and Italian languages. World Clock II is an application used for time zone orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Java games folder ? Puzzle ? Beach Race</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wap browser features Last web address service which gets you to the last entered address. This function wasn't available in former Nokia models and even the full history would be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Three font sizes in the Wap browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides playing recorded video, which is saved in the memory, Nokia supports also stream media (RTSP protocol). I didn't really succeed with trying this function because except several videos on Nokia wap I wasn't able to find a service that could work with the phone. Nokia 6170 is unfortunately short of radio and is not compatible with MP3 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6170 offers wide range of mobile data technologies. Besides slow dial connection (CSD) and HSCSD it "knows" also GPRS class 10 and EDGE with theoretical speed 238.6 kb/s maximum. Connecting the phone with a PC is possible via data cable or infrared port, Nokia 6170 doesn't have Bluetooth for fast connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Possible mass clamshell<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Don't turn your back to Nokia 6170 just because it's not your favorite brand of phone. It's a very well equipped phone for a price, which I can imagine to be much higher. I must acknowledge the design again (even that it's clear that it won't please everybody), solid construction, large display and a good array of functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6170 is an excellent mobile phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a pity that the 6170 doesn't support Bluetooth. Radio would be useful as well and if Nokia would add a memory card, an MP3 player would be also very nice. But not every mobile can be equipped as the highest model 6230. There's a place on the market also for cheaper and functionally limited phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competitors? For fashion conscious users Nokia will introduce the 7270 model that will offer the same functions in a different package. Still we have the older Nokia 7200, but new phones are more attractive so decreasing the price should help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the other brands, mainly Samsung phones, e.g. E800 and E700, would be competitors, and from the functions point of view Siemens SL65 is on similar level. Motorola comes to the fight with its V600 and V80 models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Nokia 7200 was a phone designated mainly for female users, who have enough money, the new Nokia 6170 would be more ambitious. It will be cheaper even at the beginning of the sale. It's not so extremely eccentric and its functions will surpass the demands of the most people.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pros and Cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>+ design + solid construction + quality and large display  - shiny surfaces will easily get dirty - higher weight - unusually low memory</paragraph>
