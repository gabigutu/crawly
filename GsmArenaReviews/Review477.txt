			<paragraph>Samsung managed to introduce perhaps its most attractive model of this year before Christmas. Samsung E630 is an elegant sliding phone with decent choice of the most important functions. And important is that it's not silver again!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Key drawbacks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one model stood out from the offer of Samsung mobile phones until now: E700. That is because it was different from all the others - by the color, construction; also, it came as the first with OLED display type. All other phones returned back to the earlier conception of silver clamshells and even though Samsung introduced interesting sliding construction at models D410 and E800, it was still the original Samsung. Another change, even smaller, is coming up now at the E630 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung E630 is already in distribution. It is oriented to the stylish users and to the people who do not need a hi-tech phone with plenty functions to be happy. It is typical Samsung - I was surprised how had little changed in one year - the time when I have tested a Samsung phone for the last time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are interested in functions, hold on for some time. Samsung is already selling in some countries the most equipped model Samsung D500. Its design is very similar but it features a megapixel camera, MP3 support, better display, more memory and also a Bluetooth for the first time. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plastic to plastic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E630 reminded me of the older E700 immediately. That is because it looks different from the others; main color is not "Korean silver", overall it is a dark phone. Black shiny and matte surfaces are shifting with dark silver. It is very elegant mobile phone, by my opinion one of the most beautiful from Samsung models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone size is 85 x 42 x 22 mm, ranking it among the very small mobile phones as well as in weight point of view measuring only 79 g. The phone looks like an elongated egg; it is a block with rounded corners and edges. Plastic parts seem to be of a good quality and the phone do not creak at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe older Samsung models with a sliding construction spoiled me: I was shocked by a sound that the E630 made when I wanted to open the phone. New model is not equipped with a mechanism for easy opening that enables display to glide silently on the slide bars. At the Samsung E630 there are ordinary grooves where plastics are rubbing together, the display is not going up by itself after a slight touch, you have to guide it all the way up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> No slide bars but plastic in a plastic groove</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction itself is quite solid. In the open position, the display is secured enough, but during opening, the catch is very weak. I dare to estimate that the phone gets opened sometimes even if you do not want that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One display is enough for a phone of a sliding construction. A shiny label going behind the edges of the front surface protects it. Shiny black design has as usually one drawback: you can see every single fingerprint on it; it becomes dirty very easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Shiny display gets easily dirty ? display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display sizes are nowadays rather average (25 x 31 mm), as well as the resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. Samsung cannot surprise us neither with TFT type display with 65 thousand colors. Nevertheless, the display is very quality; you can add a color or animated wallpaper on the desktop. Moreover, it is possible for example to turn off the operator logo, so it does not occupy a picture's place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main display: it is possible to set the position of operator logo or turn it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After experience with Samsung E700, I really appreciate that there is permanently something visible on the display. Illumination turns off after some time and a screen saver turns on, but clock, date, missed calls or messages remain visible. It would be great if the Samsung would warn of a missed event also by a blinking diode, but we have to do without it for this time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Back to the old control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In closed position, we can see only a block of the function keys on the front side. After we close the phone, it automatically activates the keypad lock. When you deactivate it, you can access all the functions that do not require handling the numeric keys. In addition, it is possible to make calls like this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Function keys positioning is not surprising. Besides two keys, controlling actual functions displayed on the bottom row of the display, you can find green and red "earphone" keys, correction key and four-way control key. Although Samsung at the E300 model proved that they could make a phone, where the middle button is used for confirmation, at the new model it runs the WAP browser only. Handling with the main button (especially moving to its four ways) is not comfortable; edges are too embedded in the surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Block of the function keys is accessible even if the phone is closed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each one of four ways has assigned a function that cannot be changed: messages, voice recorder, ringing tone settings and camera. The camera has also a separate button on the right side. To access the address book you have to press two keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the side camera button there is a connector hidden under a sliding cover; the connector appears to be a USB. However, it is not a USB; it is a new port for handsfree connection that is used by Samsung at its recent models. On the opposite side we can find a volume rock switch button, an infrared port below that and in the bottom part there is a system connector that is used for charger or connecting the phone to a PC via cable. The connector is protected with a small removable plug, easy to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sliding cover protects the handsfree connector ? volume control button and an infrared port ? protected system connector</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the corner, there is an eyelet for a wrist strap, the camera lens, a mirror and a lighting diode on the back. A Li-Ion battery is a part of the back cover, with capacity 800 mAh and the producer claims that it should last up to 240 hours in standby mode or 360 minutes of speech. Antenna is integrated; Samsung handles the frequency bands 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz (note: the American frequency band must be activated in the phone menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Wrist strap eyelet in the corner ? lens and other supplements of the integrated camera ? look under the battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numeric keypad appears after you slide the display up. Keys remind me the E700 model very much - they are exceptionally big and if the phone would not be so small and narrow, I would not write a bad word about the control. Key "5" is not distinguished from the other keys by a sharp protrusion as usually but the key is sinuate on both sides. Personally, I am happy with that solution, but I do not know whether people with an optic handicap will appreciate that - it cannot be found by touch. Legends on black keys are white and illuminated enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sound Mate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You will get with the phone neither a nice personal handsfree with a neck strap nor a second battery but you will find a strange black pyramid with an eyelet in the box. Do not try to burn it; it is not a dynamite, but additional loud handsfree. By pressing a safety catch, the pyramid splits in two parts and you will get a piece that you can insert to the "USB" on the side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Perhaps you would not guess what this thing is used for</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is this a useless accessory? Perhaps it is so, especially if the phone offers a built-in handsfree. With the Sound Mate, the sound is louder and richer; also, it amplifies a ringing tone; but who would wear thing like this and keeps it in mind all the time. Thanks to the eyelet, the pyramid can be attached to a hanger or a strap but anyway, it is an extra useless thing. It would be usable if the pyramid would contain better external microphone. Nevertheless, Samsung is using the internal microphone of the phone all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Pyramid attached to the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound of the phone is overall very good - loud, with bass grounds, you will not hear any rustling during a call. In the context menu, there is also a possibility to enhance the sound quality, but I did not notice a difference. I recommend turning off the "Connection tone", so the phone will not whistle in your ear during a dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is necessary to mention how the phones with unusual construction work do during telephony. With Samsung E630 you can choose whether you answer a call directly by sliding the display up or whether by closing the phone it switches to a standby mode and locks the keypad. You can mute an incoming call by holding a side button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: waiting for a megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Integrated camera features only resolution of 640 x 480 pixels; no megapixel in this model. Pictures are just average, fuzzier on the edges than in the center - nothing to celebrate. The camera lens is placed quite inconveniently, the finger touches it automatically when you shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera environment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is good from a functional point of view, it offers several modes of resolution and quality selections, you will find there a night mode and a sequential shooting. With the keys, you can manually set the exposure compensation and use a 4x digital zoom. Next, there is a range of effects and a self-timer, for darker scenes, it is possible to use a lighting diode. Again, there is no way to record a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera possibilities</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera display is height oriented, camera chip is width oriented. What to do with that? Samsung could use only a part of the display for a finder - they decided for the second, by my opinion the worse, possibility. Only the center part of a picture is visible on the display and only after the shooting you can see what is on its edges. It is unpleasant if you want to play more with the picture composition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Pictures folders ? pictures gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can send the pictures from the phone directly via MMS (max. 95 kB); if you want to send them to a PC, you have to install an EasyStudio program first. The infrared port still cannot send the pictures directly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sample pictures taken by Samsung E630<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here you can well see a difference between what you see on the display and a real picture. On the display, a testing diagram bordered left and right edges:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Close-up pictures are not bad:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Scene in dusk: standard settings ? with a lighting diode ? night mode ? night mode with a lighting diode:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are quite fuzzy:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure compensation possibilities:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to a bad lens placement, you can make a picture of your own finger quite often:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>20 megabytes of memory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung continuously slightly innovates the graphical environment of its mobile phones, but the basis is still the same. We have already seen the matrix-type main menu at the E800 model, but icons looks a bit gray at this time. Striking colored is only an active selected picture. Next menu levels are text only; it is possible to use numeric shortcuts to the last branch of the menu tree. Basic menu color can be selected from four variants.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main menu is quite flat ? next levels are text, rectangle shows actualsetting ? address book has its own menu, reminding the older Samsung phones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is easy to get used to the Samsung control; some operations are slower than at other phones - an example is the already mentioned access to the address book. Samsung E630 cannot do voice dialing or voice control but it is possible to assign speed dials to keys 2-9 for chosen phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Color variants of the menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung phones usually do not spare on the memory. E630 model has 20,5 MB of memory - "only" 3 MB of that are assigned to Java.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We are describing still the same functions, aren't we?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is time for functions description and it seems to me like I am writing up a year old Samsung phone. We can find only small changes here. The address book can accommodate up to 1000 names; you can assign five numbers, an email address and note to each one of them. Each name can be assigned to a particular group, add a ringing tone to it and also a picture that appears on the display by an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Searching in the address book ? name's details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Forget names' filtering - Samsung do not respect ringing profiles. Holding a "#" key allows you to turn off the sound fast and activate vibrations. The vibrations can be used also by a normal ringing but they cannot work together with a melody. The phone rings up using 64-tone polyphony, and the integrated melodies are quite boring. It is possible to send new ones from the operator web site or from the EasyStudio program installed on your PC. For messages, you have to select among ten sounds that cannot be changed. If you are not content with one warning of an incoming SMS or MMS, you can choose repeated warning, meaning that the phone will continuously ring until you open the message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standard ringing tones ? special sound can be set also for opening and closing the cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An innovation is a ringing tones composer. You can work with it in two staves and create a multi-voices ringing. For each stave, a different instrument can be selected and you can tinge the result by a musical accompaniment in a chosen style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Ringing tones composer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung still does not offer a full synchronization of the address book and other data with a PC. You can backup and restore items using the EasyStudio application, which can be downloaded for free from the Internet, but that is not the synchronization.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messages writing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am sure that many people would appreciate turning off permanently a T9 dictionary but in fact, it is necessary to deactivate it manually every time when you start writing a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Writing a message ? setting a diacritics</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Working with messages is otherwise comfortable, also thanks to the quality keypad. During SMS writing, the phone counts down written characters and show the user how many parts the text will be split up. Internal memory can hold up to 200 SMS and the same amount of multimedia messages too. MMS editor is well arranged; besides the text, it can manage also a picture and sound. Why there is no e-mail browser available? After all, we know that Samsung implemented it already in the D410 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> MMS editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice recorder for 6 hours<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am going to start the organizer section untraditionally with the voice recorder. It uses whole memory capacity of the E630 and so it is possible to record up to 6-hour long records. Voice recorder is also accessible, even in closed phone position; you will get to the context menu by pressing the down arrow key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Organizer functions selection ? voice recorder (note the record length)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the other organizer applications, I do not see any change. Samsung offers three types of repeated alarm clocks, you can choose days when they will give an alarm. Active alarm can turn the phone on if it is turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alarm clock setting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar is the same; in a month view, week starts by Sunday and days' abbreviations are corresponding the English names. Calendar also displays tasks from to-do list, meetings, birthdays and reminders. It is possible to assign a reminder to every item but Samsung cannot do repeated events - neither at the birthdays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Month view on the calendar ? one item in the calendar ? to-do list ? task detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, you will find a countdown timer, a stopwatch and a calculator in the menu. The calculator handles priorities of the mathematical operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Countdown timer ? stopwatch ? calculator ? units converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast Java and GPRS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Your entire neighborhood will know immediately that you entered the menu of java games and applications in the phone. That is because E630 will play several seconds long jolly melody (why?!). You will find two games in the phone as a standard: Snowball fight and Bubble smile game that is similar to Tetris. In Java, by the way, it is possible to use the middle button for confirmation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Two integrated games ? status of a memory for Java applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung supports MIDP 1.0.3 and in jBenchmark 1.0 scored 792 points. Comparing by this criterion the E630 stands among the fastest Samsung models but overall it is just an average result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Integrated Wap browser uses GPRS class 10; it is also possible to connect to the Internet from the PC using the phone as a modem. Part of the EasyStudio pack is also an application used for easy setting of the data connection. You can connect the phone with a PC using the infrared port or a cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Wap browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E630 have not surprised in any way. Generally, it is the same phone as all other Samsung phones of this class. However, it is not reaching some other rival brands from the functions point of view and still several identical mistakes remain, the producer is interested the most whether his products are attracting the consumers. Moreover, that is obviously not Samsung's problem: Samsung worldwide surpassed Motorola in the third quarter and stands on the second position behind Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung E630 is a mobile phone for common users who need mainly call and work with messages. The phone handles these functions very well and I would emphasize for example exceptionally quality sound. This phone is not suitable for the users who are interested in organizer functions; the other drawback is the half-working infrared port, which cannot directly send pictures. Samsung spared on the sliding mechanism, we have to resign to that fact, but I still cannot get used to the embedded main button. For example, the selection of icons in the main menu was very inconvenient and I was rather using the numeric keypad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of Samsung E630 is more than acceptable. For its price, the user gets a really nice phone.</paragraph>
