			<paragraph>Nokia has prepared a new clamshell for the fans of the stylish phones. The phone features a TFT display and an exceptionally comfortable keypad. It plays MP3 files as well. Yet, the number of minuses is somewhat high: Nokia 6060 does not have an external display, its antenna sticks out and the polyphonic sound is low-quality. There is however one thing that this phone does not lack for sure - it literally exudes charisma.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In June this year Nokia launched four new GSM mobile phones at once. Among them was the clamshell we are presenting you today, Nokia 6060. It is made to meet the demand of all users, who long for style and good functionality. The phone does not have a camera. Yet, I have no fear that it will suffer lack of attention.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Small, but with external antenna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6060 has a body of 85 × 44 × 24 mm. The quoted height does not include the antenna, which is 1.5 cm long. On one hand, mobiles with antennas seem to be loosing popularity nowadays. On the other hand, there is a certain group of customers, who are looking for exactly this type of phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Live pictures of Nokia 6060 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatsoever, we decided to classify the presence of an external antenna as a minus for Nokia 6060, mainly because in today's mobile world it is no more a problem for a built-in antenna to achieve a high-quality signal reception. The one of Nokia 6060 seems quite easy to break and what's more, it creates mysterious bulges. The phone weighs 93 grams. Although we can effortlessly find even lighter clamshells on the market, this Nokia model still belongs to the group of the small and light ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6060 open </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has been presented in two color versions. Both are marked by a solid chromium-covered frame, but differ in the design of the covers. The latter can be either black or silver. I admit that the silver version corresponds better with my gusto, most of all because the black plastic material used in the other is glossy and reflects every finger print. Not to mention the fact that the surrounding chromium frame does not look that cheap when placed next to the silver cover.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Red alert<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's pay a little bit more attention to outlook of the phone. The most attractive element on its front upper part is the narrow red strip of the status LED. The diode emits white light. What adds the magenta shade is the tiny red plate placed under the small glass cover. The LED is very strong. It can be seen even at daylight. Good news is that there is no need to turn Nokia 6060 face down at night, as it happens with some mobiles with the so called "disco lights".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a status LED on the front upper part of the phone... </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pity here is that the LED is not equipped with different color for incoming message or missed call alerts. It just keeps on blinking in silence in one and the same way, no matter what comes in. When the phone rings, it blinks twice and then takes a long break before it repeats the alert. Well pals, there is no doubt that you will get used to Nokia's functional system. We have seen smarter phones though, haven't we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>... it blinks in red </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the phone are perfectly unoccupied. There is no wavy element, no control key, no volume button...The bottom part is the only exception, being equipped with two connectors - the charger and the handsfree set ones. Between the connectors is the Plug-and-play slot, which Nokia first promoted as a new alternative interface to co-exist with Pop-Port. At the same time, by this very moment Nokia has not manufactured a cable to serve Plug-and-Play. Or this connector has been elaborated for service aim only? Why has it been given such a "multimedia" name then?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6060 from all sides </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loud speaker is embedded somewhat deeper on the opposite side of the body, right next to the antenna. The speaker is secured by a fine grid. When you switch to the built-in handsfree while in the middle of a phone call, the sound performance is not only quiet, but is also accompanied by an unpleasant hissing noise, if set a bit louder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Outer antenna and loud speaker's grid </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Breathing silently behind the back cover is the Li-Ion accumulator, with a capacity of 760 mAh and a maximum stand-by of 400 hours or 210 minutes of talk time. Unfortunately, I have not had the time to test the phone thoroughly in order to confirm if those numbers are true or false. I guess, however, that the realistic times are approximately half the ones officially published.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Removing the back cover ? battery ? SIM card slot ? SIM card mechanism</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Open again and again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once the opposition of the connecting spring has been broken down, the display lights up, the second part of its mechanism gets activated and picks off the upper wing of the shell upwards. In order that the closing back-move is safe, there are two rubber spring bumpers at the corners of the phone, just below the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two tiny rubber spring bumpers under the keypad </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the keys - they are praiseworthy. Even though they are only barely protruded, they are comfortable and decent. They are made of hard plastic. They all are easy-to-press and react properly without exception. Nokia 6060 has apparently followed the example of the 6030 model it has copied its large control keys, whose main characteristic is the extremely low uplift. As a result, work with this phone is a pure pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main control buttons are really big and comfortable ? buttons stand out only as much as it is necessary</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire inside part of the phone is designed in black. It looks really good. The surface is matt, so finger prints are not visible. The overall impression is only disturbed by the main four-way control key with its confirming middle part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keypad's backlighting is blue-white and is strong enough where it is most necessary: below number and letter keys. Every three horizontally located keys are light-framed. A bit less light intensity has been conferred on the call-control keys, the context keys and the main control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad in the dark </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display in Nokia 6060 is 35 mm high and 28 mm wide. It has been made with the help of TFT active technology and is able to show 65K colors. In terms of picture quality it hits the current middle class. 128 × 160 pixels on such a big surface is not much, but is enough. The display is especially easy-to-read in direct sun light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display at daylight ? and in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of external display is quite significant disadvantage. You will need to open the phone almost constantly - an action that may turn to be especially unpleasant, if done with one hand. If you do not open it, you will not be able to see who has called you, nor will you quickly read a newly received message. At the same time, the market is rife with competitors with two displays, all in the same price category.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Menu and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The menu is identical to the one of all other recent Nokia Series 40 models. The main menu is possible to view either as a matrix, or as a list of tiny icons, the choice is up to you. The icons displayed in a matrix are animated. The pictures placed next to the titles often have subunits in the second or even in the third sub-level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Menu in matrix design ? or as a list ? pictures in menu's deeper level</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the device is in a stand-by mode, the left context key opens the "Go to" menu, which can be further customized according to one's own will. The right key helps assign a selected tag of the menu. This is true for all ways of the main control button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Different backgrounds </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main button settings ? right context key options ? and left context keys options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very convenient extra, especially for the stand-by mode graphics, is the font color select option. White or light font converts what used to be a nightmare, when one was trying to read numbers or text displayed on dark wallpaper, into a normal reading process. But be careful, because if you set up an utterly dark scheme (not just wallpaper), all your excitement will vanish away. Modified font color only makes sense as far as the main display is concerned. In the rest of the menu levels titles and legends remain almost invisible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Selecting font color for the main screen ? color set selection</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before I forget, I'd rather mention the fact that Nokia 6060 is a surprisingly fast device. Displaying the main menu is the longest operation in the phone - it takes about one second. In all other cases the phone reacts really quickly, not to say immediately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pick up my number and make a call...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone fits in up to 500 contact names, each of which can be assigned five types of phone numbers, email, a web address and a note of the incredible 110 characters. All contacts can be sorted into groups. The groups alone are possible to differentiate by a picture and a ringtone. Individual names can be accompanied by a picture only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> A view into the phonebook ? tags assigned to a single contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a contact person with attached picture calls you, the picture has priority over the group picture. The lack of a distinguishing ringing melody for individual contacts can be eluded by creating a group with a single member. This does not cause difficulties in the phonebook for there the groups and the contacts are displayed separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is Kvetoslav calling, who has been assigned a picture of headphones </paragraph>
			<paragraph>By gradually entering characters you get to the particular recipient. Both contacts from the SIM card and those saved in the memory of the phone can be displayed simultaneously; every newly created contact gets saved into the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Viewing options ? searching contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6060 shows the phonebook in four different ways: standard small list with names, a big name and the main number (this type is possible to assign to each individual contact), a list of names displayed in a huge font, and finally, a phonebook, in which each contact is accompanied by a picture. Each contact has its detail view, which hides all assigned information. The detail view is entered through the confirming middle part of the main control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Viewing options ? font size can be truly big</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>... or write a message<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a three message editors: for standard SMS, for MMS and for instant messaging. If you need to attach a picture or a sound clip to a MMS, it should not be a problem. You can also add a note from the calendar or a business card from the phonebook. Keep in mind, however, that the message cannot exceed 100 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message editor ? creating MMS ? various options for inserting an object ? view at a MMS Editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS writing is a cheerful experience. Messages can be 6 x 160 characters long. Keys react promptly, even after a significant amount of characters have been written. If you want to be even faster, activate the T9 dictionary and you will notice the difference. T9 knows basic words and learns new ones quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Countdown starts from the first written character and resets every 160 characters. For those with weaker eyes there is a menu option that modifies the font size. There are three sizes to choose from. The tiniest one lets you see an entire SMS altogether. The biggest font is truly big. Come to that - have a glance at the photos of the display. Once done, the setting you have selected is used for the incoming messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Selecting the right font size ? small ? middle ? big</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the melody, with which Nokia 6060 alerts you about new messages, it is only up to you to decide. You can pick up any of the sound files saved in the phone. The pity is that it is a hard task to get a new melody into the device, for it does not allow connection through a cable, nor does it support Bluetooth or infrared. 6060 only works with WAP. And here comes another difficulty: try to download a few pictures, themes and melodies and you will end up with full phone memory. The latter is 3 MB. No more. No less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've got a new message!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The polyphony is 16-channels one. The phone has two dozens of pre-installed ringtones. Nokia 6060 works with MP3 files too. I have already complained once about the performance of the built-in speaker when I activated the loud handsfree set and I am going to do it once again now. The problem is that when you set the volume to 65% and more, the sound gets distorted and almost unrecognizable. Ringing profiles are possible to modify. In addition, Nokia 6060 offers 2 memory spots for the user to create their own profiles from the very beginning. The expiry date can also be set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Let me just appoint a date...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>According to Nokia 6060 the week starts on Saturday, on Sunday, or even on Monday. The choice is yours. The calendar is very well organized and offers all possible views: a month, a week and a day one. It also allows for a reminder and a note to be saved, both of which can be no longer than a standard SMS - 160 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Month view ? week view at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar includes birth dates as well. Yet, it would have come handier, if the birth dates were saved together with the contact names. I mean, if they are entered in the phonebook and then automatically copied into the calendar. All types of events (not only birth dates) can be set to repeat after a certain period of time or be alert about at a selected moment in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Creating an event ? alert view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task editor is far from complicated, but still quite usable. Once successfully done, the pre-set tasks can be marked off. Individual notes may have up to 3000 characters, i.e. far more than those in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> A single note fits in up to 3000 characters</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any deleting in both writing messages and text entering has been freed of the classical disappearance of all characters one by one, caused by a press and a long hold of the correcting key. Instead, in the message menu there is a delete-all option, which I miss in large text files like the long notes, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Day view at an event ? detail of selected event ? task manager ? detail of selected task</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the functions in the organizer are old and well known. The calculator keeps multiplication and dividing disadvantaged. It is equipped with a simple currency converter with 10 spaces for the result to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator and its options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the time functions, the phone offers a stopwatch with meantime and lap time as well as a countdown option and an alarm clock. The alarm clock features a repeating option on any weekday, ringing selection option and a repeating alarm delay of one second up to 100 hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Who can't do with the currency converter in the calculator, they may find satisfaction in the "Converter II" application, which offers everything you could ever need: currencies, weighs, lengths, surface measures and capacities, and in addition, a self-definable coefficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Currency and unit converter: Converter II </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I guess some of you may find the so called "Expense Manager" efficient. It helps the user count up their daily and monthly expenses, which are sorted into various categories. Once you have received your salary, go to the "Plan" option, where you can make your preliminary budget for the coming month. The phone allows you to use more than one currency, which comes in handy if you travel a lot, but be sure to define them first. There is also an option that lets you lock all details saved into this application in order that your friends do not get to find out how much you can afford to spend in a month.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Surf and fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6060 supports GPRS Class 6. Once you manage to download an entire WAP or simple web page, you can enjoy it in 10 lines and color pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Entering addresses ? simple web page</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for Nokia's fun applications, they are materialized in four games. Water supply piping is constructed in Canal Control, Galaxy Balls is basically a ball-point Tetris, Miki's World is an amusing jumping game, and finally, Solitaire, which does not need to be presented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Canal Control ? Galaxy Balls ? Miki's World ? Solitaire</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well, it does not connect with other devices... but it surely connects people...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I would have been happy if I could see this slogan printed on Nokia 6060's box. Let me explain: the phone lacks both Bluetooth and infrared. What a pity, indeed... Anyway, the phone is prepared to match its owner's outlook and behaviour as precisely as possible. But what will you have of it, since there is nothing to make you feel original and different from the other Nokia 6060's owners?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's it, fellows! Nokia 6060 allows you to download new sounds or pictures in no other way, but through the expensive WAP technology. And don't even dare think of how much your friends would have liked to send you "the latest hit"!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words, Nokia 6060 is connecting people, even though it is not capable of connecting itself to surrounding devices. It is offered for approximately ?140 and I do not doubt it will occupy a front place in the window cases. It is just the type of middle-class, non-sophisticated handset, which is a bit more expensive that it could have been in terms of offered equipment. The style, elegance and label however are all here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6060 has something extraordinary </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fanatic Nokia fans will surely be satisfied users of this phone. Others may start to peep at mobile phones, manufactures by Samsung - the expert in clamshells, such as the camera-equipped ? X640 or E330 which also features an external color display. Not only have these models a built-in antenna, but they are also offered for less than 170 euros. If you are more into edge design, you may consider the long-eared Siemens CF75.</paragraph>
