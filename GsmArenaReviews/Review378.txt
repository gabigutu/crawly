			<paragraph>Well, the story continues with the next exciting Chocolate mobile phone from the Black Label series of LG. The new contender has received a serious hardware upgrade and strives for making up for the main criticism to the original Chocolate - it aims to prove that style doesn't need come on the expense of functionality. With a 2 megapixel autofocus camera, a QVGA TFT display, a microSD memory card slot and FM radio, the LG Chocolate Platinum seems to have it all to win the hears of even the most pretentious ones. So bear with us as we review the device in detail.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main Disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Building on the success of the original KG800 Chocolate the KE800 Chocolate Platinum uses the same touch sensitive navigation keypad and follows the exquisite design line making the handset more of a refined accessory than just a regular mobile phone. The updated music player and camera really open the device to a wider market niche and would provide a sure market success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KE800 Platinum waiting silently for your touch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum derives its name from the combination of black or white with a platinum color metal stripe across the front panel. There is yet another version - the LG Chocolate Gold which of course is offered with gold trimming, but alas it is a CDMA mobile and will be targeted at the Korean market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the retail package, the contents of the box remain yet unknown and would probably be market and country dependant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>As fashionable as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum has pretty much the same measures as the original one - it's only 2 mm thicker and weighs 95 g which makes it 10 g heavier. The front panel design is pretty much the same - same glossy mirror-like surface. Design wise, the KE800 is styled in a much manlier fashion that its predecessor which seemed to us as a more feminine model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        The LG Platinum compared to the original LG Chocolate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad of the LG KE800 Platinum is much like the one on the original model - the concept is pretty much the same. You slide it open and it activates waiting for your commands. This time though it's made much more precise - you have to touch straight onto the red markings in order for the mobile to accept your command. A couple of millimeters away and touching brings no effect at all. What is more, the backlighting strength is a far less intensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum front side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset incorporates only a volume swing key and the external antenna jack. It should have come with a cap but the unit we got to test had been through a lot of hands and it took some damage along the way. The end result is that our test sample has all the traces of some heavy usage - but we won't let that ruin our impressions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum left side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side has more to show. There we see a dedicated camera key, mp3 player shortcut key and the ON/OFF key. The ON/OFF key in fact serves the additional role of ending or rejecting a call. The mp3 player shortcut button has also a dual function. When the slider is closed, it only activates the touchpad which is off by default. When the slider is opened, it turns on the music player. The left side of the panel also accommodates the multi-purpose USB/earphones/charger port which is hidden under a protective cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum right side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back part has a rather clean design. When the phone is opened you could see the camera lens, the LED flash and a self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum back side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is situated in the lower back part and is part of the 800 mAh Lithium-Ion Polymer LGLP-G8DM battery itself. According to the manufacturer the battery should offer up to 270h of standby time and up to 6h of talk time which speaks of an updated performance in comparison to the original LG Chocolate. Of course those numbers are for general information only. Unfortunately, we couldn't test the KE800 battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum battery removed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and the top parts of the slider are pretty identical and don't feature any control keys. They have some cheap-looking metallic paint finish, which as seen on our test unit would end up scratched after some time.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feels like butter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slider mechanism opens with an ease but it won't open incidentally by itself in your pockets or bag since the retaining/opening spring is stiff enough to prevent that. In fact the opening of the phone feels very pleasant and its smooth surface definitely adds up to that feeling. It must be noted that the original Chocolate's spring is much tighter though. What is more, unlike the Samsung sliders for example, there is no thumb rest to help you thumb push up or pull down the upper part of the body. With the original LG Chocolate that was just fine, since the only down side to that were the fingerprints left after opening or closing it. This time there is one new downside - if you happen to accidentally touch the touchpad during closing, you might trigger an unwanted action. For example you can open the New Text Message form or the Phonebook list and they would stay open even after you close the mobile. That problem was not present in the original Chocolate because sliding down the upper panel terminated all open interface menus, thus if you accidentally start an action during slide down, it would end automatically when you close the slider all the way down.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>When it lights up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being all glossy, the outer surface catches fingerprints exceptionally easy. The touchpad buttons surely take some time to get used to. But after the original Chocolate appeared in almost every store it no longer does feel like such a revolutionary thing. In fact chances are that most of you that are reading this review right now already have hands-on experience with the touchpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad uses conductivity in order to operate, so basically you activate the button with the electrolyte on you fingers skin. The manufacturer advises not to touch the touch pad with metallic objects and never to use it with wet fingers and even wipe moisture from the touch pad if there is some because otherwise it might damage the sensors. We unsuccessfully tried pressing the touch pad with a pencil so we might conclude that it isn't likely that you could press some keys incidentally in your pocket. What is more the touch pad is automatically deactivated when the slider is closed. It's also deactivated when you make a call since otherwise you might press who-knows-what with your cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to navigating with touching instead of pressing, the menu navigation works like a charm and the menu response is very quick - in fact this menu system has one of the greatest response times we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric keypad is exceptionally good though with decent sized and well spaced keys that are very easy to distinguish even without looking at them. The only downside to it is that the top row is somehow hard to reach comfortably while typing, but we've seen worse slider keypads than this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is pretty good. We want to point out that when you turn on the Power Saving feature of the phone the backlighting of the numeric keypad also gets constantly turned off. Otherwise when you don't use the phone all lights go out and in order to check for missed calls, received messages or simply what time it is you should open the slider or just turn on the display by pressing the MP3 player key. When the key lock is turned on closing the slider locks the availability of user input unless you open it up back again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The keypad in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the KE800 is again 262K colors, but has received a serious upgrade to QVGA (240x320 pixels) resolution. In fact somehow maybe due to the screen font used on the standby screen it reminds us a lot the display used in Sony Ericsson K800 which has the same resolution. In fact it even has the same diagonal of 2" - funny thing, heh, - KE800 and K800 come with almost (if not!) the same display. The display horizontal viewing angle is the same as the one in LG KG800, but the vertical one is far better. Legibility of the display under direct sunlight is very good with one exception - and that is reading something under sunlight when the there are some fingerprints left on the display. Other than that, the display of the LG KE800 is a great one and is perfectly on par with the current high-end models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The display in the dark</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ringing on the downside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our overall impression is that the phone is fairly good at what it was built mainly for - making and receiving calls. Its sounds nice but unfortunately, it seems that the original LG Chocolate sounded better and louder. The sound of the KE800 speaker is not among the loudest but at least it's got one, right? The original Chocolate didn't have a dedicated loudspeaker and used the speaker that you use for conversations on the front panel for the ringing melodies. The vibration on the LG KE800 is not that strong too. The MP3 ringing is also nice and clear but really lacks bass elements. Talking about loudspeakers, it's worth mentioning now that the phone has got a dedicated loudspeaker, you will be able to make use of it during a call - something impossible with the original Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calling our friend Dexter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the handset has a very good signal reception and the voices during call have a pleasant depth and sufficient loudness. That provides for pleasant conversations even in noisy streets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same interface but with a twist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the handset displays info about the battery status and signal strength. The carrier's name can be turned off and we find that a really pleasant feature that should be seen in other phones too. In standby the two soft keys correspond to the Main Menu and the Contacts menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a 3 x 3 grid of icons which get animated when you select them. Their graphics is really fine as opposed to the one of the original LG Chocolate. We must admit that the overall color scheme and icons match perfectly the design of the phone. And if you look carefully the design of the main menu grid you will notice that each icon is positioned in a black square which in fact copies the design of the numeric keys. Subsequently, you can use the corresponding numeric keys as shortcuts for the menu items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus are viewed as a list. Once you open a menu item you can scroll to the other menu items with the horizontal arrows on the navigation touchpad without the need for returning to the main menu. Here are the nice wallpapers that come preinstalled with the handset. They are pretty much the same as the ones in the original LG Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the preset wallpapers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no themes available for customizing the looks of the interface, but there is the option to change the menu style. Beside the regular 3x3 grid you are given the opportunity to use the new Arc style menu which is really great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Arc style menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby the four navigation keys each have a predefined shortcut function. If you wish you could visualize the respective assigned functions of the standby screen in order to make your life easier. We found it a preferred option in the first couple of days we used the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the LEFT key takes you to the Ringing profiles shortcut menu. Pressing the DOWN key naturally takes you to the Phonebook list. Pressing the RIGHT key takes you to a Favorites menu which is a list of shortcuts which is user-configurable. Pressing the UP key takes starts a new text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby screen shortcut menu ? Favorites menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a good thing that all the submenu items have numeric shortcuts assigned to them. You can see those in front of every menu item while browsing the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Numeric shortcut icons in the beginning of each row</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an interesting option to colorize the phone numbers when dialing in order to distinguish the individual numbers more easily. Or you can choose the other dialing graphics mode that is also interesting. Whether you would like one of those is entirely up to your taste, of course.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An updated phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the original Chocolate was among the greatest disappointments since one can live with a slow camera or a poor resolution screen in a mobile handset but you cannot do without a decent phonebook. All of this has changed though and now we see a really upgraded version of what used to be a lousy phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts capacity is 1000 contacts which is more than enough for most users. Search is performed through gradual typing of a name's characters. The phonebook allows the storing of 4 numbers /mobile, home, office, fax/ and an email. Further on the contact can be included into a caller group or can be assigned a picture. You can add a note to the contact too. It's good to see that the phonebook has received a facelift and now looks much more user friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook ? Various contact fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned any contact can be assigned a picture. The original KG800 was pretty much handicapped in that respect since it allowed only .bmp pictures to be used with 72 x 72 pixels size. Now you are free to use any picture of your choosing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting solution is the option to view the contacts list along with the respective pictures. It's a cool, but poses certain inconvenience since the picture hides some characters from the contacts names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the contacts with pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice upgrade to the phonebook is that now you can assign a ringtone to individual contacts. The only way to do that in the original KG800 is by including the contact in a caller group and assigning a specific ringtone to the caller group itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has several preinstalled caller groups which can be customized. Each caller group has its icon and that can be shown in front of the respective members' names in the contacts list in order to recognize easily which group they belong to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Caller groups list with their respective icons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last upgrade to mention is that you can now save a second or a third number to an already existing contact directly from the standby screen. There is no longer need to find the specific contact beforehand and enter the Edit mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing special in the call records department. They are available as a separate item in the main menu and also can be accessed by pressing the call (receiver) key on the touch pad. In fact pressing the call key takes you to the general list of all dialed, received and missed calls. It has a capacity of 20 numbers. If you wish to see the separate registers you have to go to the abovementioned Call History menu item. The GPRS data counter is also available in the Call History menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Call register menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text besides voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, EMS, MMS and email messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message you are given the option of choosing among a text message, multimedia message and an email message. If you choose the text type further on you could easily change it by just attaching multimedia content to it and thus turn it into an EMS or MMS. EMS functionality is not on the level of the original LG Chocolate for some unknown reason. There you could type with highlighted text, set the text alignment, etc. None of those features is available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages menu ? starting a new message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message typing is assisted by T9. A nice upgrade to the functionality of the message composer is that in order to type a number in your message you no longer need to change to numeric mode (123) and then back to text mode (abc) but you can enter numbers with a longer press of the alphanumeric keys. This is a standard feature in almost all contemporary phones but lacked in the original LG KG800 Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One nice feature is that if you have started a new message and all of a sudden you have to cancel its typing, it's saved automatically as a draft and next time you decide to start a new message the phone not only stores it for you but automatically opens it for you to continue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature is that the phone keeps a record of the last numbers you have sent messages to and when sending a new one you can choose among them instead of digging down in the full phonebook list. It's a feature we would like to see in more phones nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports the POP3 and SMTP protocols and as regards sending and receiving text emails it successfully does it job as we managed to found out during the test period. As regards emails with file attachments it poses rather strict limitations. The maximum size for one sent or downloaded message is 300 KB. In case you have received message with more than 5 attachments, only 5 of them will be received. For each e-mail account you may save up to 50 messages (totally 150 for three accounts), while in the Inbox you can store up to 30 messages for each account. The other 20 slots are reserved for the Drafts and Outbox folders. A good thing is that there is an option to provide a separate username and password for the SMTP server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Retrieving emails ? reading an email</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice MP3 player, bad file browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The File manager appears as a My stuff item in the main menu. It includes separate factory preset folders for different multimedia content. In fact these folders are the only one you will see since the file manager doesn't actually support user-created folders. You can create such folders using the computer and the USB cable of course, but they do not get listed in the My Stuff menu. There also aren't any options for marking, copying or moving files between folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> My Stuff menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the file browser provides basic functionality and is not really that user-friendly. You no longer need to view picture files by opening and closing them one by one. These added features to the file manager in fact made the Photo album application of the original Chocolate obsolete. But still there is no zoom or fullscreen mode for detailed preview of the pictures and opening and browsing an image folder in thumbnail mode seems to take forever. But who knows, that might as well be fixed in the final version of the mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   List and thumbnail view ? Opening an image</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser no longer offers a dedicated Text folder where you can save .txt files and read them later. You can of course store such files but cannot read them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of memory card slot, a flight mode, and playlist support made the music player of the original LG Chocolate rather inadequate. Some of those issues have been taken care of in the LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum. There is a memory card slot; there is even a flight mode. But still, there isn't an option for creating custom playlists - the player lists all the available MP3 files. And what is more, you still can't sort them according to artist or album but only by file name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice addition to the visual effects of the player is the real sound spectrum visualization. The player cannot work in the background. There are several equalizer presets that you can use in order to enhance the player sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio of the LG KE800 is rather simple but does its job satisfactory. It has a nice AutoScan feature which allows for easy storing of the 12 available positions. It doesn't support RDS and it doesn't offer the option to store names for the stored stations. You would have to plug the headset in order to start the radio, but after they are plugged in, you can listen to it through the integrated loudspeaker.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera sounded exciting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Right off the start we are excited to test the 2 megapixel camera with autofocus. It turned out that the camera itself is not that better than the one in the original Chocolate. The only differences would be the maximum resolution of 1600x1200 pixels and the dubious benefit of the so called auto focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth is that the auto focus was not that good at its job and often missed the intended subjects. The camera application itself is rather slow and it takes around 10 seconds to take a picture at the maximum resolution and save it. 4 of those precious seconds go for the auto focus to accommodate to your subject. Well all that means is that you should forget about capturing images of fast moving subjects. The autofocus only really shined in Macro mode which proved great for taking pictures of text. We hope that the autofocus issues would be fixed in the final version. There is a LED flash which is there to help you in poor light conditions. Speaking of poor light conditions, the camera has a night mode which does it job very well and compared to night modes in similar cameras produces relatively low photo noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera viewfinder in portrait and landscape ? Using the LED flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also offers 4x digital zoom which is not available at the maximum resolution though but this is not that great of a loss since it produces a mere crop &amp; resize of the original image. The camera menu offers option such as picture resolution, brightness level, the white balance that has several presets according to the available light conditions, and some color effects such as sepia, black &amp; white, negative, etc. Beside the regular Single shot mode the camera can also capture images in Multi shoot mode. At least there is one upgrade over the original camera software seen in KG800 - you can setup several options without having to enter the setup menu individually for each one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Various camera settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the picture quality is fine if you managed to hold the phone perfectly still during image capturing. As we already said, the camera is awfully slow. There is a delay between the press of the button and the actual capturing of the photo. That means that most of the time the composition you want to take a shot at has already changed when the actual photographing takes place. Generally, you are could be easily misled by the long time it takes the camera to make the picture and deciding that it should have already taken the picture you could move a bit. That way you would turn the picture into an unrecognizable blur. But after all is said and done, there is no place for comparison between the quality produced by that camera and the one of cameraphones with auto-focus such as Sony Ericsson K750 and company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting thing is that the camera view finder, similar to that of Samsung D600 we should add, doesn't display the full picture that the camera actually takes. In a way the viewfinder somewhat zooms the image and the left and right sides of the picture are cut outside the viewable area. You can't even see the whole picture after you take it and save it. It's only after you download the photos on your PC that you would actually see what's hidden in those invisible borders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking the camera is not very user friendly and its usability suffers from the shutter lag and the cropped image view finder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KE800 - samples in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Photos downsampled to 800x600 resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also captures video in maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and the output format is the usual .3gp. The menu of the video camera is pretty much the same as the one we already described for the still camera with few exceptions. It offers both limited and unlimited recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KE800 video sample</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features full USB support and the LG USB cable comes along in the retail box along with the phone itself. The great thing about the USB support of the phone is that when connected it appears in the Windows explorer as a removable drive just as your regular USB flash drive would and no drivers are needed. If you receive a call whilst in mass storage mode, the call will be rejected but after you disconnect the handset, you will see the information about any missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby display while in USB drive mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need any other type of synchronization between the phone and the PC like for items such as the phonebook and the schedule you should use the dedicated LG software LGPCSync that comes on CD along with the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No change in Internet department<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As much as connectivity is concerned, the phone features 3-band GSM 900/1800/1900 and GPRS support for fast data transfers, as well as Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile for listening music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated WAP browser doesn't have full HTML support and managed to open only simple HTML pages such as Google. It's a regular WAP browser used in older phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The clumsy browser</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's organize<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward - it offers a monthly view for navigation among the dates. Once you find the date you need, simply enter it and add an event. The first day of the week according to the calendar is Sunday - something that's not that common around whole Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Adding a task to the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text Memos allow for storing some notes. Each note can have a maximum of 80 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Adding a text memo</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Tools menu also stores some useful applications, though they seem rather standard nowadays. There are the Alarm clock, the Calculator, the Unit converter, the World time clock, and the Voice recorder. The Alarm clock menu allows for setting only one alarm, which can be repeated. It's a certain downgrade since the original KG800 allowed for the setting of 5 different alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Basic alarm clock: only one alarm!?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator offers rich scientific functions which seem pretty out of place here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The overcomplicated calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Unit Converter also has a nice list of units such as Area, Length, Weight, and Volume. The one in the original LG Chocolate had a lot more units to pick from. May be their lack here is again a software problem that would be remedied in the final version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Unit converter application ? converting area units</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder application has no limitation in the duration of the recorded files as on the KG800. On top of that the KE800 has a lot more sensitive microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The voice recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing with numbers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone we tested had two preinstalled game - Pump it up and the SUDOKU Puzzle. The SUDOKU is a logical puzzle game with a lot of mathematics involved. The other game involves the use of the alphanumeric keys. You are supposed to press them according to the visual orders that come up on the screen. The quicker and the more precise you are, the more points you win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sudoku puzzle game &amp; Pump It Up game</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, that's it - our journey with the latest addition to the Black Label series is over and once again we are left with somewhat mixed feelings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the guys at LG have taken their time and in fact listened to the fans and fixed most of the issues the original Chocolate had. But there are a good number of them left and the Chocolate's big brother raises some new ones for sure. Our greatest criticism last year was the phonebook - the software part that got almost all upgrades it needs so we are pretty happy with it now. This time it would be the web browser that would take the plunge, since such an inadequate application has no place in a technologically advanced mobile handset like the KE800 Chocolate Platinum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet we saw a nice shift in the target group of the Platinum version due to its masculine design. The addition of a memory card slot was seen as the biggest positive change since it allows for more versatile usage of the device and clearly states its multimedia orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all is said and done, the time spent with the LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum was a nice one. We did enjoy its company and we are pretty happy with the increased functionality it offers over its little brother. It has some great looks and it would most definitely be among the strongest fashion statements in your arsenal this year.</paragraph>
