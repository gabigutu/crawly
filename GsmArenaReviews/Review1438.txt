			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gadgets have become so important they're a part of how people look at you. A phone can tell a lot about who you are. Fashion phones? well? let's say they leave little to the imagination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are handsets that make an impression without breaking the bank. Others have big spender written all across their beautiful handcrafted bodies. But let's face it, some phones are just as subtle as a yacht the size of a small aircraft carrier that you lovingly call "the boat".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like it or not (and let's be honest here - we all like it) mobile phones are long beyond the calling and texting. In honesty, today's story is more about the shopping and spending but who says a phone should be all about speed, skill and tech? Oh, whoa, wait a minute. We usually do, don't we? Alright, fine, but let's pretend. Maybe there's a bit of that in all of us and looking our best is sometimes as important as staying in touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be looking back at mobile phones that we normally dismiss as overpriced and underspec'd. But if history has taught us anything, it's that fashion phones are here to stay. They have their customers and, hard as it may be for your average phone geek to admit it, do carry their own value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the high-end smartphones are impressive gadgets but they don't quite make sense for all dress codes. In certain places, a designer phone will give you all the Wow effect you might need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From makers that specialize in limited edition diamond-encrusted handsets to designer-branded mass-produced phones, there is more than one way to play the game. We're back after the break to warm up with those mass market handsets that sport a designer logo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fashion for the masses<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>These are the cheapest of the bunch and understandably get no standing ovation. See, exclusivity or at least rareness is half the purpose of spending on a fashion device. However, co-branded phones do keep the price within reasonable limits, so a lot of people end up buying them. Well, may be not that many after all, but more than you would like seeing around carrying the same phone as you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the devices in this class are an easy way for the average Joe to feel special. Plus some of them were pretty good to use as an everyday phone too, which helped them get very positive reviews. A designer-branded device will obviously be more expensive than a phone with similar specs but no fancy logo. People do seem to think the feel and finish are worth it though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of the Prada phones was certainly the most popular device in this class. It was the first full-touch feature phone and used a capacitive touchscreen, which was extremely rare at the time. It was accordingly over-priced but still surprisingly popular - sales exceeded 1 million units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same year, Armani stepped in and helped Samsung design the P520 Armani. The compact touchscreen bar even went as far as to feature the exclusive Croix interface. We are quite sure the interface is the last thing to notice on a fashion phone but the P520 Armani did look great on the outside. The leather case gave it a nice masculine look, which otherwise escaped the tiny device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Armani and Prada couldn't keep that shape and their next branded phones were a lot less fortunate. Neither the (literally) flashy Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani, nor the huge QWERTY messenger Samsung B7620 or the LG KF900 Prada did look particularly stylish or well built.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They might have been decent phones but none of them was doing too well as a fashion accessory. And that was exactly what users would care about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dolce&amp;Gabbana was the latest fashion name to give the mobile phone market a try with their exclusive edition of the Sony Ericsson Jalou. The result was mediocre to put it as subtly as we can. It might have had a chance as a girl's gadget but no self-respecting man would ever use that in public. We wouldn't touch it with a stick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To conclude this chapter, we'd say that if you want a device to compliment your overall style and serve as an accessory, the ones we just mentioned (well, some of them anyway) will do the trick just fine without breaking the bank. But if you want your phone to steal the spotlight for you, you need to keep looking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pr?t-?-porter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's face it - an Armani branded phone is like a t-shirt with the Armani logo. It's got the stamp but it's not an Armani suit, not by a long shot. We're slowly venturing into luxury item territory, but we'll stay in the more reasonable range for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The type of phone we'll be looking at here is the Nokia 8-series or say? the Motorola Aura. They cost (or did when they came out anyway) around 1000 euro and are a status symbol without being collector's items reserved for millionaires only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reason we start with the Nokia 8-series. The Nokia 8910 was one of the earliest examples of a luxury phone. Its titanium body slid smoothly open thanks to a spring assisted mechanism and it came with a leather pouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It really set the tone for the rest of the 8-series to come. Soon after it, the Nokia 8910i update added a color screen to the mix. But enough history, let's look at more recent phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 is what came after the 8910i and spawned a slew of successors. It dropped titanium in favor of stainless steel but kept the tradition of dropping a few extra treats in the box: a desktop stand, an extra battery and a leather carrying pouch, not to mention the exclusive ringtones composed especially for the 8800 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is important because the phone had about the same functionality as the much cheaper Nokia 6230i. The premium accessories justified the exorbitant price and added to the experience of owning a Nokia 8800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It too got the upgrade treatment with the Nokia 8800 Sirocco edition. The Sirocco bumped up the specs, added a Bluetooth headset to the package but most importantly it was available in Gold. 18 carat gold plating is something we'll see Nokia go back to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8600 Luna is an offshoot of the 8800 - with a body made of stainless steel, its claim to fame was the smoked semi-translucent glass covering the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest branch in the 8800 family tree is the Arte series. The first two - the Nokia 8800 Arte and 8800 Sapphire Arte - added 3G, an OLED screen with eye-pleasing colors and minor upgrades for the rest of the spec sheet. The Sapphire Arte even had a sapphire stone on the D-pad and genuine leather patches on the front and rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From then on, the Arte family grew with a couple of new editions that emphasize on a certain material. The Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte was first, made of carbon fiber that's found on so many sports cars that the association with racing was unavoidable. Then there was the Nokia 8800 Gold Arte, which opted for gold - a truly timeless luxury item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's it for the Finnish brand for now, we'll meet them again in the next section through their Vertu subsidiary. Now let's look at a couple of phones made famous by their displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Aura (endorsed by no other than David Beckham) took pride in having the world's first circular display. It was even more impressive with its 16 million colors and 300dpi pixel density (the super sharp iPhone 4 display has 326dpi).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is covered by a 62 carat sapphire crystal, the back is stainless steel with chemically etched patterns. The opening mechanism is Swiss-made, complete with a small window to see the gears in action, just like a mechanical watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if that's not enough, the Motorola Aura Diamoniqe added 90 diamonds around the display (for a total of 1 karat). It was genuinely a limited edition, with no more than 50 units released.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly cheaper and less exclusive Motorola Aura Gold has 24 carat gold plating. There are a couple of other versions too. The Diamond edition has 34 diamonds and 18 carat gold plating, while the Celestial edition commemorated the first Moon landing of Apollo 11.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handset in this price range, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness, boasts a unique display too - it's truly transparent. The Pureness was the first and still the only phone from a major manufacturer to have a see-through screen. Too bad it's tiny and monochrome, and shame the Pureness has the overall build quality of a much cheaper phone. But the wow-factor is there, nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung in yet another joint venture, this time with Bang &amp; Olufsen,produced a couple of unique looking (and sounding!) phones too - the Serene and the Serenata.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These phones are sure to turn some heads and tell onlookers you're well off. Sometimes functionality alone doesn't cut it - you need to dress for the occasion. That used to mean a watch, cufflinks, ties and such but now you need a phone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This isn't Victorian England with the strictest of dress codes, but you still have to dress up if you want to make a good impression. And if you need to take a call, few would do better than some of these elegant gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These phones we've mentioned so far are fairly affordable by luxury phone standards. It's the next chapter where prices (and stakes) get higher.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Modesty is not a Vertu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know you are doing a good job when your brand is the first to come to mind when users think about the whole product category. In this particular case, it doesn't matter that the users are so few they're probably on first name terms with each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vertu is the biggest name in luxury phones, spreading over a huge price range. From the relatively modest Constellation series, all the way to the diamond-encrusted Signature, the Nokia subsidiary is virtually unchallenged. Now, this sounds hard to believe but it only gets real scary well above the 100K mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the know-how of the largest phone manufacturer gives Vertu an advantage, but it's their handcrafted bodywork and paramount build quality that earned them their name. After all, it's not the S40 interface that sells these phones. It's things like ruby-bearing keypads and sapphire screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vertu handsets were never famous for their specs. The Constellation lineup is only as good as a 50-dollar handset featurewise. The best you can hope for is a 3.2 megapixel camera on the Ascent Ti or Wi-Fi on the Signature series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important advantage for the company is that it's been around for more than a decade now, which is more than enough to build a reputation as the undisputed leader in luxury phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wide range of offerings also helps here. The cheapest Vertu goes for under 4000 euro, while the Signature diamond costs over 65000. There are of course limited edition Vertu handsets like the Signature Cobra which will set you back a quarter of a million. No one shopping for phones to show off their wealth will have to worry about going over or under their budget - Vertu seem to have a cellphone for all walks of life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all in all, Vertu is the maker of choice if you want a phone to impress onlookers. Popular and easily identifiable, the British-born handsets scream high-quality and leave no doubt about who's in charge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pieces unique<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last but one chapter of this review is dedicated to the most expensive and rare phones out there. You know the ones that cost a fortune and a half, and that you're not sure you'll be able to get even if you had that kind of cash. When there are no more than a hundred units in the world (and in most cases there are a lot fewer) you just can't walk in a store and buy one of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most prominent company in this exclusive segment recently is probably the Canada-based Mobiado. The company prides itself in quite a lot of firsts in the luxury segment. Theirs is the Professional, which was the first first phone CNC machined from solid aircraft aluminum. Last year things were taken to a whole new level with the Grand 350 Pioneer, which has its back cover chunked out of a real piece of meteorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prices in this exclusive range from a layman's are-you-kidding-me to drop-dead expensive and the number of units for each model is usually under fifty. An added bonus is that Mobiado phones are among the few that deliver modern specs. Perhaps it's because they base their creations on real phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other manufacturer of ridiculously expensive piece-of-art phones that makes it in the news more than once every couple of years is Gresso. Famed for their Roman numeral keypads, African Blackwood bodies and gold on the keys and screws, the Gresso handsets are usually cheaper than the Mobiado line. They even sometimes venture in the Vertu territory with sub-10k price tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That of course excludes the Gresso Luxor Las Vegas Jackpot (How do you do), which stretches the imagination with a million-dollar price tag. For that kind of cash you are getting 45.5 K of black diamonds and 200-year old African blackwood. Plus the 12-mm thin frame is made of 180 grams of gold, while the keypad is pure sapphire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last name worth mentioning here is of the Swiss company that created the other million-dollar phone. Remember the "Le Million" PIECE UNIQUE? Of course you do - even if you don't know the actual name, it's easily the most recognizable fashion odd-ball phone in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GoldVish, the maker of this exquisite piece of cellphone art, never actually produced it beyond the prototype we all know. Hardly a manly phone, the "Le Million" Piece Unique is perhaps better suited for the fairer part of our audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Versace may join the party too but we aren't sure how their phone will stack up in terms of affordability. It may be in the same category as Armani's or Prada's phones, but it could also be right there next to some of the insanely expensive handsets ever made. We'll have to wait to learn the details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now Goldvish is still relying on their Illusion series of gold and crocodile skin diamond-encrusted handsets. With prices ranging from 21 000 and 125 000 euro depending on the amount of diamonds on the front, the Illusion handsets are less preoccupied with design than you would guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Why bother when the whole thing is made of pure gold. And their interface has nothing to do with the modern standards of user-friendliness (as we came to learn first-hand not that long ago).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the Illusion series earn extra points for the exchangeable croc-skin backs. Those can be user-replaced so you get several color combos to match your suit. Or underwear. We don't care.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apples and oranges<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Okay admit it - you are a bit surprised to see this one coming out last on top of the rest of the gang. Contrary to the logic of the article so far, the last chapter won't deal with fashion credentials or nominal value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not to say that Apple's latest has less appeal than some of those ultra-expensive devices. It's just a different kind of appeal - the iPhone 4 may not be quite as masculine or rough as a Vertu but has earned its iconic status like much of the usually overpriced Apple gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple have always been famed for their designs and their latest smartphone is certainly one of the hottest looking gadgets. Sleek glass panels and metal frame, plus an ultra-cool large display allow it to stand out next to nearly every other non-gold plated device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for a handset without any diamonds on its back, it's certainly one expensive piece of kit. It's probably the most expensive "regular" smartphone on the market right now - not that the words "regular" and "Apple" are likely to ever meet in a single sentence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But since the latest iPhone is the talk of the town, some people just couldn't resist adding some extra bling to it. Luxury designer Stuart Hughes, for instance, let's you cover it with diamonds, while Gresso would make a case for you out of their exclusive African blackwood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 is selling in millions and some of those limited edition pieces might make sense if you want to be unique. The downside is, the minute the next iPhone sees daylight, the number 4 will be dead fashionwise - no diamonds or Blackwood will help.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Men like their toys - that's for sure. Most of the phones we mentioned however would hardly make it in your regular top-ten-phones-for-men kind of article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overexpensive phones should not be judged by their specs - they sure have their core purpose but there's more to their appeal than just that. Instead these phones are like pieces of jewelry in which form defies function. They make up for their lack of practicality with tons of bling and they are surely good in one thing - making a statement. Whatever their shape or size, they are essentially just another way of dressing up, of expressing your taste, personality, style and even masculinity, if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the most part we looked at the extremes of the spectrum. But along the way you also saw what's in between. We didn't get anywhere near covering the whole fashion market, but at least we think we've got the overall picture right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From everyday tools, these phones have turned into haute couture accessories - sometimes elegant, other times plain awkward. But no matter their looks, fashion phones have one thing in common - they start at expensive and work their way up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since the dawn of humanity, man has always used exquisite artifacts as objects signifying social status. The mobile phone importance in that aspect may have been somewhat overrated but even though the suite doesn't make the man, suiting up can make a man look its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few years ago we would have laughed at all those phones for their overpriced, crude designs, and look at us today, having some fun time overviewing them. Who knows, maybe some day even our penny-pinching souls will succumb to the temptation and we will get one of those exquisite pieces of art for ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ok, not really, but it was good pretending for a while.</paragraph>
