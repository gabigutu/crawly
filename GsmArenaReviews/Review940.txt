			<subsectionTitle>IFA 2013: Acer Liquid S2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Kicking off the festivities here at IFA 2013, Acer has given us a sneak peek of the new Acer Liquid S2 flagship. It's a 6-inch 1080p phablet that is the first to record video in the new ultra high definition 4K format.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Other than that, the main camera shoots 13MP stills and packs a 28mm wide angle lens and a back-lit sensor. Besides capturing 4K UHD video at 24fps, it's also capable of good old 1080p videos at an impressive 60fps, which easily turn into slow motion videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid S2 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While Acer doesn't have the pedigree of some of its competitors in the smartphone game, the Liquid S2 has the potential to be one of the sleeper hits in the holiday quarter, as the first mobile devices to record 4K video (so far, that is - IFA is just getting started). Either way, it's slated for an October release date, so it will definitely be one of the first 4K-video-recording phones you can buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6-inch screen puts the device firmly into phablet territory, which means you'll have to consider carrying it in a bag or clip-on case, as the Liquid S2 is simply too large for a pant pocket. The display itself is nice, however, and the 1080p resolution translates to a very respectable 367 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Solid build is another thing the Liquid S2 has going for it, the nicely-textured matte plastic finish is pleasant to the touch, but the weight is something to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we'll take a closer look at the build quality in detail, as well as how the Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean build with Float UI runs on the quad-core Krait 400 processor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid S2 hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Liquid S2 comes in two color options - black and red. The black paint job features a silver trim, while the red one has a black trim. Both work well and lend to the device aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most notable first impression the Acer Liquid S2 makes is its solid build quality. While Acer didn't provide exact figures, the device feels hefty in-hand - almost overly so - but the solid construction and matte plastic finish on the back make up for the added weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is located at the top of the device, which is very inconvenient and perhaps the Liquid S2's only design flaw. Good thing is you can unlock the phone by a press-and-hold of the home button. As for locking it back... well, you'll have to use the other hand every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side there is a dual speaker setup, while on the left you'll find an uncovered microUSB port, volume rocker, as well as the covered microSIM and microSD card slots. Acer Liquid S2 has a quad-microphone setup for advanced stereo recording. Two of these are located at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device features the 13MP camera capable of 4K video recording. It's surrounded by quad-LED flash ring around the lens, which includes a diffuser that helps immensely when shooting video in low-light at close range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front you'll find the 2MP wide angle shooter located above the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Acer Liquid S2 is seriously good, quite crisp at 367 ppi, with good contrast and pretty wide viewing angles - not the widest we have seen but wide enough not to be a hindrance. One downside, it is, unfortunately, also quite reflective.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid S2 runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with Acer's custom Float UI on top. Our prerelease model still had its fair share of bugs, but you can really feel the Snapdragon 800 kick regardless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick booth demo video which shows off the main features of the Android UI, including Acer's take on floating widgets, and the camera UI.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The real star of the show when talking about the Acer Liquid S2 is the 13MP camera, capable of 4K UHD video recording. The fps is limited to 24 fps, but obviously the resolution the device shoots in is unmatched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've uploaded a 4K UHD (2160p) sample taken directly from the Liquid S2 to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is obviously a fair amount of shakiness that will hopefully be smoothed out in the finalized software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a 2MP front-facing camera on the Liquid S2. Its primary purpose is videoconferencing, although you'll likely use it for taking selfies at parties more than anything.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer has for some time sailed under the radar when it comes to smartphones. The Liquid S2 pins them on the phablet map, and does so with a flourish. While the 4K UHD video shot by the Liquid S2 may not wind up being the best around, particularly if it struggles to maintain 24fps, it is still the only smartphone that can make such a claim. And with an expected October release date, it'll be one of the first 4K smartphones in buyers' hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One major obstacle the phablet faces, however, will be its anticipated high launch price, which makes it bound to face some serious competition. But even though the Liquid S2 may have trouble getting serious market traction, it will certainly do well to herald the emergence of a new strong player in the high-end.</paragraph>
