			<paragraph>Whenever a Galaxy S phone thinks "Boy, it feels good at the top", there's always someone down below to say "You're welcome". Samsung most certainly know who to thank. It was smartphones like the Galaxy Ace and the Galaxy mini that made Android so much more accessible and helped the Koreans get where they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year brings the sequels to the two immensely popular smartphones and things look promising. The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 ups the resolution, adds a bit of extra oomph and improves on the looks and that's already a solid foundation for a worthy successor. Here's what else it gets right and what it doesn't:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the smartphone market still far from becoming a zero sum game, devices like the mini 2 are supposed to convert as many feature-phone and Symbian users as possible. Once they are in the right camp, it will be much easier to sell them a Galaxy S IV or even a Note 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A solid plan indeed, but there's a catch. While the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 price tag will probably help, there are potential turn-offs that need to be addressed. The mini 2 doesn't have to be perfect or have an upmarket feel. A solid smartphone experience is a must though and we're interested to see if the mini 2 delivers it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get going then. The unboxing and hardware inspection start right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package spells basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't really expect Bluetooth headsets, leather pouches or anything along these lines, inside the Samsung Galaxy mini 2's box. Considering the relatively ample inbuilt storage, we can live without a microSD card too, even though it costs manufacturers cents to include. However, we could've really used a wired handsfree, which isn't all that expensive either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you will find inside the compact box is a microUSB charger and a microUSB cable. We do appreciate the charger being a single piece, instead of having to use it with the data cable, but still the feeling remains that Samsung could have done a little better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy mini 2 S6500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 109.4 x 58.6 x 11.6 mm, the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 is a really compact device by today's standards. It's also pleasingly thin for the class and, since it weighs just over 105g, we doubt it that anyone will mind carrying it around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite being low in the pecking order, the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 offers pretty good build quality. The styling of the back looks like a nice touch by Samsung and the grippy plastic makes sure you won't be dropping the smartphone too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main grudge is the front panel, where things are a bit boring. We've seen Samsung use the same design over and over and we really wished we were treated to something fresh here. After all, they did bother to make it look a bit like the Galaxy Nexus at the back. It shouldn't have been too to hard do something about the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps a different color that matches the battery cover might have helped the Galaxy mini 2 stand out in the entry-level droid crowd. Then again, maybe it's just a case of us being too picky. As we said, the mini 2 is targeted at newcomers, who are unlikely to be bored with the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 is dominated by the 3.27" HVGA display. The bezels are a bit wider than we are used to, but there's no way around it on a compact phone like the mini 2. You see, bezels have to be at least a few millimeters wide for a touchscreen device to work properly and that makes them appear much bigger on handsets with smaller screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two ways to look at the image quality of the screen. On one hand, it's a notable improvement over the original, mostly due to the quadruple resolution. On the other hand, contrast is nothing to write home about, while in the same time viewing angles are mediocre and sunlight legibility is disastrous. And then, HVGA is not such a rarity anymore in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the truth is somewhere in between, the mini 2 screen being par for course - no deal-breakers, but no pleasant surprises either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 display, we find the usual three-button combo. There's the traditional Home key in the middle, with capacitive Menu and Back buttons either side. All three controls have the usual functionality on a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you get above the screen is the earpiece, so those of you addicted to video-calling might need to take their business elsewhere. An ambient light sensor is also missing, so you'll have to adjust the brightness of your screen manually. There's no front-facing camera or a proximity sensor either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 S6500 hosts the volume rocker and the microSD card slot. At the other end we have only the power key, but a dedicated camera key wouldn't have made much sense on a smartphone with a fixed focus camera anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy mini 2 is where the 3.5mm audio jack is located, while the microUSB port can be found at the bottom, alongside the microphone. Both the audio jack and the microUSB port are unprotected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the Galaxy mini 2 over we find the 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera lens and the loudspeaker grille. The specs of the camera alone suggest that it wasn't the designer's top priority, but we'll be examining it in more detail later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 1300 mAh Li-Ion juice pack that powers the mini 2. It's said to last for up to 420h of stand-by and up to 6h 50min of talk-time, which is decent if unspectacular. Our battery test the Galaxy mini 2 above average with a rating of 38h. Find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general handling of the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 S6500 is pretty good. It's a compact set that's easy to operate singlehandedly and one that has decent grip. We like the asymmetric styling reminiscent of the Galaxy Nexus but we wish they used something fresher up front.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread with TouchWiz topping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy mini 2 runs on Gingerbread 2.3.6 and has the latest version 4.0 of Samsung's custom TouchWiz launcher. Although it cannot even dream of Ice Cream Sandwich, the phone is reasonably fast and the 800MHz processor has no trouble running Gingerbread. TouchWiz in turn is supplying a good deal of nice little features and decent visuals. Things look good on the HVGA screen (up from QVGA in the original Galaxy Mini) and the handling is not bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at our video of the device in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen of the mini 2 has the usual integration of missed events with shortcuts to the relevant apps. Missed calls and incoming texts are displayed but not emails. The lockscreen can be removed by swiping in any direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreen panes. A pinch on any of them zooms out to an aggregate view of all active homescreen panes, which can then be rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a side-scrollable taskbar at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes. In typical TouchWiz fashion, looped scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can choose List view instead of the default Grid view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. You can swap the first three with different ones (by default the shortcuts are Phone, Contacts, Messaging). The rightmost is the app drawer/home shortcut used to toggle between the apps menu and the homescreen, so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher on the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 is launched by a long press of the Home key. It has a shortcut to a custom task manager, which not only lets you kill apps one-by-one and in bulk, but offers plenty of stats on installations, RAM usage and storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager comes with a handy widget, which shows you the number of active applications right on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you should only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 runs on a single-core 800 MHz processor with the older Adreno 200 GPU and has 512 MB worth of RAM. The device itself feels fairly snappy when navigating the OS, but we never expected it to do wonders in the synthetic benchmark tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack tests pure processing speed and the Galaxy mini 2 handily beats out all of budget-range competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 tests the GPU of the Galaxy mini 2. While 15.4 frames per second are enough to top this chart, they hardly suggest spectacular gaming performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In SunSpider and BrowserMark the mini 2 took the top position by an impressive margin. The results indicate pretty good web browsing performance, especially considering the specifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HD video is a bit too much to ask from the processor, and the poor codec support is another downside of the Qualcomm chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is generally a seamless experience, with the notable exception of flash videos, where there is a significant amount of lag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge your contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information, while the other stores call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only Facebook and LinkedIn contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calling and dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in a separate tab. Smart Dial is enabled for both names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also has a shortcut for sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting or holding the call, or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, while sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 scored Average in our traditional loudspeaker test. The vibration on the other hand is strong, which will alert you in case you don't hear the ringer in a loud environment. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging interface is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly locate a message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts for easier sorting and viewing. Conversation layout is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also onboard here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as XT9. Both are fairly comfortable, although the keys might feel a little cramped in portrait. The landscape keyboard should be good enough. There's handwriting recognition and Swype.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slick gallery and file browser, but no real image editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 uses the standard Android gallery, however a slightly dumbed-down version as it does not include an edit feature. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It can even import the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. Sharing images over Bluetooth, email and MMS is enabled, and so is uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs by sideways swipes. There's an onscreen scrubber, as well as a volume slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful video player, but no AVI support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy mini 2 can handle 3GP and MP4 video files, but not AVI's, which is a major downer. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution. Never mind the higher clock speed, Qualcomm processors aren't famous for wide video codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn't play, but that's overkill on a HVGA display anyway. But you're not limited to the Galaxy mini 2 display. Thanks to DLNA you can view photos and videos on compatible hardware - like TVs or computers with the right software (the latest version of Windows Media player for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be - there almost isn't one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 did quite well in our audio quality test. It's not as good as a Galaxy S III, but we've seen way worse in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy mini 2 show its full potential and achieved some pretty good results. Its intermodulation distortion could be lower and the phone could be a bit louder, but it's still a decent performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of a moderate hike in stereo crosstalk, and some extra intermodulation distortion. None of those readings is bad enough to be alarming though, and the other scores are once again great so the overall performance is quite good actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice 3MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 comes with a 3MP camera and is able to capture photos at a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. The lack of an actual shutter key or a flash of any kind is a clear sign that photography isn't taken too seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the scene and shooting mode buttons, as well as the exposure slider and the settings button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the shots captured with the Galaxy mini 2 is decent for the 3MP league, but that's hardly too great an achievement. Images have a moderate noise levels, and while there's enough resolved detail the colors are off more often than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In certain situations where there was movement at medium range the image would get skewed slightly, but for the most part that was a rare occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 can be compared with other 3MP and higher cameraphones in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording doesn't impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the original Mini, which was capable of QVGA recording at 15fps, the Galaxy mini 2 can shoot 640 x 480 video at 30fps in MP4 format. VGA quality is far from impressive these days, with more and more devices able to do 720p, but at least it's a step above the abysmal QVGA recording of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are smooth but the level of detail isn't impressive. Colors are okay and so is the focus in the video. The Galaxy mini 2 records mono sound with a bitrate of 96Kbps, and we found it to be a little quiet. Check out the sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched VGA@30fps sample (5.8MB) straight from the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Above average connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 has quad-band 3G and GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Bluetooth 3.0 too for fast local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support with a Wi-Fi hotspot option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini 2 also features the ability to read NFC tags. Settings for this can be found in the Tags app, which lets you create and manage your tags.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos in the browser (albeit with a fair amount of choppiness). Flash games ran without a hitch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SNS integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we've seen before - it combines your email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and shows all incoming messages in one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There's filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini 2 also comes with the Google+ and Messenger preloaded, which can take care of all your Google+ needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A plethora of organizational tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app is pretty self-explanatory - it lets you create text memos, complete with SNS integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 has the latest version of the Google Play app store. The new name and icon aside there aren't major changes to the look and feel. In select countries aside from apps you'll also find music, movies and books but this content remains limited so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air for wireless PC connections<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy mini 2 comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer's web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone - from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who's connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Samsung Mini, released almost exactly a year prior to the mini 2, had very few points in its favor and the level of equipment wasn't among them. But it was cheap and it had Android. This made it a good option for anyone looking to see what all this smartphone business was all about, but wasn't ready to sell their firstborn in the process. The mini 2 finds its market niche in the same vicinity as its predecessor, although this time around Samsung have boosted the specs to something more respectable, adding a higher-resolution screen, more storage and RAM, and a faster processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is usually the case when recommending a device which is clearly aimed at the budget market, the most important question is: how budget is budget? Right now, the mini 2 can be had for about ?160 in most markets. While this is fairly cheap, it's not the lowest price we've seen on an Android-powered entry-level device from Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy Pocket costs around ?100, and is a safe bet if you're looking for a new smartphone and low price is your only criteria. The screen has poor resolution and pixel density, making it a bit of a hard sale (not to mention its QVGA video recording at 15fps), but if you want cheap, it's a hard price to beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Pocket S5300</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're comfortable with the mini 2's price range, there are several other offerings to consider. Last year's Samsung Galaxy Gio shares the same screen and general size as the mini 2, and can be had for around ?130. It's upgradeable to the same Android Gingerbread version as the mini 2, and has the same 3 MP camera as well. If video recording is your thing, then the scales tip slightly in favor of the mini 2, as the Gio is only capable of QVGA@15fps. Storage and RAM are also a bit of a factor as well, as the Gio only has 158 MB of internal storage (although Samsung do include a 2 GB SD card in the retail package) and less RAM than the mini 2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC and LG offer a couple of devices which also compete in the budget market. The HTC Explorer and the recently-released LG Optimus L3 are both slightly more vertically compact than the mini 2, although with slightly inferior screens. The L3 has a 240 x 320 pixel display with support for up to 256K colors, and while the Explorer shares the HVGA resolution of the mini 2, it too has only 256K colors. Both devices can be had for around ?120, although each has smaller storage capacity when compared to the mini 2, so you'll probably want to factor in the cost of a microSD card into your purchase as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung has had plenty of practice in perfecting the Gingerbread OS across a wide variety of smartphones, and its experience in optimizing Android 2.3 really shows in how well the processor is able to keep up with the UI. With the exception of the occasional hiccups in web-browsing, the responsiveness of the mini 2 is pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini 2 should be both grateful and wary of the Galaxy Pocket. The Galaxy Minis are no longer at the bottom of the food chain but they had to surrender the "cheapest Android" title as well. The Galaxy Pocket is easily seen from across Dumbphone street, while the mini 2 joins the swelling ranks of affordable droids of which Samsung never seem to get enough. The yellow jacket however, is easy to spot from afar.</paragraph>
