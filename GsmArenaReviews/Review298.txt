			<subsectionTitle>Blind shootout reveal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Spoilers ahead! Voting is now closed, but you can still go to Page 2 and pick your favorites with a mind clear of brand preconceptions and promises. Below the phones behind the letters A, B, C and D are revealed as well as the winners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were a lot of correct guesses in the comments, well done readers! It was the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, which was behind the label 'A', 'B' was the LG V10, 'C' - the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and finally, 'D' - the Samsung Galaxy Note5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#1 and #2 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 (B) scored decisive victories in day time photography, taking 60% of the vote on #1 and 75% on #2. The Samsung Galaxy Note5 (D) placed a distant second with 24% and 13% respectively, almost losing out to the Lumia 950 XL (C) in #2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#3 - Best night time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 (B) adds another prize to its growing collection with an overwhelming 83% of the vote. The other three didn't break 10%. The Galaxy Note5 (D, 9%) and Lumia 950 XL (C, 7%) were again pretty close to each other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#4 - Best day time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 (B) is closing in on a flawless victory, it was even more dominant with 87% of the vote. The Galaxy Note5 (B, 9%) remained stable, while the Lumia 950 XL lost quite a bit of ground.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#5 - Best night time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a surprise upturn the Apple iPhone 6s Plus (A) scores the highest in night time video recording with 46% of the vote. It has a narrow lead over the LG V10 (B, 34%), with the Lumia 950 XL (C) taking 13% and the Note5 (D) taking 7%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We brought back the LG V10 because it performed so well last time, but this time it was even more dominant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, our head-to-head article (to be published very soon) focuses on the other three - the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note5. It will be about more than the camera, examining the screen, the battery life and chipset performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Blind shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: The voting is now closed, check out the results (and the reveal) on Page 1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last week's blind shootout got us in a competitive spirit, so we decided we'd do another one - but a phablet one still. This time, we bring in the Apple iPhone 6s Plus and the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL, while carrying over the LG V10 and Samsung Galaxy Note5 from our previous blind shoot-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: the order of the phones above is not A, B, C and D, that would be too easy. Still, "A" always refers to the same phone, same for the other letters. Also, we shuffled things around, so the Note5 and V10 are not in the same positions as last time. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL has impressive PureView pedigree and features a large 20MP sensor, a wide f/1.9 aperture on its Carl Zeiss lens and optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 6s Plus marks Apple's first bump in resolution since the iPhone 4S and its first 2160p camera too. The 12MP sensor has 1.22µm pixels, the camera also features OIS and a relatively narrow f/2.2 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note5 and LG V10 cameras are fairly similar with 16MP sensors and OIS, but differ in aperture - f/1.8 for the LG (the widest here ) and f/1.9 for the Samsung (matching the Lumia).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've cropped the photos to 4:3 and scaled them so that the field of view matches in all shots. Otherwise wide-angle cameras would be too conspicuous.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#1 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first batch of photos was shot handheld at ground level. Try looking at the text of the STOP sign, the sharpness of the tree branches as well as how the grey building in the background was rendered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote below:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#2 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's another scene, taken from the balcony using a tripod. There're a lot of highlights and shadows in these scene so dynamic range is vital.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best day time photo, round #2, vote below:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#3 - Best night time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Using a tripod again, we snapped a few photos after dusk. Don't forget to look at the individual photos for a better look at how much noise is in each shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we saw last time around, day time excellence doesn't guarantee good performance in the dark. Pick the best night-time shooter below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#4 - Best day time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>These 2160p videos were shot at ground level using a tripod. How much did image quality degrade compared to still shots?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From stills to moving pictures. Keep in mind 2160p video is equivalent to 8MP, that's the full resolution of the previous iPhone models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#5 - Best night time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>2160p videos again, shot after dusk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos in the dark are hard enough, the fast shutter speed required makes videos in the dark even harder. Which phone did best?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will close voting on this blind comparison in a day or two and we'll publish the full resolution shots we used. So stay tuned!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're also working on a head-to-head article featuring the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note5 and we'll post this one later this week as well.</paragraph>
