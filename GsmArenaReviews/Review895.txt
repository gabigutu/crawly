		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a tall task ahead of the Microsoft Surface 2. The first generation of the Microsoft tablet arrived with much fanfare but had little success, and the newcomer has to entice new customers, proving along the way that Redmond can be a factor in the consumer tablet marketplace and, more importantly, that Windows RT has a future as a platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make a case for itself, the Microsoft Surface 2 comes with an OS update. Windows RT 8.1 is a notable improvement over its predecessor, which includes welcome UI tweaks, better integration of Microsoft services, as well as a broader choice of third-party apps compared to a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the updated OS, the Surface 2 comes packed with some seriously capable hardware, including an NVIDIA Tegra 4 SoC, a 10.6" FullHD display, a 5MP camera, and a long list of connectivity and storage expansion options. Here goes its full list of talents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a quick glance, the Microsoft Surface 2 is a worthy successor of the original. It boasts beefed up specs and slightly improved ergonomics, while retaining the same signature design and dimensions, which have become a family staple. The same goes for its additional Touch and Type covers - they offer better experience and ergonomics than their respective predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest question mark hanging upon the Microsoft Surface 2 concerns its OS. Windows RT has been abandoned by most major players in the industry, with Microsoft and Nokia left as the only manufacturers to go forward making devices to boot the OS. As a result, developers aren't exactly gushing over the prospect of creating cool apps for the platform, thus putting its very future in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the matter of the competition which the Microsoft Surface 2 has to face. In addition to a duo of brand new iPad models and a host of premium Android offerings, the tablet has to deal with a few lower-priced Intel-powered tablets running full Windows 8.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will kick off our Surface 2 review with the usual unboxing session, followed by a look at the design and build. Read on to find out what Microsoft's latest and greatest slate looks and feels like in the flesh!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 ships in a relatively modest retail box. Inside, you will find the slate, a charger, as well as some booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Touch or Type cover would have certainly been a welcome sight inside the retail package of the Surface 2. Users who would like to get them, will need to spend an additional $119.99 on the Touch cover, and $129.99 for the Type cover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Type Cover 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alongside the Surface 2, we also got to test out the optional Type Cover 2. The optional accessory offers a full-blown backlit keyboard / magnetic screen cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard attaches firmly to the Surface 2 via a magnetic mechanism on the tablet's bottom. That, combined with the two-stage kickstand, transforms the slate into a lightweight laptop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Type Cover 2 keys are well-proportioned and offer great tactile feel. The touchpad on the other hand, is nowhere nearly as good, though considering the touchscreen on hand, we don't think it will see much action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our biggest complaint about the Type Cover 2 is related to its price. At $129.99, it adds significantly to the bottom line of the Surface 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We reckon that the Type Cover 2 is more capable than its Touch Cover 2 sibling and therefore worth the extra $10 in retail pricing. It offers actual keys, as opposed to the Touch Cover 2, thus requiring practically no time to get used to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing revolutionary about the design of the Microsoft Surface 2. Save for the gray color scheme, which accentuates its body's magnesium finish, the tablet looks exactly the same as its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were split in our feelings towards the design of the Microsoft Surface 2. While it is undoubtedly handsome, we do believe that even a mildly refreshed look would make the slate attract more attention. Owners of the first generation would have been particularly thankful for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We admit, the build quality of the Microsoft Surface 2 is nothing short of exceptional. The tablet is extremely well put together using metal for the body and Corning Gorilla Glass for protection of the screen. It looks and feels ready to tackle plenty of daily use and abuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet's measures are 274.6 x 172.5 x 8.9 mm, while its weight tips the scale at the rather hefty 675.9 grams. The aforementioned numbers make the tablet one of the bulkiest 10" offerings around, especially when compared to the iPad Air and the latest Android tablets. The screen bezel is simply enormous by today's high-end standards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 sports a 10.6" ClearType display of FullHD resolution (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) and pixel density of 208ppi. The screen is a massive improvement over the unit of last year's Surface RT in terms of resolution, thus decidedly better to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast and viewing angles of the screen are quite good, as is its outdoor visibility. In short, the display of the Microsoft Surface 2 is a fine unit to live with on a daily basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One shortcoming of the device's display that we couldn't overlook is its relatively low resolution for a top-end tablet. The iPad Air and the latest crop of high-end Android tablets offer a lot more pixels for the money, thus significantly better image sharpness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the front-facing camera, an ambient light sensor, and a microphone reside. Below the screen, there's nothing but the capacitive Windows home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the tablet, you will find one of the stereo speakers, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm audio jack, as well as the latch for opening the kickstand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the slate is just as busy. It hosts the other stereo speaker, as well as a mini HDMI port, full USB port, and the tablet's proprietary charging port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key is the only thing you will find on the top of the tablet. The keyboard connector sits alone at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the tablet is home to the 5MP camera and an additional microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two-stage kickstand is there too, sporting a large Surface sign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is located underneath the kickstand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, Microsoft is coy about the exact battery capacity of the Surface 2. The manufacturer promises up to 10 hours of video playback time and 7-15 days of standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the tablet's battery through its paces and here is what it had to offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its solid build quality and high-end finish, the Microsoft Surface 2 offers a pleasant tactile feel when handled. However, the slate is not the most comfortable to hold, particularly in portrait mode. This is due to its prominent edges - they look good, but are the main reason for the questionable ergonomics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Microsoft Surface 2 deserves nothing but high marks for its build quality and battery life. Its design could have certainly used a refresh though - the tablet doesn't feel new at first glance. The tablet-only ergonomics are also a little iffy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the Windows RT 8.1 experience which the Surface 2 delivers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows 8.1 RT at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows RT is a relatively new OS - it's only been around for an year now and it is different from both the regular Windows and the Windows Phone OS you may have seen elsewhere. RT (short for Runtime) is made to run on ARM processors (like the ones in today's smartphones and tablets) instead on the regular Intel and AMD processors that we use in our computers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows RT relies only on the Windows Store for apps and you can't install any legacy software. None of your Windows Vista/7/8 apps are directly available on Windows RT, unless their developers release a compatible version and Microsoft claims that making one is pretty easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important difference is that Windows RT is only available pre-installed on devices and it's not available directly to end users - only OEMs have access to it. After the initial enthusiasm, the OEMs in question have started moving away from the platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right before the Surface 2 was announced, there were even rumors that Microsoft will be scrapping the project altogether. So far (November 2013), there is no official announcement on the matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exact version that the Microsoft Surface 2 boots is actually Windows 8.1 RT. The latest version of the ARM-based OS is not a major update, though it still brings some welcome changes to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the Surface 2 with Windows 8.1 RT in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Start menu is comprised of live tiles just like on Windows Phone. The difference is that the live tile grid is scrollable horizontally rather than vertically, which makes sense given the default orientation of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch gesture on the screen shrinks the grid of tiles, which is particularly handy if you've got a lot of tiles and you are starting to get lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe from the top or bottom of the main screen reveals the context menu. This gesture is enabled in every app, as well as on the Start screen. When in the latter, it reveals the "Customize" menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To select a tile you need to do a vertical swipe on it - mass selection for unpinning and uninstalling is also available. This works on all sorts of files in Start - pictures, documents, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live tiles can be resized just like in Windows Phone - there are four sizes available now as opposed to three in Windows 8 RT. An option to turn live tiles off is also available. Some tiles are nothing more than static icons even after you make them bigger but others (like Calendar) help bring more information right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up from the Start menu reveals the full list of installed apps. A pinch gesture reveals an alphabetical grid which lets you quickly search the list of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is done by swiping from the left edge of the screen towards the center. There's an alternate way of doing this - a short swipe from the left edge of the screen and then quickly back displays a vertical thumbnail grid of the recent apps. If you're using a conventional keyboard with your Windows 8.1 RT, a simple Alt+Tab gets the job done just like it has for ages now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Split screen mode has been greatly revamped in Windows 8.1 RT. It now allows users to view apps side by side in equally-sized windows, as opposed to a large and a small one in the previous version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Charms menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Charms menu is available across the OS. It's accessible via a swipe from the right edge of the screen and gives access to search, share, Start, devices and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Devices detects every device in your network's Home/Workgroup - if you're logged on to one that is. You can send content to these devices through this menu. Share does the same, but using different apps to share depending on the type of content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu gives you quick options for Wireless, sound, screen, notifications, power and keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are sliders to adjust the brightness and volume of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also select which keyboard to use and choose to restart, shut down or sleep using the quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a shortcut to the detailed settings menu here. From there you can personalize the look of Windows 8.1 RT. You can choose lockscreen wallpaper, select apps that can run in the background and show notifications or detailed statuses on the lockscreen - for instance the Calendar will display your upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next option is the Start screen. You can choose a color scheme and background. There are many options in every color you can think of but you can't use your own picture as wallpaper - you have to select one of the preinstalled ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to change your account photo as well. It is done by tapping on the top right corner where the user account information is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple users on Windows 8.1 RT, just like you can in Windows 8. Users can have their own tile grid, apps, preferences, etc. If you have more than one Windows 8 or RT device you can enable settings sync between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be disabled on the lockscreen altogether and you can switch off the sounds. You can also configure which apps can push notifications to your lockscreen. However you cannot control the way notifications are presented, only switch them on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can choose which apps to use while searching. There's the handy option to delete the search history too. Sharing settings are very limited. Currently you can only share via Mail, People and SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general settings handle time, spelling, screen automatic brightness, language options, reinstall Windows, etc. The Devices section handles the PCs and devices in a Wi-Fi Home/Workgroup. You can add new and connect with existing ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 8.1 RT lets you choose which settings you wish to sync with SkyDrive or disable the feature. Your personalization, passwords, app, browser settings and more can be synced between your PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modern UI is really fluid and responsive. All UI transitions and animations are buttery-smooth and we didn't notice any lag. This is hardly a surprise, as the NVIDIA Tegra SoC is one of the speedier around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limited desktop functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, Windows 8.1 RT features desktop mode. The biggest change compared to the previous version is the presence of a start button. The latter takes you to the Start menu - it doesn't act like a Windows Start button of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important feature of the classical desktop is that it allows you to access the file system on your Surface tablet. The internal storage and every additional drive connected to the Surface are displayed here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are organized just like on any computer running Windows 7 or 8. You can search folders, jump straight to the Desktop, Libraries, Homegroup, Computer and Network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 comes with a USB 3.0 port and a microSD card slot. Whenever a USB flash drive is plugged into the Surface you get prompted to choose what to do. Autoplay includes the option to import content and open the folder to view files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface 2 had no trouble with any file we threw at it. DivX, XviD, avi, mp4, mov and MKV movies played without a hassle, all the way up to 1080p. Photos weren't a problem either and the same goes for PDFs and docs - none of those actually required us to install any kind of third party software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While in Desktop mode, you are free to copy, cut and paste files all across the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although you cannot install legacy apps on Windows 8.1 RT, like you would on any x86 or x64 version of Windows, there are a couple of familiar faces present that will make you feel at home. Notepad, Calculator, Command prompt and Paint are all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the same goes for the Control panel. You can uninstall apps, manage accounts, time and language options, view hardware information, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When launched, the task manager shows you the currently running apps with the option to stop them or you could request to see more details. The latter displays a color-coded grid of your running apps with a per-app breakdown of CPU, RAM, Disk and Network usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a performance tab that lets you examine the CPU load over time as well as the load on RAM, storage, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App History shows how much system resources your apps have used since the tablet has been active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People is in charge of contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Windows 8.1 RT stores all of your contact information, rounded up from all of the accounts you sync with. You can view contacts from your Microsoft account, Facebook, Hotmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's New tab also made the cross from Windows Phone - it shows new events from all contacts in social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People app will even let you call contacts' phones from the Surface 2. It uses Skype to make the call, which requires a subscription or Skype credits. The slate comes with a year worth of free Skype calls to sixty destinations worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter) and view your online albums.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Skype handled instant messaging duties<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the previous version, Windows 8.1 RT comes without a dedicated messenger app. Those duties are now handled by the Skype app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. Unfortunately, there is no haptic feedback (vibration) and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout is tailored for the 16:9 aspect of the Surface screen. The keyboard comes in two modes - standard and split screen, which divides the QWERTY in two halves, docked on either side of the screen with a number pad in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's handwriting recognition on Windows 8.1 RT. It works really well and, given the ample screen size, is very comfortable to use even with fingers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email app is divided into three screen panes. On the left you get the folder view, in the middle is the conversation view, while the currently selected email is displayed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up any account, including Hotmail, Google, Yahoo or your own. The app supports exchange activesync, IMAP and POP accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual messages and move them, mark as read or unread and even pin them to the start menu. You can send emails from whichever account you choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case, the "regular" email client is a tad too plain for you, Windows 8.1 RT has Outlook 2013 on board. Available in desktop only mode, it offers an old-school UI and an overwhelming amount of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up an email address on Outlook 2013 however is ridiculously easy. All you need to do is type in the email address and the password. The function works even with IMAP accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app handles, well, photos on Windows 8.1 RT. It's similar to what you'll find on Windows Phone, and comes with a clean, easy to navigate interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos app is divided into the Pictures library, SkyDrive, Flickr and Devices where you'll see the public photos shared by the people in your Homegroup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures in an album will be displayed in a side-scrollable horizontal grid. By default, pictures are displayed in large thumbnails but you can opt for a more compressed grid by pinching to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos in a slideshow or set the picture you're browsing as a lockscreen wallpaper, app tile or app background. Windows 8.1 RT also allows images to be opened in desktop mode. The latter includes Windows Photo Viewer, as well as the Paint editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark multiple photos in an album, which only lets you start a slideshow with them. You copy and cut pictures from the Photos app, as well as create new folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface is a decent device for browsing photos - the 10.6" screen is big enough and offers good colors and high resolution. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio of the screen doesn't get along too well with 4:3 photos, so you are getting lots of letterboxing or cropping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox is in charge of music and videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music and the video player of Windows 8.1 RT are handled by two separate apps powered by Xbox. Both are pinned to the Start menu once you power up the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xbox music has been significantly revamped compared to last version. It puts the user's own music collection, the music store, as well as an online radio under the same roof. A search bar tops all three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the Xbox music app takes the user to his/hers own music collection. Immediately below is the Xbox radio streaming service - it requires a premium pass for ad-free listening and looks like a good alternative to Pandora. The Xbox music store is now listed under an Explore section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now playing shows the artist and name of the song along with an overview with Album name, Genre, etc. The interface offers animated album art, pause/play and skip controls. A swipe from the top or bottom edge of the screen reveals the music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xbox Video greets you with featured movies and TV shows. User's own videos are all the way on the left. A search button can be found on the top right side. It works for both the user's content, as well as the one sold in the Xbox store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching videos on the Surface 2 is a real pleasure, thanks to the kickstand and 10.6" 1080p screen. The context menu offers repeat, previous, play/pause, next, and play to which lets you wirelessly stream the video to any DLNA-enabled device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Games is the place to go for downloading games on the Surface 2. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. Featured games will greet you at startup, in the same fashion as the video section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The store shows Windows games, divided into new releases and genres. Each game has its own page complete with an overview and the option to buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has improved a good deal in terms of available gaming titles for Windows 8.1 RT. Halo Spartan Assault is undoubtedly the most popular of the pack - it is exclusive to Windows devices for now (coming soon to Xbox 360 and Xbox One).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing a game on the Surface 2 is a breeze. The Tegra 4 chipset is top notch, so there were no issues whatsoever performance-wise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5MP main camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 features a 5MP main camera and a 3.5MP front-facing unit. Both snappers are a serious improvement over the duo of 1.2MP units featured in the first generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is very simple. There are three buttons on the left side - one for taking photos, one for capturing video, and a third one for panoramas. Photos can also be captured by simply tapping on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up in the camera app reveals more options. They include changing the front and back camera, activating a timer, and adjusting exposure and focus. The camera roll access button is also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 is certainly not a proper photography tool, so we didn't expect much in terms of photo image quality and we were quite right. Photos come out with pleasing colors and there is not much noise (at least not in good light) but they are somewhat soft, probably due to poor camera optics than anything else.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both cameras of the Microsoft Surface 2 are capable of capturing 1080p video. The samples we took with the camera on the back came out really nice. Unlike the still photos, there is plenty of details in videos and they are really smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video bitrate is 21Mbps, which is plenty. The only downside is that videos are recorded with mono audio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet explorer has two faces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows 8.1 RT comes with two browsers preinstalled and offers no other options for now. Delivered with the 8.1update, Internet Explorer 11 handles the web and comes in two forms - one in the Modern UI with a touch-centric interface and another one in the more conventional Desktop version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Modern view, IE 11 runs in full screen by default. A swipe from the bottom or top edge of the screen reveals the opened tabs on the bottom. It offers a new tab option, a new private tab, and reopen a closed one. At the bottom is a back button, the unified search/URL bar and options to refresh, pin the current page to start, forward and an extra menu with find on page, view on desktop and "get app for this site" options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing pages can be done via the Charms menu. Pages can be shared over Mail or the People app, meaning Facebook or Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, if you want to change preferences or settings you can only do so in desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 in desktop mode features a unified URL and search bar, the opened tabs and three virtual buttons for home, bookmark and settings. Opening up a new tab prompts a thumbnail collection of recently opened tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 is fully Flash-enabled. Watching videos inline is done exactly as you would on any desktop PC. We didn't experience any problems with videos even at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Options is well-known IE setting. You can set a home page, choose the level of security, privacy, control the intern content connections, etc. There's an option to open links directly from Internet Explorer in Modern or Desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer has come a long way and isn't the once clustered, slow browser many people used only for downloading Firefox and Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface did a phenomenal job in the JavaScript benchmark SunSpider. Its 405 ms score bested even the latest iPad family achievements.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps, Windows Store, SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows 8.1 RT is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications for Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps come in two styles - aerial view and map view. In aerial, you get satellite imagery, which is pretty clear but there's no Bird's eye or Streetside options in the app, which we find particularly strange given their presence in the web version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout didn't make its way to Windows 8.1 RT - on Windows Phone it's the app that provides detailed information on places of interest around you - restaurants, shops, landmarks, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there is navigation on the Microsoft Surface, it lacks voice guidance and we can't see many people using the Surface as a navigation tool. Traffic information is available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store is the only place you can find apps for Windows 8.1 RT. Compared to last year, the number of available apps has grown significantly, thus improving one of the OS's weakest points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store starts off with featured apps. Swiping to the right reveals recommended apps, trending ones, and top picks. The last two sections show top paid and top free apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has gone through great lengths to address the lack of popular apps for Windows 8.1 RT. Compared to last year, there are a lot more of the popular app titles available here, including Dropbox, Flipboard, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some glaring omissions though. They include YouTube and alternative web browsers other than Internet Explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Installing an app is easy - just go to the app and hit Install. You can check the download progress and a new tile being created in the start menu automatically. After an app has been installed you get a notification in the top right corner of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Windows Store shows a great improvement compared to the work in progress it was last year. We reckon that Microsoft can further help its cause by charging for the same available paid apps the same amounts Apple and Google do. On some occasions, the price differences were quite substantial.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive handles your personalization, app settings, passwords, language preferences, Office documents and much more. You can upload just about anything to SkyDrive and thus have it available across all of your Windows-powered handheld devices or PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app displays different categories for the uploaded content - Documents, Mobile uploads, camera roll, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can upload, create a folder or select multiple folders. You can upload multiple items at once. The upload menu gives you quick access to the most common apps from which users will upload - Photos, Desktop, Computer, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app shows photos from your SkyDrive account and Office has the feature to automatically save documents to the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, Windows 8.1 RT is doing very well to provide users with this easy back up option in case things go south and you need to reset your device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student Edition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed Office 2013 Home and Student edition gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Microsoft decided not to optimize the interface of either app to suit the Modern UI and instead just ported the x86 versions to the ARM platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't really blame them for doing so, as the office applications are bound to be used with a keyboard and a mouse/trackpad anyway. Plus, Office isn't the easiest of apps to master, which means that a general design overhaul might have put off frequent users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the functionality is there and, if you mainly use your PC for document editing, Windows 8.1 RT can easily pass as your daily driver. No matter whether you mean to create or edit documents, Windows 8.1 RT has got you covered. There's an easy to follow step by step tutorial for each Office application in case you're new to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Word 2013 features the entire package - text formatting, headings, track changes, page layout, you name it. Windows 8.1 RT has an impressively ample selection of fonts, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excel 2013 is there for your spreadsheet needs. Formulas and calculation are all supported, and so are cell formatting options. You'd be hard-pressed to find a difference between Excel on your PC and the one on Windows 8.1 RT.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating PowerPoint presentations on the Microsoft Surface is as easy as on PC. You can choose between countless transition effects, animations and sounds. A presentation can be previewed and imported, and an existing file can be edited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote 2013 is your one-stop app for taking and organizing notes on Windows 8.1 RT. The app has an interface similar to Word, but with less options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have multiple Notebooks in OneNote and creating one is done through a drop-down menu. You can choose the name of the Notebook and the color it shows up in, as well as whether to save it locally or in SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive can sync all of your Office 2013 documents between devices. All you need is your Microsoft ID. It's very convenient and sync is instantaneous. Your documents are safe in the cloud in case your PC needs a reset or is broken or lost.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app on Windows 8.1 RT is well familiar - it looks identical to the one on Windows Phone. You can set it to show events in Day, Week or Month view. There is no Agenda view so you cannot see a list of your upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Day and Week view are sorted by hours so you would need to scroll up or down, depending on the specific time of the event. Events are color coded depending on the type of calendar (your own, Birthdays, Holidays, etc.) and you can change colors to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting an event is simple and straightforward. Thanks to the large screen you see all of the information without the need for endless scrolling. The Calendar syncs with Hotmail, Google and Outlook. Facebook is strangely missing here so all of your Facebook buddies birthdays will need to be manually entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those users who have their mind on productivity can count on the superb organizing skulls of Outlook 2013. The app is only available in classic desktop mode like the rest of the Windows RT 8.1 office suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the organizing skills of Windows 8.1 RT have grown massively thanks to the presence of Outlook 2013. The latter was a glaring omission in the office suite of the OS's previous version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Deeply integrated Bing services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bing has seen a much deeper integration in Windows RT 8.1. Bing search is now accessed by a simple swiping gesture from the right side of the tablet's display. It gives you the option to search on the tablet alone, its settings, or the web. The latter can be specified for only images or videos. By default, Bing performs a search on both the tablet and online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing News shows you trending topics of the day from featured news sites. You can select to view content from a number of news sources, neatly organized by category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Articles appear in magazine-like style. You can choose between two different font styles, adjust the font size and toggle articles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Sport works the same way only it's focused on sporting news only. There's a spotlight with the story of the day, a top stories grid, the local sports schedule and, finally, the option to choose favorite teams you'd like to follow closely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an All Sports section which lets you choose a sport or league to check out but the choice is rather limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Finance is a mixture of financial news, stocks, currencies and commodities. You can create your own watch list of companies whose stock prices you like to keep track of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Travel is a great application filled with interesting facts, 360 degree panoramas of popular places around the world and a rich database covering many destinations around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app shows a featured destination on the main page each day, followed by a grid of the most popular destinations in the app. There's a nifty option to search for flights or hotels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Weather is the go-to app for daily forecasts. Opening up the app reveals the weather conditions in your current location (or a preset one) along with an hourly forecast, map view of temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, etc. in your region and nation-wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose to be informed for as many locations as you like. Finally there's a World Weather view, which offers information about major cities in the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the different dimensions of user experience the Microsoft Surface 2 offers, we found it hard to make a definite judgment - a classic case of perception skewed by perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewed in isolation, the Microsoft Surface 2 is a mighty good tablet. It's properly powered, exceptionally well built, and with rich productivity and multimedia capability available right out of the box. It is also handsome to look at, even if a bit long in the tooth already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation of the Windows RT tablet also makes a strong case for itself for users already invested in the Windows RT ecosystem, looking to upgrade their first generation tablet. The newcomer offers an improvement in every aspect, except for exterior design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things take a downturn for the Surface 2 when it gets compared to the iOS and Android competition. The recently launched iPad Air and the high-end Android tablets have higher-resolution displays, and a much better optimized tablet experience. They also offer a significantly wider app selection to users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the Intel-based Windows 8.1 competition. The latest generation Intel Bay Trail tablets (the ones based on chipsets such as the quad-core Intel Atom Z3xxx) offer full Windows for less money than the Surface 2, thus seriously questioning its RT credentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 is priced at $449 for a version with 32GB of built-in memory. Touch 2 and Type 2 covers are priced at $119.99 and $129.99 respectively - we strongly suggest that you budget for either one if considering the tablet - they do make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of alternatives to the Surface 2, sitting in its price range. Here go some of the ones worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air is arguably the best full size tablet available at the moment. It offers higher screen resolution than the Surface 2, as well as superb design and ergonomics. To cap things off, Cupertino's entry offers close to half a million apps optimized for tablet use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air is priced at $599 for a 32GB version - only slightly more than the Surface 2. Those not heavily invested in the Windows RT ecosystem, should give the tablet a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) and the ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T are Android realm's heavy hitters at the moment. Both slates offer significantly higher-resolution displays when compared to the Surface 2, in addition to a better established tablet OS with a fine integration of Google's many services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) ? Asus Transformer Pad TF701T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) is priced at $549, while the ASUS goes head to head with the Surface 2 at $449. As expected from an ASUS slate, the TF701T also offers a seriously good keyboard dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Memo Pad FHD10 offers a 1080p display, dual-core Intel Atom CPU, and Android on a budget. It is priced at $299, thus leaving users with plenty of cash left to buy the optional keyboard cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 is a direct Surface 2 competitor - the only other current gen tablet to run Win 8 RT. The Finnish device offers better tablet-only ergonomics, LTE connectivity, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 SoC to go with its Windows 8.1 RT OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 2520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 2520 is priced at $499 unsubsidized. AT&amp;T however, offers the slate at $199 for users who opt for it alongside a Nokia Lumia 2520 or 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the latest Intel Bay Trail competition with full Windows 8.1 on board. Two of its most prominent members include the recently launched HP Omni 10 and ASUS T100. The HP Omni 10 flaunts a 1080p display, while the ASUS tablet makes up for the lack thereof with a bundled keyboard dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the HP Omni 10 and ASUS T100 are priced at $399.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year ago when we first met the Microsoft Surface RT, we reckoned that the device showed promise, despite not feeling like a complete package at the time. The Windows RT OS was the reason why we had that feeling - it had just launched and it was still a work in progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year and an OS update later, we still have the same feeling. The Microsoft Surface 2 is a fine piece of hardware, held back by an OS which is stuck in no man's land between Windows Phone and full-blown Windows 8.1 territory. Intel Bay Trail powered tablets manage the same battery life so it's understandable that Microsoft's hardware partners have slowly quit making Windows RT hardware altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things can be very different for the tablet, should Microsoft marry its ARM hardware with the constantly growing Windows Phone 8 library of apps. Until then, the Surface 2 is bound to remain a niche product - full of character but not quite hitting the bar yet set by Google and Apple tablets.</paragraph>
