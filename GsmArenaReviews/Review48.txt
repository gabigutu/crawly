			<paragraph>Android devices come from all walks of life but rarely do they carry as much baggage as the MILESTONE. Motorola seem to be betting the farm with the MILESTONE and the warm reception it?s getting must leave them breathing a sigh of relief. Catching the Android wave may?ve seemed like the last available move but a device like the MILESTONE makes turning the tide much more likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Motorola are back with a bang and the MILESTONE is one of the best spec?d phones to ever run Android. The Google Nexus One is supposed to instill fear in nearly every touchscreen device out there but the Moto Droid must be positioned well enough by now to withstand the attack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s hardly anything missing on the Motorola MILESTONE spec sheet so we should be ready for an exciting ride. The test-drive got us impressed: at the end of our preview we felt positive about the MILESTONE prospects. So now, the Moto DROID has a full review ahead to build on that good impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the rate of its sales, the handset is doing well from a user point of view too. Yet, a short-lived success is just not good enough for Motorola: the company doesn?t have the resources to come up with an equally talented successor as quick as some of the competitors. So, the MILESTONE needs to stick around the top of the sales charts for at least a few months to give Motorola some breathing space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEXT by the way did reasonably well in scouting out the territory but it now falls upon the MILESTONE to carry the offensive through. Proper backup is still to come so it will have to fight all by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll follow in its footsteps and ? as the tradition goes ? we continue with the hardware and ergonomics right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Reasonable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola MILESTONE comes in a plain box and there isn?t a whole load of interesting stuff inside but all the basics are covered. The mandatory - for the Android breed - microSD memory card is 8GB, which is probably more than most users will ever need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a one-piece handsfree, which doesn?t exactly ooze quality but does the job. Audiophiles will perhaps choose to replace the headphones of course but will have to sacrifice the remote functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB cable is supplied in the box too so you won?t have to look for one yourselves. We wouldn?t give any bonus points to Motorola for it however as its omission would have been ridiculous for an expensive smartphone such as the MILESTONE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final things in the box are a charger, a CD with computer sync software and of course a quick start guide.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola MILESTONE 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 115.8 x 60 x 13.7 mm the Motorola MILESTONE is obviously no midget but you can?t really expect anything less given the side-sliding QWERTY keyboard and such a huge screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola were obviously keen to have their own interpretation of the trademark Android chin. The slider doesn?t completely cover the lower part of the handset, accounting for the asymmetrical line. However, we feel that the whole thing is a lot more refined and understated than the chin on the G1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We could have really done without the D-pad on the QWERTY keyboard too, but we doubt fixing either of those would have made too much of a difference, so it?s hair-splitting really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE weight of 165 grams is also about what you would expect of such a handset. In fact, bearing in mind the metallic body we like so much, we wouldn?t have been too fussed if it was a few grams heavier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A marvelous display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are rather pleased with the design of the Motorola MILESTONE. The handset feels rock solid and the rubbery rear provides a nice grip, in addition to looking quite attractive. Of course, that 3.7" touchscreen at the front doesn?t look at all bad either. The high-res capacitive display makes us purr with delight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The subtle chin of the MILESTONE is perhaps paying tribute to the first of the Androids but is a questionable design solution nonetheless. It?s not about looks ? it actually makes access to the main on-screen controls a bit harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.7-inch display dominates the MILESTONE front when the slider is closed. The capacitive touchscreen has the highest resolution currently available on the market - 854 x 480 pixels. Its image quality is also great with deep blacks (although no AMOLED deep) and high maximum brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Motorola MILESTONE is the first handset to run on Android 2.0, it enjoys 16M-color support and no color banding issues. The 65K-color limitation is taking the fun out of the other Android displays (the XPERIA X10 probably suffering the most) and it's nice of the Open Handset Alliance to have solved that issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the display is top notch but that is to be expected in a capacitive unit. Since there is no need to apply pressure, even the lightest of touches from your (bare!) fingers will do. Gloves and long nails are a no-go with the MILESTONE but that is the price you usually have to pay to get this kind of touchscreen experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also quite pleased with the sunlight legibility of the MILESTONE. It enjoys near iPhone-grade usability out in the open.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the four touch-sensitive controls, typical for the Android platform. The four keys are Back, Menu, Home and Search. They're haptic enabled and very sensitive, so the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Motorola MILESTONE is pretty bare, the microUSB port being the only element there. There is no protective cap over it to prevent dust and dirt from accumulating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right are the camera key and the volume rocker. The camera key is perfect in size and tactility but the volume rocker is a bit too flat and hard to press. This is not something to worry about though, considering that it isn't the most frequently used control anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jumping to the top we find the power/screen-lock key and the 3.5 mm audio jack. Again the aperture isn?t covered in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals the four-row QWERTY keyboard and the D-pad. Having a D-pad here and a Menu key means that in most scenarios you can operate the device even without the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard itself is really comfortable with the keys large and tactile enough to allow quite quick typing. Frankly, we feel it would have been even better without the D-pad but there is a decent amount of space anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inconvenience rendered by the four-row layout is that each key needs to accommodate two different characters. Yet, with the two available Alt keys, there's always one right under a finger so no biggie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Motorola MILESTONE features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the dual-LED flash. The loudspeaker grill is also here, right below the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the cover reveals the 1400 mAh Li-Ion BP6X battery. Quoted at 350 hours of standby time or 6 hours and a half of talk time it certainly sounds like a decent performer. It managed to get us through 2 full days of some quite extensive usage (25 minutes of calls, 50 minutes of web browsing through Wi-Fi and an hour of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also here but unfortunately it isn't hot-swappable. That means that you will have to power off your MILESTONE each time you change cards. On a positive note, it has no trouble handling 16GB cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Motorola MILESTONE is excellent and the handset's body looks quite durable. The abundance of metal certainly conveys the impression of a portfolio-leading device that?s built to last.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android turns 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android OS is no longer breaking news but the Motorola MILESTONE is the first device to ship with the latest 2.0 version. So, it has a great chance to offer quite a few software advantages over its market rivals. The 2.0 update will eventually make its way to more devices of course but time works in the MILESTONE's favor right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new version of the "Google OS" brings many new features and a whole new set of APIs to allow even more useful apps to flood the Google Market. The web browser and the camera have been updated, along with the messaging department, the phonebook, calendar and the virtual keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the general user interface hasn't undergone any major changes. The MotoBLUR interface that was developed for the Motorola CLIQ (or DEXT if you prefer) is nowhere to be seen on our unit but it will perhaps be ported via a software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the cornerstone of the Android UI. Giving you three screen panes worth of space (by default), it helps you put up front all the items you need most and use most frequently. And there are plenty of things that can go up there. You have shortcuts to applications of your choice, then folders and, finally, widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders can help you keep the shortcuts organized but you can't put folders within folders. Still, they can be used for a few quick tricks ? like faking a quick-dial contact list. A contact's photo serves as a dial shortcut so all you have to do is put a bunch of them in a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s nothing too special about that ? it's when live folders come into play that it gets exciting. The main difference to ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All sorts of lists can go into Live folders. For example, you can have a folder that contains all the tweets from a contact, or an RSS feed, or maybe even a folder with all the good restaurants within walking distance from a given location. The preinstalled Live folders are "Contacts with phone numbers" and "Starred contacts". Naturally, they are filled with your Gmail contacts that either have phone numbers or are starred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other inhabitants of the Android homescreen are the widgets. There are three new preinstalled widgets that come with the Android v2.0 - a corporate calendar (the one synced with your Exchange account), the Weather widget and the Power control widget (a handy connectivity manger for your desktop). The power control was known as Switchers on the Galaxy so it's not really new but they added a display backlighting control to it so it counts here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional search widget got an update too and now shows suggestions as you type, just like the Google homepage. It searches local files or gives you a shortcut to initiate a web search, which is a really neat solution. You can also make use of voice searches just like with Google's iPhone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the default homescreen is not much to your liking there are already several alternatives available at the Google Market. They each give you a few different organizing options and a bigger number of screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major advantage of Android is the notification area. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so called notifications area. Tapping on one of the listed notifications takes a context relevant action - for instance, a tap on a notification of a successful installation would launch that application; a finished download notification will open the file and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can pull the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it doesn't need your immediate attention you can let it roll back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the MILESTONE you can press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. The "task switcher" is not really a task switcher, nor is it a task manager. In fact, Android automatically opens and closes applications. When resources start to run out, it might close a currently inactive app but it will restore it back to just how you left it. It's more like the system puts the app to hibernation instead of closing it. Still, the task switcher is useful as it gives you access to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Already feeling quite snappy on the 528 MHz Qualcomm CPUs, Android works like a charm on the Cortex-A8 processor of the MILESTONE. The developers did a really good job of solving the performance issues on all devices since ver. 1.5 but now that they have more powerful hardware at hand, things feel even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a short video demo of the Motorola MILESTONE so you can see that for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-equipped phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.0 has introduced support for quick contacts. That means you can put a contact photo in the phonebook and use it to call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade brought by the new version is the support for multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add an IM nickname to the contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details are displayed in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contact listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the one for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any part of the image you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy - just hit the search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony doing good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The sound is loud enough so you don?t need to always set the volume to maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the MILESTONE, just like the rest of the Android crew (except for the HTC Hero) doesn?t feature smart dialing. This might not be too bad for the full-touch phones but with a hardware keyboard to hand, it?s a real pity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. You can easily search them by flick scrolling. Voice dialing is not available though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the Motorola MILESTONE automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold in next to your ear for a call. There is no chance of ever hitting an on-screen button with your cheek on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola MILESTONE. We weren't overwhelmed but the MILESTONE still snatched a good score, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging monster<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novelty, brought by the MILESTONE is the new option that allows you to preset the number of messages recorded in each thread. Once that number is exceeded the oldest message gets deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool new extra is the search functionality that allows you to quickly find a specific message among all your saved SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since the text box with the message still occupies a very small part of the screen giving you quite a small part of the text to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The list of recipients is maintained in a "Name and Number" format, which is a welcome improvement over version 1.0, which added only the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. The "undelivered messages" section however has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature introduced by Android 2.0 is the common inbox, which combines all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. There is also exchange support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of both the Gmail and the generic Email apps has been slighly polished with several icons in the menus undergoing a change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally the way to go when entering text with the Motorola MILESTONE is the hardware QWERTY keyboard. Yet if you don?t feel like sliding the handset open each time you should know that Android 2.0 comes with an improved on-screen keyboard with better layout to minimize typos and improve typing speed. Also thanks to the framework's multi-touch support you can be sure key presses won?t be missed while typing rapidly with two fingers.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There?s more to be demanded from the gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos located in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 2.0 of the Motorola MILESTONE brings in a new view mode, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the gallery supports gesture controls like changing images or panning with finger swipes so you can altenate images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left ot to the right when looking at a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch-zooming is also available here thanks to the MILESTONE multi-touch support. There is no double tap zooming however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strange bug of the gallery we noticed is its inability to zoom to 100% for some unknown reason. That can make you think that you photos lack detail when you look at them on the handset but transfering them to a computer reveals the truth. You don't see the real image in the gallery but a downsized version instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side there are two important upgrades brought by the new OS version. You have the multiple marking that allows mass cut/copy/delete and Bluetooth file transfers from the gallery. None of those is groundbreaking to the mobile phones world in general but they are both huge improvements for Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is nothing to write home about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Getting videos to play on Android turned out to be a pretty hard task. In the beginning there was no video player at all and you had to rely on silly hacks to view 3gp files via email. Then came the HTC Magic which could play videos from the gallery but had no dedicated application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess now that since we finally have a real video player, it?s time to start wondering when they will actually turn it into something worth using. The video player itself is as simple and limited as it could possibly be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You just hit the video player icon you get a list of all videos available on the phone. And the controls while playing a video boil down to play/pause, next and previous buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codecs support is also pretty limited with DivX and XviD nowhere to be seen. H.264 is as good as you are gonna get, but at least those ran okay with no hiccups. Still, if you are willing to spend some time converting your videos you might actually find the Milestone?s giant display pretty great for watching videos. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that such a powerful device can?t run unconverted video and has such a limited codec playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player needs an update too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the music player saw no updates in Android 2.0. Don?t get us wrong, the Motorola MILESTONE is not too bad at managing your audio files but there?s definitely room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the music player has four large buttons, which offer the four main ways to search in your music collection - by artist, album, song or choose one of the playlists you've created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the music player hasn't changed much. It has that great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song in YouTube or through Google search by holding down a finger on a song. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabetical slider, which appears on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. There are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Motorola MILESTONE is somewhat of a letdown, considering the price tag. It?s not that it has any great flaws but it achieved average or even slightly worse than average on most readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excellent frequency response is probably the best thing about the MILESTONE output. Almost perfect throughout the range it is one of the best we have ever seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are seriously short of impressive and so the noise level mark. Distortion levels are good and certainly nothing to worry about but we have seen some do even better. All that said, the MILESTONE audio output isn't bad in general, it just isn't as good as most other aspects of the device's performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see what the MILESTONE is up to for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A pretty good 5 megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things Motorola MILESTONE has a 5 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels and dual-LED flash. The Open Handset Alliance finally decided to do something about the camera features in Android 2.0 ? i.e. they actually included a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new stuff includes built-in flash support (apparently the Samsung Galaxy made use of some home-brewed drivers to get around that limitation), digital zoom, scene mode, white balance, color effects and macro focus mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, it doesn't seem much: other companies have had those in their cameraphones for ages but for the Android community this is a huge step forward. Rome wasn't built in a day after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty decent, although not exactly perfect. You have all the options on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder which can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key. With so few options at hand we don't see why most of them aren't available as onscreen shortcuts to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead the only things that are accessible all the time on screen is a switch for alternating the camcorder and the still camera, a virtual shutter key and a shortcut to the gallery docked in the bottom right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, when it comes to the actual product of the Motorola MILESTONE camera - the photos - we're quite pleased with the image quality. There's plenty of resolved detail, the colors are also nicely saturated and the images are quite punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the same time though, there is quite a lot of noise and some oversharpening artifacts. Even though there's some aggressive noise reduction smearing fine detail away there are still patches where the chromatic noise is excessive. The jagged edges in some cases also indicate that Motorola still have some work to do before they catch up with the best in the business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>D1 video recording comes to Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the MILESTONE is as good as we have ever seen on an Android handset. D1 resolution (720 x 480 pixels) at 30 fps is where its capabilities end and we doubt its users will need much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the video quality, the maximum duration of the clip, adjust white balance, apply color effects and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in 3gp format which suggests lower bitrate, which in turn leads to some compression artifacts. On the other hand, colors are really pleasing and the videos look very nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flawless connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is certainly another area where the Motorola MILESTONE excels. For starters you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for worldwide roaming and dual-band (900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA. The HSDPA is quoted at 10.2 Mbps and the HSUPA can reach up to 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then move on to local connectivity ? the MILESTONE offers USB v2.0, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier. And now that they have enabled Bluetooth transfers, there is very little more to be asked for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing that would ask for is tethering, as we simply could not get our MILESTONE to do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back on the positive track we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No flash support troubles the great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With such an ample high-res screen and a full QWERTY keyboard, the Motorola MILESTONE looks like the logical choice for people who take handheld browsing seriously. The Multi-touch support allows the pinch zoom, while the great Android Webkit-based browser provides one of the coolest interfaces in the business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.0 also introduces the double tap zooming gesture, whereby double-clicking on a selected part of a web page quickly zooms in on it to fill the screen. Regardless whether you use this option or the pinching gesture zooming, it is smooth and fluid and the same goes for panning and scrolling around the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Motorola MILESTONE doesn?t support text reflow while zooming to maximize its usability but given how wonderful the high-res screen, we are almost willing to let that one go unpunished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new feature is the address bar, which is now constantly available so typing a new address is easier than ever. With the high resolution there is still plenty of space available for the website contents to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final new feature brought by the new OS version is bookmark enhancement with page thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser allows you to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves smooth transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough we didn?t see the magnifier functionality that was present in the other recent Android handsets that we reviewed. It?s certainly not missed too much given there is another zooming gesture to replace it but we just don?t see why they had to remove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excellent multi-page support is of course still available and the rendering algorithm is basically flawless. As you may suspect, the Android browser is fast and the interface clean. But unlike so many of its smartphone siblings, Flash support is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet things might improve in the future as the browser supports HTML5 and its video tag that allows videos to be streamed even without flash. This is again only a partial solution as there are too few sites using it at the moment (after all even most desktop browsers don?t support it yet) and, of course, it only works for video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer does the job with some help from the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its Android siblings, the Motorola MILESTONE comes with a nicely stocked organizer, though it does lack a preinstalled document viewer. Luckily you can fix that instantly by getting the one of the free apps from the Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, the free version of Quickoffice has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, which makes viewing attachments easy. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them in the phone's memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the MILESTONE the agenda view allows infinite scrolling in case that is how you like to browse your events. The events notifications have also been updated and now show the attending status for each invitee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and very comfy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally comes the YouTube app, which as we said, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash video support. Its interface is simple enough to allow you to find what you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE comes with a capable GPS receiver, which coupled with A-GPS technology, gets a sattelite lock decently fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that the Google Maps applications comes preinstalled, but this time you also get Motorola's proprietary MOTONAV software. Unfortunately, you have to pay extra for voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of the Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation isn't possible using Google Maps like on the MILESTONE American cousin - Motorola DROID. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually... assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So to put it simply if you want to use proper navigation on your MILESTONE you will have to either purchase a MOTONAV license or download a third party app from the Android Market. In any case you should be prepared to pay at least 50 euro a year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as with every other Android there isn't too many preinstalled applications on the Motorola MILESTONE. The reason behind this is simple: with the Android Market open for business you can find a large number of apps (most of them free by the way) which can be downloaded directly from the handset using Wi-Fi or the mobile network at only a few clicks expense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the warning shown if the application you're about to download has potentially unsafe access to personal data, connectivity settings, etc. The warning says exactly what data will be accessed so you can abort the download if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market follows the logic of the pioneering Apple App Store. Everything about it - the structure, the look - is pretty familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty useless (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers and video players).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, well - what a nice surprise we have here. The Motorola MILESTONE seems to be exactly the device the company needed. The one to grab it by the scruff of the neck and pull it out of the mess it got itself into. You know, ever since the razors started to get a little blunt and long in the tooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MOTO army have taken serious casualties recently so heavily armed new recruits were desperately needed. But Motorola obviously believed a good general is worth more than a regiment so along came the MILESTONE. A device that generates prestige as well as income is nothing short of a phenomenal success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is that even the fearsome Nexus One is unlikely to really upset the MILESTONE: the QWERTY keyboard and multi-touch are enough to secure it against Google's new gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Google Nexus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seem to be not too many direct rivals hitting the shelves soon either so the sun will keep shining for quite a while on this one. Motorola will have plenty of time to develop a worthy successor, and will get recognition as one of - if not THE - leading manufacturer in the increasingly crowded Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That in turn will perhaps benefit the sales of their other Google OS phones - unusual handsets like the Motorola BackFlip need all the positive exposure they can get or otherwise they risk being poorly judged and dismissed as just gimmicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, cool as it may be, the Motorola MILESTONE isn't without competition. Unlike the entry-level touchscreen smartphone race where Nokia is pretty much the only horse, it's pretty crowded at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 and the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO are solid QWERTY-enabled PocketPCs that will certainly do the job if it's the MILESTONE features rather than the OS that you are after. They probably offer more 3rd party software than the Android-running MILESTONE but most of it isn't in the Windows Marketplace yet and you will have to do the searching yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Touch Pro2 ? Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 is another handset that matches the hardware functionality of the Motorola MILESTONE and even comes at a much lower price. However, the unpolished S60 UI cannot rival Android for either user-friendliness or 3rd party software availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N97</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is plenty of potential there of course, given the huge S60 user base, but if you care about potential we would rather recommend the Nokia N900. It packs one of the best browsers we've seen and it's cheaper than the MILESTONE. We shouldn't forget either that Nokia handsets are about to receive free lifetime voice navigation, which is a great value boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it seems there're enough MILESTONE alternatives outside the Android world but if you insist on this platform (and we believe there are plenty of people who do) the rather outdated G1 is pretty much your only option. And it really only has a slightly lower price in its favor, while the MILESTONE blows it away in almost every other category. If you are looking for a high-end Android, this is really your only choice at the moment.</paragraph>
