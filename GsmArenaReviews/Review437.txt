			<paragraph>Nokia is a company, which can take liberty to experiment. And it does. The 7380 model looks like a chocolate bar. Instead of a display it has a small mirror, instead of a keypad - a scroll wheel. On the side of the device Nokia has attached a fabric logo, similar to the ones we see on luxury T-shirts. At the same time Nokia 7380 is a very good mobile phone with operational system that is not so difficult to get used to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the previous model Nokia 7280 hit the market, I didn't manage to have a look at it because my colleague David Polesný seized it for testing. Eventually he was quite content with the phone claiming it was really good. Of course, none of us would believe him. Nobody with standard approach to mobile phones would use such device voluntarily. We found that out after just a few minutes of manipulation with Nokia 7280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Official photos of Nokia 7380 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, I did not forget the disagreement between David's opinion and my colleagues' and my point of view, so when Nokia 7380 was launched I was the first to grab it. I used it as my main mobile phone for more than a week and I was literally impressed. Nokia 7380 is a very good phone indeed!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What is L'Amour?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 is the most stylish of the most stylish. It is a phone made to radiate joy. The phone is a decorative accessory, a reason for brags and perhaps for some envy. If you tend to see this device from the "so this is the new nonsense from Nokia" point of view, I guess you will hardly change your opinion. In any case, I can assure you that everyone, whom I showed the 7380 model, ended up totally excited about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone appeals most of all to women, which is no wonder as women are meant to be its target customer group. As you can imagine, an assembly of a mirror, flower symbols and a fabric logo look extremely inappropriate in any man's hand. In this sense, it is quite a pity that Nokia didn't come with a masculine version of the same model, which could differ from the feminine one by covers only. Try to imagine it: cold design as we know it from sci-fi movies, metal materials and various polishing modalities? That is exactly how I imagine the ideal second mobile phone for technology fans - a complement to a smartphone or a communicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Original package: a metal box wrapped up in paper, which strongly resembles a box of English cookies</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, Nokia 7380 may surprise even experienced professionals. No matter how accustomed we are to different types of mobile constructions, a bar with no display at first sight, which lacks a keypad and beams with a fiery red LED, looks magnificent. Together with the 7380 model Nokia has presented other two phones of the L'Amour line, in which the accent has been placed more on fashion and not so much on style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Two more phones of the same line: Nokia 7370 and 7360</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It is usable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 is a glamorous jewel of a unique construction, but can it be used as a normal phone device? Is control without a numeric keypad possible at all?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, I won't hide that handling this Nokia 7380 cost me certain trade-off moves. If you write a lot of SMS, then you should forget about this phone straight away as text writing is a nightmare. But if you write one SMS per day or even less, then you can manage with it quite well. Writing is assisted by a technology that slightly reminds T9 dictionary. Any phone number's 9 numeral characters can be dialed relatively fast too. In addition, the phone offers an excellent voice dialing option and doesn't need to be taught in advance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, Nokia 7380 is usable. The problem is that the more stylish and exceptional a phone is, the more practical inconveniences it brings with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Construction and design: a fabric logo on the side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 is a bar of 114 x 30 x 20 mm. It weighs 80 g. In other words, it's a very small and light phone. Its construction is solid and stable. The phone is made of high quality plastic materials. It looks respectable and business-like, especially due to the matt back cover touched in an ivory nuance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  It's a small and surprisingly space-saving phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380's entire front cover is basically a mirror. In its upper part you will see flower motives, which hide the microphone. The rings located in the bottom part of the front cover look like decorative elements, but they actually represent phone's functional keys and scroll controller. For more details on the latter, see further on. I suppose I don't need to mention the fact that all finger prints left on the mirror are obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower motives ? a true mirror</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any press on a random key activates the display located in the middle of the mirror. Otherwise, it is practically impossible to notice. You have to explore the mirror's surface really carefully to see that it's a little bit darker in the area above the display. On the other hand, because of the reflexivity of the mirror of Nokia 7380, the display is much more difficult to see under direct sun light than displays of common phones. As it works in a landscape mode I had to turn the phone to an angle of 90° and hold it horizontally.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Looked at abeam Nokia 7380 reminds of a circus arena. Its matt brown-goldish layer merges into a chromium-plated gold band. The latter is incrusted with orange elements. The back side of the phone is manufactured in soft beige. The phone's rear cover is irremovable, which makes the battery practically inaccessible. The SIM card fits into a slot located on the phone's side part, whose moving cover is the only loose part on the entire device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  SIM card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On one side of the device you will see the loud speaker, while the other side is decorated with a plate with the Nokia logo. This plate plays no functional role. It is decorative only, which I find quite regretful as it could have been used as an ideal release button for the camera application. The phone has no system connector. Instead, it is equipped with jacks for the charger (the old big connector) and the handsfree/earphones. Of course, the phone has an eyelet to thread the pretty silver chain delivered in the original package. In the box you will also find a luxury silky golden case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless plate ? loud speaker ? a party of connectors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fabric case and metal chain </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When I saw Nokia 7380 on the first official pictures, I got the impression that its back side was covered with true leather, but it's not. The used material only resembles leather and is similar to the one applied on the dashboards of some automobiles. On the back you will find nothing else but the camera lens accompanied by a flash LED. Nokia 7380 doesn't have an infrared port, opposing to its forerunner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;This is not leather</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I forgot to mention one detail, which may seem pointless, but also raised the greatest attention of those around me: the fabric logo on the side of the phone. Nokia has copied this low profile advertising method from world's most famous luxurious brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Details make difference</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: fine and horizontal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the older Nokia 7280 was breaking records at the time, being the finest mobile phone display manufactured ever. Nowadays, it is still impressive, even if not a miracle anymore. Same old 4807 pixels on a square centimeter make Nokia 7380 display look extremely fine. It has an untypical resolution of 208 x 104 pixels and a relatively small size of 30 x 15 mm. It's active and shows 65K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Display is very fine even nowadays</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User's environment in Nokia 7380 is predetermined by the landscape mode of the display. Even though the phone belongs to Series 40, its menu looks different, behaves in a different way and is controlled with different methods. The display is divided into two functional sections. The right section (1/3 of the entire display) contains descriptions of the functional keys, while the left one is reserved for work area. Space is evidently being wasted with this type of distribution, but I presume that the landscape mode of the display wouldn't permit applying a different one. The drawbacks caused by the small size of the display are most visible in WAP. Picture views can sometimes be problematic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Phone's environment&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are several graphic themes available</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A scroll wheel instead of a keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both control elements and the entire navigation process in Nokia 7380 are worthy of closer attention despite the absence of a common keypad. Let me start with the two functional buttons and the two keys for call control. They are all located in the outer ring: the functional keys are closer to the display, while the green and the red receivers are placed at the opposite end. Rubber ribbons cover the phone's micro switches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the middle of the entire assembly there is a red button. Inside it there is a red light, which glows nice when the phone is in an inactive mode. It slowly lights up and fades away repeatedly. In case of missed calls or unread messages it starts to twinkle and thus alerts you even if the display is inactive. The red LED twinkles in a different way according to the type of event that has been missed. The backlighting of the other control elements has been designed with elegancy as well. The following picture will give you a more precise idea of it:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Impressive key backlighting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important element in Nokia 7380 is its scroll control wheel, or Navi Spinner. It's a ring around the middle button, which scrolls both ways without restraint. 360 degrees are divided into 16 segments by the help of soft end stops. These segments correspond to the items in a common main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Buttons are in the outer semi-ring, confirming key is in the middle, control wheel is in-between</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you think, do not expect the phone to manage everything if you scroll unstoppably. I recommend you to stay calm and not overspeed scrolling, especially when you are inside the main menu. On the other hand, when you search the phonebook, Nokia 7380 takes a precise record even if you scroll fast. So when you stop, it takes you where it was supposed to, even if it doesn't give any indication of follow-up in the meantime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The method of scroll control may seem quite unusual, but it isn't uncomfortable. Unfortunately, left-handers are in a disadvantage as the scroll button is located on the right side of the phone. What a pity since we know that this obstacle can easily be eliminated by applying a software turn option for the display. The keypad can be locked either manually, or automatically.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>How to make calls with a chocolate bar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Generally, the phone is comfortable to hold, with the microphone being where you would expect to be. Things get complicated when you need to start a call. If the person you are calling is part of the phonebook, the fastest way to get in touch with them is the intelligent voice dialing option. To do so, long-press the relevant button and pronounce the name of the person. The phone doesn't need to be taught in advance. It would recognize your voice immediately, search the contact list and within a second or so would start to dial the recipient's default number. The success depends on your voice: in my case it was nearly 100 %, but I know other people, who ran into difficulties. Nokia 7380 has several special functions, whose main purpose is to support the voice dialing application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Dialing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the phonebook is a little bit complicated as the phone only lets you select the first letter, after which you have to browse on through the contact list. Fortunately, the control wheel is faster than any ordinary keypad. Anyway, I would recommend you to use voice dialing. Entering a new phone number is not an easy task to complete, either. You will see a bar, from which you choose digits, which you then select by pressing the middle red button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Entering a number</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I'm not satisfied with the sound provided by the earphones. It is harsh and unpleasant. Durability was disappointing too. I had to charge Nokia 7380 every two days even though I was using it in a quite reasonable way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First name/Last name synchronization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 has a built-in phonebook with 1000 positions for contact names. I tried immediately to synchronize it with Outlook. Once again I had to admit how convenient it is that Nokia does not require installing a special program for each of its models. The standart PC Suite works. Nevertheless, the First name/Last name synchronization order, typical for all Series 40 models, has been kept, which isn't very practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Phonebook ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can contain a lot of fields. Apart from several phone numbers, each contact can also be assigned a pair of text details and a picture, which is displayed as a tiny icon when the corresponding person is calling you or is being called by you. Individual ringing melodies can be assigned to groups of contacts only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>64-voice polyphony is a nice feature, but it doesn't impress anymore, especially when the phone supports ringing melodies in MP3 format. Nokia 7380 has pleasant ringing sound with clear bass elements. A reasonably strong vibration option is available as well. You can setup a filter to sort calls by group within the profiles. You can also use a handsfree set, which comes in handy if you work in an office, where the noise level is high. The phone allows 60-minute call recording. The disadvantage is that during the recording process the opposite side hears a constant beep sound.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages for long winter nights<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message application will probably be one of the most rarely used applications in Nokia 7380 due to the lack of a keypad. You will be able to read messages but you will definitely think twice before you send a reply (this is the moment to apologize for not reacting to all those who sent me Christmas and New Year's Eve greetings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Message menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So how are messages written in Nokia 7380 then? The answer is: in precisely the same way numbers are dialed, you need to scroll both ways and select the letters you wish to use. Searching is assisted by a certain application, which slightly reminds of T9 dictionary. When you write a particular letter, the phone guesses which letter may follow and offers it on first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Writing SMS ? Notice the letters at the beginning of the bottom bar, which look as if they were random - in fact, the phone guesses which ones may suite purpose</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example: let's try to write the word pono?ka (sock). Finding P requires searching the entire Alphabet, while O is located on third place. To find N you will need to go through a long line of letters once again. O (again) as well as the rest of the letters are given certain priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The word assistance option can be deactivated if necessary. Besides it, Nokia 7380 offers a series of letters with exotic diacritics, a block with digits and a block with punctuation characters. Generally, text writing with Nokia 7380 is not impossible, but it has nothing to do with the comfort we are used to, supplied in mobiles with common keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is obviously aware of the difficulties caused by the lack of a standard keypad, because, instead of SMS, it offers an easy-to-control function called Sound message. By pressing the appropriate key, a record is started. After you say what you need to say, you can send the result via MMS. The MMS editor is similar to the editor in other Nokia models. It is WYSIWYG type. Inserted pictures are displayed in a preview only. There is no email client in Nokia 7380.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;MMS Editor</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The calendar has to fit into a smaller display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock in Nokia 7380 is repeated. Both the days of the alarm activity and its particular sound can be individually set up. Sounds can be found and selected from the gallery. It's also possible to use the built-in radio option as an alarm, but that requires an earphone - antenna to be attached to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Setting up the alarm clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image of Nokia 7380 calendar has suffered a significant loss due to the smaller size of the display. Yet, familiar day, week and month views are all present and can be all synchronized with a PC too. Alerts and repeating options can be attached directly from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Various views at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 is equipped with a simple To-do and an even simpler note application. They both can store a maximum of 20 items. The voice recorder is a bit better, it allows 60-minute long recording.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2 MP in a "non-smart" phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 has 52 MB of memory space, which is why I cannot recognize it as a MP3 player. Not even if it is able to work as such and to provide stereo sound through the earphones delivered in the original box. My reasons are simple: if there is too little memory, the phone loses points. It just cannot be recommended as a MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio is something else. To make it function properly, attach an earphone, which will serve as an antenna. You can save and name up to 20 stations. There is both manual and automatic tuning available. Both the radio and the MP3 player can be played through the loud speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the first time that Nokia implies a 2 megapixel camera in a common phone. Pictures are taken in 1600 x 1200 pixels resolution. Setup and modification options are marginal. When you capture a scene, it appears on the display, but its image is often difficult to recognize as the display is too small. Eventually, pictures can be sent via MMS or transferred to another device through Bluetooth. They can be additionally downloaded with the use of PC Suite if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera's environment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 takes pictures with significant quality, when the weather conditions are good, which surprised me pleasantly. I took images that could even be placed on a website if needed. After certain minor modifications, of course. Quality gets worse if pictures are taken indoors as the lack of light increases the noise level, but they aren't so bad in general. What is really catastrophic is the macro mode. As a rule, camera lenses without auto focus or mechanic switcher do not have a good macro mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos taken with Nokia 7380:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video application features low resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and it's significantly worse than the camera one. On the other hand, it is able to make an hour long video records.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The phone is quite fast if used for common work. But once you enter the gallery, it slows greatly. At the same time, slide shows of megapixel pictures are relatively flexible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No games, no Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 has no games.It doesn't support Java applications, so you cannot download games either. As you can see, midlets do not work well with the landscape display and the control wheel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 establishes internet connection through a built-in modem. As far as communication with PC is concerned, the only possible method implies Bluetooth. Nokia 7380 doesn't have an infrared port, unlike its forerunner. Even though Nokia doesn't mention EDGE among the phone's specifics, after certain observations have been made, we tend to think that Nokia 7380 supports this technology. But even if it is true, no information about EDGE connection path or EDGE being present in the correspondent network appears on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a simple built-in WAP browser. Unfortunately, some web pages get scattered as a result of the landscape mode of the display. Still, the browser is able to open unsophisticated internet pages like the text version of MobilMania, for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Will anything similar ever be made for men?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I spent Christmas with Nokia 7380. It was my main mobile phone for more than a week. No matter how skeptic I was at the beginning (just like anyone who has only seen pictures of the phone or has had it for few short minutes), I have no other option but to agree with my colleague Polesn?: Nokia 7380 is not only an extremely attractive mobile phone, but also a phone full of useful applications, even if these require certain trade-offs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality Nokia 7380 is a fully sufficient phone. It is a standard middle-class mobile device with several interesting innovations. I would like to highlight phone's excellent speaker independent voice dialing and is applicable in the entire phonebook. If we look back, we will find this same function in Nokia N70 smartphone, but Nokia 7380 is the first "non-smart" phone to have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Charger, wrapped up with its cable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7380 is extremely expensive. Its price is a little bit higher than 530 euro. It gains many points for design and cool style, but as far as the relation price / performance is concerned I do not dare recommending it to anyone. Things may become much more interesting if Nokia offered a similar bijou for men. However, for the moment we will have to content ourselves with the L'Amour line suitable for women only.</paragraph>
