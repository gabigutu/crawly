			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 is RIM?s first ever-released Curve with a touchscreen. The Curve lineup is usually an expression of RIM?s understanding for a budget phone and this one supposedly, doesn?t make a difference. It should attract customers with a lower entry price while offering the full BB OS 7 experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Curve 9380 is basically a downgraded Torch 9860 ? it has a less-capable processor and smaller and low-res display. Both gadgets look similar too, but the Curve's pricetags makes up for the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let?s take a look at the Curve 9380 full feature list, followed by potential deal-breakers as we saw them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, most of the listed drawbacks of the new Curve are typical BlackBerry. So if tyou are even thinking about getting any of RIM?s phones, you?ve probably already accepted to live with those ? the mandatory BIS plan for emails and data traffic as well as the poor variety of apps and the high App World prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Curve 9380 offers the latest BlackBerry experience on a cheaper price and without losing much of its appeal. The BlackBerry OS 7 on this Curve is as capable and fast as on the Torch 9860, the main difference being the lack of HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our traditional hardware tour starts right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Curve 9380<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Curve 9380 comes with a standard set of accessories - a USB cable, a charger head and a set of headphones are provided. You get a complimentary 2GB MicroSD card as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Curve 9380 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 looks like a smaller version of the Torch 9860. Thanks to its 3.2" display the new Curve is quite pocket friendly - it spreads at 109 x 60 x 11.2 mm and weighs just 98 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9380 is made entirely of plastic - the reason why it weighs just 98g. Despite the similarities with the Torch 9860 design, there is no metal on the panels this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the material used on the new Curve is black glossy plastic so there will be lots of fingerprints, smudges and unpleasant marks of whatever touches the phone. The only parts that are not glossy are the already mentioned chrome framing and some rubberized second frame for the side controls and the camera/flash combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front bezel is occupied by the 3.2" HVGA capacitive touchscreen with 188ppi pixel density. It's not among the best we've seen, but the display is actually quite good - vibrant colors and decent contrast, very good viewing angles and the sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing that we don?t like about the RIM's touchscreens is the lack of haptic feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, there?s the typical BlackBerry navigation combo of Call keys, Menu and Back buttons. They're all big enough for comfortable use. Unfortunately, all four controls are part of one plastic plate and because of that - the inner two are really tough to press. Placed in the middle is the trackpad, which will get its share of use, especially in the system menus that aren't all that touch friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece and status LED are the things to note above the display, where the BlackBerry logo takes a prominent spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Curve 9380 there's only a MicroUSB port used for charging and file transfers. Its central position is not the most comfortable but it looks neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume keys are on the right side, with a very subtle mute button in between. It doubles as play/pause button in the music player. The convenience key near the bottom is set by default to serve the fixed-focus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock button is placed at the top of the BlackBerry Curve 9380 but similar with some of the front controls, the Lock key is also pretty tough to press with no tactile feedback. The unprotected 3.5mm audio jack is also nearby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone has the same glossy plastic finish as the top and only features the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera lens and the LED flash are at the back surrounded by rubberized plastic. The black glossy battery cover, although looking pretty, gets smudgy very fast and isn?t that nice to touch. A chrome plastic frame runs around the back and the side controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover you'll see the 1250 mAh Li-Ion battery and the hot-swappable microSD card slot. The SIM compartment is under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery of the Curve 9380 achieved a score of the average rate of 39 hours in our battery test. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 39 hours. You can check out the full scoop on the Curve 9380 performance over at our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Curve 9380 battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 is a compact, pocket-friendly and easy to handle. There is nothing new or unique with its design, or the materials it is made of. But like most of the RIM smartphones, the Curve 9380 is excellently built without any wobbling or creaking. We are not impressed by its design, the new Curve is still a looker and if it wasn't for the glossy plastic, it might have been another beauty within the BlackBerry lineup. We guess that's not the point of the mid-rangers though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7 is new, but doesn?t feel like it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already met with the RIM's latest OS on numerous phones with different hardware. At first it was a pleasure, but then it is inevitable to realize it?s the same old OS with the bare minimum of touch-optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when we thought we saw everything, here comes the first ever touch-only Curve. It's a small and cute gadget, supposedly cheaper than its other touch-capable siblings. The 3.2" display has HVGA resolution, but the BB OS 7 is good in resolution scaling so it fits equally well on the VGA or even the WVGA ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to look at the BB OS 7 in detail once again, for a complete and comprehensive coverage of the phone and its features. There are parts of reused text but that's inevitable given most of the interface is the same, it?s only scaled differently. And you can rest assured that all the BlackBerry Curve 9380 specifics are duly reflected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Number 7 is the last upgrade of the OS before the upcoming switch to QNX. The OS 7 brings few new features (NFC and HD video are well worth a mention though) and focus rather goes to the improved user experience instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new platform is based on more potent graphics hardware, and it?s exactly the higher system requirements that won?t allow older BlackBerry phones to run the new BB OS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 looks are inspired by the Playbook's QNX-based tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same as you've seen it through the years - all functionality changes are kept to a minimum for good or bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has virtual buttons in a row, allowing you to quickly toggle the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It gives you quick access too to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7 is voice search enabled, too. Tapping on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. You can easily swipe it out of sight or pull it up to show one to five rows of icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sideways swipes reveal the different panes that sort the main menu into All, Favorites, Media, Downloads and Frequent. The frequently used apps list are auto populated by the system. You can define which of the main menu panes should be shown. Folders can be added to the main menu and items can be moved into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use the menu key or tap and hold on an icon to reveal options such as Move, Mark as Favorite, Move to folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there is a trackpad and there is a touchscreen. The trackpad is the usual sharp and precise control. One place where it makes a lot of sense is in listed submenus that pop up as you press the Menu key. Not that they are not thumbable - it's just that wrong presses are completely ruled out with the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much everything you see is clickable in BlackBerry OS 7 and works the way it's supposed to. There are still small elements such as the homescreen Search and Profiles icons, which are easier to access via the trackpad rather than the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Curve 9380 has a menu button to access options that are not visible on the screen. You get used to that pretty quickly though so in the end, the Curve 9380 manages to keep both new and returning users happy. Trackpad and touchscreen complete each other in a natural way.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A white phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 may run a new edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities get displayed. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Curve 9380 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Curve 9380 is the usual solid performer. No voice quality or reception issues. Smart dial is, of course, enabled - you only need an extra tap on the Search button to bring up the virtual QWERTY keyboard. It's still a quick way of locating contacts on the handset. You just punch a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggestions is promptly returned. You can then select the contact you need with the trackpad or tap directly on its icon to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 scored a Below Average mark in our traditional loudspeaker test, so missed calls and events are likely to occur. You should keep an eye out for the notification LED.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You surely need a BIS plan for emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 handles has all kinds of messages. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Curve 9380. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it. Without an enterprise account, your only option is web-based email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not all carriers are offering BIS. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its name over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 has no hardware keyboard. The virtual QWERTY does a good job in landscape mode but in portrait the limited space is a problem. Extra care was needed to avoid wrong hits.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same ol' gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all the BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid or viewed as a standard list. There?s searching by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our image files, so we won?t count that one in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9380 has a built-in accelerometer to automatically toggle portrait and landscape mode as you browse your picture collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are panning and zooming, including the pinch zoom. A tap and hold on a picture provides shortcuts for sending, copying and renaming. You can set it as wallpaper as well or use as a contact photo. Further options such as image properties, rotate or slide show are available in a popup menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New icons for the music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surely, RIM has refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s basically all they did. It?s still pretty conservatively styled, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick searching of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Creating custom playlists is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, but unfortunately, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We admire the whole OS 7 lineup for its video-playing capabilities and the Curve 9380 is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2" screen is perhaps big enough for decent video consumption. The video player's interface might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen plus a dedicated fit/zoom to screen one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9380 video player promises to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but the XviD ones didn?t go that easy. Some of the files were OK, while others where just incompatible. It seems it's either the bitrate or audio codec that were to blame, but whatever it is, we won't count on that XviD support much if we were you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick, but unfortunate advice for you - if you want a smartphone with good audio output stay clear of the BlackBerry Curve 9380.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RIM smartphone did quite uninspiringly in the first part of our test - when connected to an active external amplifier. So if you are using it with your home stereo or car audio you will get decent noise levels, dynamic range and limited stereo crosstalk, but imperfect frequency response and above average intermodulation distortion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But as soon as you plug in a pair of headphones in this one, things are really starting to look grim. Distortion levels go through the roof and so does stereo crosstalk. At the end, you are stuck with an output that's quite far of the source signal and that is unacceptable for a modern-day smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5 megapixel fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 comes with a 5 fixed-focus camera which is still the highest resolution you can get in a RIM smartphone. There is a single LED flash too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. A shortcut bar at the bottom of the viewfinder is standing in the way of proper framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter (the convenience) key is unusually shaped but actually quite comfortable. If nothing else, it's the quicker and easier way, and you can shoot with a single press of the trackpad, shutter key or the virtual shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Curve 9380. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Curve 9380 is about average - there is a good amount of resolved detail, although it could have been much better, the colors are pleasing. Contrast is fine, too, but the noise levels are way above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Curve 9380 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. Here you can see the Curve 9380 is a decent performer, but you can still notice the high noise levels and the pink spot at the center.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 is incapable of capturing HD videos, most probably because of its lower processor clock. The best it can do is VGA clips at 30 fps. The LED can be used as video light, no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is up to scratch ? the frame rate is good, the resolved detail is adequate, the noise levels tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. Overall, it's thumbs up for the BlackBerry Curve 9380 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a VGA video sample from the Curve 9380 camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity welcomes NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect from a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the quad-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The dual-band Wi-Fi is also a nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also supported. Stereo Bluetooth rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 has a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9380 is NFC capable too. You can pair it with other NFC-enabled devices and NFC accessories as well as read NFC tags.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is good, but no Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Curve 9380 is a nice improvement for the BB platform. It is comparably fast and responsive, it supports multi-touch zooming, text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing missing is Flash support really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it does have its woes, we?ll give it that. Based on the Apple?s WebKit engine and using a similar caching system as the iPhone, the new BB browser reacts surprisingly like the one on the iPhone 4. Unfortunately, its performance is not quite the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, both browsers use what is known as a backing store to cache the already rendered page thus they show showing users a texture, rather than a real page. This way you always get a great performance while panning or interacting with the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in, the browser is not ready with the new texture, so it simply zooms in the already rendered one, effectively upsizing it, which makes both the text and images look blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here?s where the difference in the performance of the iPhone 4 and the BlackBerry Curve 9380 shows up. When you zoom in on a portion of the text, on the BlackBerry it does take a second or two to clear up the hazy cached image of the text, while on the iPhone 4 that?s an instantaneous action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you got speed in panning and scrolling, even in zooming because the texture is quick to refresh rather than to zoom on a heavy page, but you get a little annoying refresh moments on zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that's something you won't see on a stock Android browser because the fonts there are rendered in real time. But the heavier the page is on Android, the longer the refresh time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, again unlike the stock Android browser, the text reflow works only once - when the text is out-zoomed and you double tap on it. The text reflow stops working when you zoom in even more or turn the phone in landscape mode. The iPhone 4 web browser works the same way however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we won?t bore you to death with these little nitpickings. The BlackBerry Curve 9380 web browser is a fast and modern piece of software, it renders pages nicely almost like a desktop browser and it will always get the job done unless you?re reaching for some Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that if you decide to use the trackpad for navigation instead of the touchscreen, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except for the missing Flash support, the handset provides a solid browsing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business objectives, the Curve 9380 has a solid set of organizer tools. Although the interface is not preoccupied with looks, the usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be accessed via the menu and trackpad. You can set the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another way to get more alarms though. You can go the the Calendar app and choose to add a new alarm from the menu. It allows you to put subject and recurrence too and works just like the alarm in the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9380 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock comes on screen any time the phone is being charged and also offers a bedside mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks. There is a digital compass too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Protect is onboard. It can locate and remotely lock/wipe your lost or stolen device. It also syncs your data and can easy transfer everything to a new BlackBerry device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Curve 9380 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal. Some apps you can get for free of course. Apps can be managed on a computer. There are enough categories and a search box to make searching easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest titles. In general there's hardly much to complain about the BlackBerry App world interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, and to make it worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, as usual, while downloading an app from the AppWorld you can barely do anything else with the phone while downloading.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The BIS plans is what makes the BlackBerry Maps tick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Curve 9380 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated, including more cities than ever. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's like we already met with the Curve 9380. Since it?s a completely different approach to the Curve lineup there is just no basis for parallels with older Curves. But remembering the previous BlackBerry OS 7-based smartphones we had, the Torch 9860 will surely ring a bell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-only Torch packs a bigger 3.7" WVGA display and a faster 1.2GHz processor. And these are all the differences over our guest of honour - the Curve 9380. Saving on the hardware makes sense though - it fits perfectly on the Curve's idea for a cheaper price tag. But don?t get too excited yet, the RIM's understanding for cheap have always been a lot different from the traditional smartphone user opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the new Curve 9380 is not something we haven?t seen so far, it's a downgrade on an already familiar phone. But surprisingly, this actually works. While the Torch 9860 was big and not every RIM user's choice, the new Curve is smaller and lighter, but still equally capable and running the OS 7 as smoothly as any other OS 7-based BlackBerry. And don?t worry about the screen - its ppi, contrast and sunlight legibility are very good so you'll hardly notice the lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We talked a lot about the Torch 9860, so it makes sense for it to be the Curve 9380 main competitor. The reason is quite simple - the price gap between those two is less than ?80 making the Torch 9860 an attractive, even tempting alternative. But once again, the Torch is bigger and heavier than the Curve - so it?s not for everyone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In case you want to keep both the new OS 7 and the hardware keyboard, then the Curve 9360 is your perfect fit. This QWERTY-fied Curve has exactly the same specs and features as the Curve 9380, but its display isn't touch-capable and you'll lose the NFC-capabilities. Both Curves are equally priced.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Jumping outside of the RIM's camp shows completely different world, as usual. The BlackBerries have always been more expensive than the regular droid smartphones and you could get lots of capable droids for the Curve's 9380 money ? the LG Optimus 2X, the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc or the Samsung Galaxy S Plus, while the LG Optimus Black is even cheaper.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The high prices are not in favour of the BlackBerries, but as we see it, there is no chance RIM to reconsider its pricing policy any time soon. So either you are getting this Curve with a solid carrier deal or you should not be getting it at all. And the chances for this one to convert some new users to RIM's side are incredibly slim. Sad, but true.</paragraph>
