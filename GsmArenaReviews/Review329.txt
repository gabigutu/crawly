			<paragraph>We called Sony Ericsson K810 the rebirth of the Cyber-shot. We're now looking at a great leap forward in developing the company's cameraphone lineup in the face of the glamorous Sony Ericsson K850. It brings a bunch of novelties in design, navigation and functionality. The quality 5 megapixel camera enhanced with camerawise hardware buttons, along with the brand new Media Center application, make the Sony Ericsson K850 a landmark product in the company portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In June Sony Ericsson revealed its hottest addition to the Cyber-shot line: Sony Ericsson K850. The phone was labeled a milestone product not only for the Cyber-shot family, but for the entire Sony Ericsson portfolio. It is clear why it scores high with its wealth of features using the latest technologies. The K850 brings several brand new software and hardware solutions we pay special attention to later on. Make sure you keep in mind the three Cyber-shot handsets we reviewed most recently - the budget Sony Ericsson K550, the high-born Sony Ericsson K800 and its successful inheritor Sony Ericsson K810.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cyber-shot evolves<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The soft and rounded Sony Ericsson K850 visually differs a lot from the Sony Ericsson K810, not to mention its predecessors. At least it stays faithful to the bar-shape form factor. K850 accommodates some notable construction and navigation novelties: dedicated call and end keys, new D-pad layout, three-position camera key, as well as an on/off camera key and a digicam-like bottom battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large 2.2" quality TFT display takes up most of the front panel and scores notably higher both in brightness and contrast, compared to the 2" TFT display of Sony Ericsson K810. Keeping almost the same dimensions while building larger displays is an issue that constantly nudges handset designers. In K850 the obvious solution is integrating the D-pad in the keyboard, thus making some room for the larger 2.2" display. The display, and the entire front panel, has a nice mirror-like finish, but again it catches fingerprints rather easily, like the K810 and K800. Above it, a small secondary VGA camera is discretely located, along with the earpiece. The camera is beneath the panel surface, leaving the even surface of the front unspoiled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below the display, we find the three brand new sensor like soft keys. They perform multiple functions varying by the context of different applications. The sensor like soft keys offer a truly novel experience in handling the Sony Ericsson K850. The diehard Sony Ericsson user will immediately notice that the location of the soft key functions are reversed. In other Sony Ericsson phones the More soft key is located on the right, whereas now it is called Options and corresponds to the new left soft key, with several exceptions. The proprietary "Back" key is absent, now replaced by the right soft key. The center soft key performs variable functions within applications. The logic behind all this is simple - in menus, where in other Sony Ericsson phones you have only one active soft key, the center soft key is to be used. Alternatively, in menus where both soft keys have functions (for example messaging -&gt; templates), in other handsets you would have "Select" and "Info", while in K850 you have "Info", "Select" and "Back" soft key order. Reviewing the K850 was fun, as we often pressed the wrong soft key, driven by the force of habit. However, using the device for a week was enough for us to get the hang of the new allocation, owing to the simple fact that most leading phone manufactures use the same soft key order in their devices. The new soft keys in K850 are also a design decision, driven by the lack of space with the large display on pretty much the same dimensions as K810. We welcome this innovation by the Sony Ericsson team, which to us is an attempt to respond to users' demands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bit below the three soft keys are the brand new dual-function Call / Quick Menu key and Clear / End key, that make the phone handling even better. The dedicated Call and End keys, along with the tree soft keys and the D-pad novelties are inconsistent with the longstanding way of doing things, but take the K850 closer to the mass market. Under the Call and End keys is the keypad with the T650 cool styling, however the keys have grown bigger. The rightmost column of the alphanumeric keys serves a double purpose: in Camera mode they're used for changing the shooting mode, scene mode, self-timer and flash options. Icons with blue backlighting explain the function of each key. The D-pad can also be used for zooming in and out when taking pictures, while scrolling up or down on changes the exposure compensation. Most of the Sony Ericsson users out there would be happy to see that Sony Ericsson has again used the sleeker D-pad instead of a joystick. It's now a thin color plastic rectangle, placed right within the keypad and enfolding the 2 and 5 key. A bold and controversial design indeed, as most Sony Ericsson phones have a confirming center of the D-pad or a joystick. In K850, the Confirm function is entrusted to the middle soft key, right above the D-pad - another decision that raises doubts about user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 left side features no keys. Neat and simple, all you see is the color stripe that runs along the side parts of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the K850 features a digicam-like battery cover, which shelters the phone's battery, the SIM card, and the memory card slot. The latter deserves special attention since this is the first Sony Ericsson attempt at dual card support. Two cards are compatible with the slot: M2 and microSD. One is inserted face down, the other one face up, and both are hot-swappable. Apart from this, you will find the regular Fast Port, the mouthpiece and a wrist or neck strap eyelet. If you remove the SIM card in active phone mode, the phone will restart after a good delay and will start the demo mode. It would've been great if the phone was able to work in flight mode, without an inserted SIM. This drawback aside, handling the SIM, the memory card and the battery is effortless, thanks to the integrated push-to-eject mechanism. The same we see used in digicams nowadays. The design of the battery cover is a nice novelty, but we think it has one disadvantage. The lower end of the rear panel wobbles noticeably when typing on the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the device holds the On/Off key only, which can also be used for fast switching between the ringing profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Ericsson K850 immediately got our attention, as things there surely look like a regular digicam. Very close to the end key is a three-position button for switching between the camera modes - camera, video recorder, and preview mode. Right above it is the shutter key, and the adjacent smaller on/off camera key. There is no other mobile phone of the other leading manufacturers, except for the LG KU990 Viewty, which comes with such a bunch of dedicated camera keys. A convenient feature is that the on/off camera key is independent of the key lock. At the upper part of the right side we find the elevated V-shaped volume rocker, which also can be used for zooming when taking or browsing pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone over reveals an entirely flat monolith surface, only broken by the xenon flash and the camera lens ring, as well as the elongated grill of the loudspeaker. All of them are placed beneath the panel surface, so if you look at the phone sideways you will see no dimples or bulges on the back panel. Next to the lens cover stand two essential symbols - the Cyber-shot logo and the 5.0 megapixel sign. Below the lens is the Sony Ericsson logo. Where the monolith surface ends, you will see the tiny battery cover, with its rubber-like finishing, that is supposed to keep the phone firmly in your arm, or if laid on a tilted surface. Where the back panel ends, two delicate curves that slightly lift the phone can be spotted, a resourceful way to protect the sleek surface from scratches and dust. Another probable reason, given they're level with the loudspeaker, is an attempt to ensure some kind of a sound-screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 is powered by a Li-Poly BST-38 battery with a capacity of 930 mAh, a substitute for the standard BST-33 Li-Poly battery used in the other Cyber-shot handsets K550, K800 and K810. According to the manufacturer, the battery is capable of up to 400 hours of standby mode and up to 9 hours of talk time in GSM networks. Under very intensive usage, i.e. Bluetooth always on, 3G network, an hour of calls, an hour of media player, a good deal of trying the camera, gaming, browsing, etc., the battery hardly lasts for 36 hours. However, if used only in GSM networks and not excessively strained, the phone will last for a good 3, even 4 days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we're quite pleased with the ergonomics of the Sony Ericsson K850. It feels nice when held in hand and fits perfectly in your palm. The three soft keys, the dual Call and End keys, the D-pad do take the phone handling to a higher level. However, after due examination, a few shortcomings get exposed. The excellent response of the three sensor-like soft keys is in great contrasts with the angular hard-to-push D-pad, which but ruins the navigation experience. The confirming center soft key is too close to the D-pad up key. Simultaneous keypresses occur now and then, resulting in undesired confirmation of a function - for example in a delete contact dialog window, the center soft key corresponds to YES.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display enhanced<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were delighted with the Sony Ericsson K850 crystal clear display. It is a 262K-color TFT display with a QVGA resolution and has grown from 2" (in K810) to a 2.2" diagonal. In the world of numbers this is not a big deal, but it does matter in terms of display real estate. Furthermore, the display quality is tangibly improved in terms of both contrast and brightness. Dark colors are really dark. And that's verified: we compared it to the display of the same K810 we used in the previous review. Legibility in bright light conditions is another improvement, in comparison to the forerunner, going close to T650's level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the Sony Ericsson K850 offers square keys set sufficiently apart from each other, reminding of the keys of T650. This time they are made of rubber-like soft plastic and need more pressure when typing. You can hardly make any typos since the keys are wide apart. In our case, the keypad was evenly illuminated in blue as we were testing the Velvet Blue variety. With the added wave-like light effects it gains points on both usability and looks. Nicely, the D-pad is also illuminated in blue. The quality of the keyboard backlighting is just the same as in Sony Ericsson T650, again comparing with the handset we used in a recent review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>High level telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 is great at making and receiving calls. The loudspeaker is one of the loudest and crispest we've tested in a Sony Ericsson and you certainly wouldn't miss an incoming call even in noisy surroundings. It's excellent at bass and treble. This shouldn't surprise though, as the phone is media oriented too, featuring a Media Center with interface similar to Walkman 3.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cool user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K850 is the well known Sony Ericsson standard non-smartphone one, yet livened up with some refreshments and applications. The most important ones are the Media Center and the Flash Lite theme support, as well as the stylish light effects for incoming calls and the video ringtone support. As most previous models, the Sony Ericsson K850 comes with a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode. Unlike its Nokia S40 rivals, the Sony Ericsson handsets cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm due. Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a user-programmed feature or application. The main menu itself is a 4 x 3 grid of animated icons. All sub-menus are in list view with tiny icons on the left side. Response is fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like Sony Ericsson T650, the K850 also supports Flash Lite themes, even some of the preinstalled themes are Flash-based. They change not only the color scheme and the wallpaper, but also the menu icons themselves. We tested K850 with the default theme from T650 and sadly found out that the home screen animations didn't affect the keypad lighting in any way. We came to miss the captivating lighting effects of the T650. It is possible however that the lack of this functionality is only due to our handset being a pre-release unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Running Apps tab of the menu offers multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and listen to the radio or to the music player simultaneously. A new feature allows minimizing the dialog window when you receive a file via Bluetooth and opening the window on demand through the Running Apps tab on the Activity menu. This is really convenient, as now you can explore the phone in the meanwhile, as opposed to other Sony Ericsson phones, where you have to wait until the transfer completes. Strangely, this is not the case if you're sending files from K850 to another Bluetooth device. The two available options are "cancel" and "back" and both result in interrupting the file transfer. The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web menu and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of favorite features and can be modified to the user liking. The TrackID service is present here too, and is found in the My Shortcuts menu, in addition to its original location in the radio options menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: thank you soft keys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface has undergone several changes with the introduction of the three soft keys. Now, in contacts you can directly open any contact with the center soft key. The old More key is renamed Options and is now on the left side, while in old models, it was inevitably stuck in the right. The third soft key corresponds to "back". Another practical use of the middle soft key is the Send Message option, available when a contact is open and a number is highlighted. A new feature is the Smart Search, which lists all available contacts in the phonebook starting with the digits typed in the standby screen. The search engine looks for both a combination of letters in names and a phone number that starts with exactly the same digits entered. This function is well known in Windows Mobile based devices, and we even saw it in Samsung E950. Here in K850 it can also be switched off if not needed. Also present is the Send All Contacts option, that transfers the entire phonebook to another compatible Sony Ericsson device. Now, apart from sending the phonebook via Bluetooth, it is supposedly possible to transfer "as text message", "as picture", and "as email" too. However, we were unable to test these options, as they were "currently unavailable". We managed to successfully transfer a phone book of about 500 entries, each one with multiple numbers, emails and other data to a Sony Ericsson T650 in 7 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be default for the phonebook. Displaying both lists simultaneously is impossible. Otherwise, a nice option allows you to auto save to SIM any new contacts that you're saving in the phone memory. The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 5000 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are several phone number fields available: Mobile, Mobile (private), Mobile (work), Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contact. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, a custom ringtone and a voice command. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and set a reminder for it, which we found out to be a handy feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The maximum number of records is 30 altogether, shared between the separate tabs. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last call gets recorded.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the new enhancements are Manage Messages, Manage Email, plenty of settings for accounts, and assigning categories to messages. All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the shared Inbox. Only email messages have their own dedicated Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you may opt to sort messages to category list, if you previously had defined a specific category for each message. Six of them come preinstalled: Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important, but categories are fully customizable as well. If sorted by category, a big icon with an Inbox By Category tag appears instead of the standard small Inbox icon. Under it the categories are displayed, but only the ones with messages are shown, which is convenient. You can also delete all messages in a given category. However, there is a glitch in the system - in the general inbox there is no indication if a message has been assigned a category. The same holds true for messages that are opened. In an open message the applied category can be viewed or changed by pressing options -&gt; category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new thing is the Manage Messages application located in the Messaging section. It consists of three tabs. The first one is All Items, There's also an On Mem. Card and an In Phone tab, each including Drafts, Inbox, Outbox, Saved messages, and Sent messages folders. The options menu allows messages to be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact as well as other functions. Generally Manage Messages, together with Categories, offers wide-ranging customization options and improved message handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When typing a message, there is a character counter, which would alert you when you get close to the 160-symbol limit. The T9 dictionary goes without saying. Although the K850 has a standard phone keypad, its email client supports dozens of settings and all types of encodings, inherent to more complicated messaging devices. Again, for the email there is a separate Manage email application, with the same structure and features as the one for SMS, we've already discussed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: High five<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If we have to pinpoint the major novelty in the phone, it should be the Media Center. It is important enough to have a dedicated shortcut on the left soft key in standby. The interface, with its totally renovated dark-blue design, reminds of Sony PSP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media center menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, and Settings icons. The current pick is highlighted and the count of included files is displayed. The Media Center is also accessible through the sixth icon in the main menu. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto rotate screen orientation, thanks to the integrated motion senzor. It would've been nice to have at least a basic set of customizable features like, for example, sorting files according to their size. Anyway, if you're very particular about track order, you can always rely on custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 is equipped with Music Player 3.0, which is almost the same as the newly announced version 3.0 of the Walkman player to be seen in Sony Ericsson W910. The player supports MP3, AAC, and AAC+, E-AAC +, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats and sports the MegaBass equalizer preset. The player can naturally be set to run in the background. Sound is audible, crisp and even - as long you're using the player with a good headset, that is. Further on, the K850 comes with stylish light effects to make listening to music on the handset even more enjoyable. If you are not willing to use the media player step-by-step structure, you can directly play a file through the file manager with its classic flat tree structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player, previously found in the entertainment sector, is now accommodated in the media center as well. This time it supports fast-forwarding. The interface is simple but stylish, although it fails to impress from a functional point of view. Much like the W910, the Sony Ericsson K850 has a built-in motion sensor allowing the video player to auto rotate. Again, the video files are accessible via the file manager, but there you cannot opt to auto rotate the file according to the screen orientation, which we found a bit odd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third application in the Media Center is the Photo gallery. It consists of: Latest Photo, Camera Album, Photo Tags, Photo Feeds, and Pictures. Latest Photo provides quick access to most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year. When a month is open, it reveals a 4x3 grid of thumbs of photos. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month. The highlighted photo is a bit larger for a better browsing experience. The Pictures section opens again as a 4x3 grid of thumbs with non-camera images, as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a powerful tool for conveniently managing a vast collection of camera photos with great customization capabilities. Photo Tags is a new feature for displaying previously marked favorite photos. The Up key on the D-pad offers quick access to sending options like: send as Picture Msg, as email, to blog, via Bluetooth. Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. There is a new option called Pan and Zoom and an amazing slideshow revealed when you further scroll down the submenu. Pan and zoom is a menu shortcut to the familiar zoom view mode in other Sony Ericsson phones. Slideshows in K850 are just amazing - before they start you are asked to pick a mood and the handset plays the animated slide shows with background music to suit the chosen mood. The transition style of the slideshow also varies according to the mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but kind of pushed aside with the timeline view missing. This is quite a pity, having in mind, that T650 and K810 have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a photo in PhotoDJ is just the same nice experience with the available rich options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond. That would be useless though, especially given the available megapixel count. Extreme zooming in won't really reveal more details. All you'd get are smudged spots as a result of the interpolation. We were pleased to find that viewing images one by one didn't involve any lags at all. The high-res photo loaded immediately, which was not the case with picture browsing in K810 or T650. However, when you are zooming in your pictures the phone preloads a lower quality preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson K850 has memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: 5 megapixel Cyber-shot monster<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 has a thrilling 5 megapixel autofocus camera with a powerful xenon flash and automatic lens cover. Upgrades are serious in both interface and ergonomics. There's only one thing the Cyber-shot logo, the 5 megapixel sign and the digicam-like design and keys can't make up for. And that's a common drawback of all cameraphones: the lack of real quality optics. As the megapixel count in cameraphones will continue to go up, developing quality optics should be the first thing to address to give cameraphones some competitive edge against low and mid-end digicams. As to the interface, Sony Ericsson K850 is the first Sony Ericsson cameraphone to offer Cyber-shot SE v2.0, inspired by Sony's T series digital cameras. The major amendments are the pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons, or even embedded color photos, for even more intuitive performance, and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings. Autofocus mode automatically changes to macro, when a close object is chosen to shoot at and that's another handy option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a toolbar with options, including shooting mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, ISO, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most of the options are well known since K810, let's highlight the novelties only - the ISO sensitivity setting and the settings multi menu. The ISO setting is offered for the first time in a Cyber-shot handset. It allows the user to choose among four light sensitivity settings: auto, ISO 100, 200 and 400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings multi menu is the second new feature. It looks pretty much the same as in standard digicam menus. All the camera settings are displayed in two menu columns: the left displays the features and the right shows which setting is in use. Pressing the Down key of the D-pad lists all options of a certain feature. The settings on the menu are: Picture Quality, AF light, BestPic, Review, Stabilizer, Save to, Auto rotate, Shutter sound and Reset counter. Thankfully, taking photos with our K850 with the shutter sound switched off is possible. However, autofocusing is still marked by a confirmation beep, but as you already know, it can be muted by turning on silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 comes with a Photo Fix application, that provides quick remedy for some defects in the pictures. It is integrated into the camera interface, so a picture can be fixed right after it was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging the camera quality of a beta unit is a risky business. Even so, it's clear the K850 camera is a match for the release version of the camera in Nokia N95. This conclusion is based on our recently published in-depth shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This 5 megapixel head-to-head covered different shooting conditions for a thorough comparison. We welcome you to read it. We suppose the final version of the camera may perform better and we're ready to update the shootout if we see considerable improvements in its quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with K850 are captured in QVGA resolution at 30fps, not a big deal at all. Frankly, we expected at least VGA resolution at 30 fps. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences. It's about time Sony Ericsson upgraded the video recording capabilities of their mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 sample video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the secondary VGA camera is adequate. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen, while you view your own image in a small frame in the lower left corner. You can also have your image in mirror-like view, which is much more natural. 2x digital zoom in on your image is also available, as well as the option to replace your live video feed with a picture of your preference. You can also do that during an actual video call, and it's handy when, for example, you want to show the other party an interesting picture you've taken. The options don't end here. You can further control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into night mode. There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture, while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the full HSDPA (3.6 Mbps), 3G, EDGE and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and content-streaming, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as USB and Bluetooth with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is good enough and does more than an all-right job. It has plenty of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS. A new option for browsing sites is to use the pan &amp; zoom view mode, and it works much like zooming photos. There's a connectivity sub-menu added, where you can set the preferred connection, default page, or local connection. The NetFront web browser offers an RSS-feed reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser does well fitting the web content onto the screen. Scrolling is fast once the page has loaded completely. Our impression is that the Smart-fit function has got an upgrade and does a better job than the one in previous Sony Ericsson models. Other view options are shown below, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with the Human Interface Device (HID) profile, which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Furthermore, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for accessing the Internet on a PC or notebook computer. Bluetooth support also includes the A2DP profile, allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. The K850 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has three modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. The new one is the media transfer, which directly connects to the Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone, synchronization, play or sorting in playlists.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 offers many time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Light, Calculator, and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; T9 dictionary can be used here as well. The Light application let's you control the LED video light and use it as a flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you should have already seen. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. This can be a very entertaining, indeed. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for additional applications, the Sony Ericsson K850 comes with HP Print preinstalled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is only one game preinstalled in our test Sony Ericsson K850. Marble Madness 3D is a about guiding a ball through a 3D map by simply tilting and shaking the phone. It's motion-oriented game, making use of the handset's built-in motion sensor, and you may find it quite amusing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We believe the Sony Ericsson K850 lives up to the responsibility of being a landmark product in the company portfolio. With rich camera settings, the K850 comes incredibly close to stand-alone digital cameras. The novelties in navigation suggest the K850 will not resort to simply being an upgrade to older Cyber-shot handsets and will be aiming beyond the brand-loyal consumers. However, the first 5 megapixel Cyber-shot will be forced to handle a lot of pressure. It's been a year since Nokia N95 was introduced, which indisputably outruns K850 in non-cam features. Other tempting 5 megapixel mobiles as LG KU990, Samsung G600, Samsung F700, and Nokia N95 8GB will soon be crowding the cameraphone market. With an expected price tag of about 430 Euro, some users will think twice before buying a K850 at its very release. If the mentioned rival phones get launched at the same time, the domination of Sony Ericsson K850 will be put to a serious test.</paragraph>
