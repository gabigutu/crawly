			<paragraph>Already a magic word in the world of mobile phones, the Cyber-shot brand, has now received a new member. The Sony Ericsson K550 is a feature-rich cameraphone with an enjoyable 2 megapixel camera, nice imaging applications, FM radio and a memory card slot. And all that at a reasonable price that may attract your attention. Anyways, if we?ve managed to grab it, feel free to join us on a tour with the K800?s little brother.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Cyber-shot revolution has done only good to the Sony Ericsson sales. It proved rather successful and that is the reason why the manufacturer naturally releases a more affordable cameraphone to the masses. Sony Ericsson continue their long line of bar phones which are either camera or music-oriented with the K550. The midrange K-series continuation comes again in a small shell with a tight fit waist. At only 14 mm thickness, it surely packs in some nice features. So let?s continue with our review, but bear in mind that in the case of Sony Ericsson the Cyber-shot logo does not necessarily mean great camera performance but enhanced imaging capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K550 is going to be produced in two distinct versions. The first one is the K550i and the second one the K550im which is an i-mode version of the mobile and is the first i-mode phone by the manufacturer bearing that Cyber-shot logo. The test handset we received is in fact namely that i-mode version. It carries certain differences and as such those will be duly noted. Nevertheless, it gives us pretty much the full picture about the more widely-distributed would-be version ? K550i.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An impressive start<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K550 leaves nice impression at first sight. It measures 102 x 46 x 14 mm and weighs only 85 g. The handset design is styled with the new Sony Ericsson style ? circular navigation keys and thin metallic alphanumeric keys. This is obviously the design that is going to reign in the Sony Ericsson camp this year as we see it on almost all their latest bar-shaped mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The Sony Ericsson K550</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the 262K colors TFD display with a 176 x 220 pixels resolution there is only an in-call speaker grill and the Sony Ericsson brand name. The display itself has a silver rim all over which adds a certain stylishness to the design. Below the display there are the navigation keys which have a silver finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    In-call speaker ? keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device features a dual volume key and the regular Fast Port used for connecting the headset, the charger and the data cable. The port is indeed the regular one use by Sony Ericsson but is unusually positioned on the left side. In fact we saw that same solution in the Sony Ericsson W880. That is the same reason why the bottom side of the device is pretty bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The left side ? play/stop button ? Fast Port ? bottom side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side on the other hand accommodates an On/Off key and the Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The top side ? on/off button and infrared port</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the device features a camera shutter key and a dual volume key which serves the double purpose of zooming in and out when taking pictures or shooting video. There are also two small sliders which in fact lock the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The right side ? camera shutter ? volume/zoom buttons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone over reveals the active lens cover. Sliding it down activates the camera interface automatically. The active cover in fact covers not only the lens but also a self portrait mirror. Just beside the cover there are two powerful LEDs which serve the purpose of a photo flash as well as a flashlight when used with the Light application that is preinstalled in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The back panel: the active cover closed and opened</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you slide open the two sliders which lock the battery cover it is removed with an ease. This type of locking mechanism seems rather stable and secure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Removing the battery cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the cover is removed, the battery and the memory card slot are revealed. The battery is a standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Polymer with a capacity of 950mAh. There is no official information about how long the battery is supposed to endure, but our impression is that Sony Ericsson K550 does nice in that department. With a moderate use the fully charged battery was capable of enduring at least 4 days. The same battery in fact is used in Sony Ericsson W850 and W880.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Under the cover ? M2 card slot ? BST-33 Li-Po battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card bed is under the battery. It?s a regular Sony Ericsson one meaning that the SIM card is easy to slide in and hard to slide out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  SIM card bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we are pretty pleased with the design and construction of the Sony Ericsson K550. It feels nice to touch and fits perfectly in your hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Glass and metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K550 display is made using the TFD (thin film diode) technology. It offers TFT-like image quality but consumes far less power as low as the now obsolete STN displays which were used in the first days of the color mobile displays. The same display was used in Sony Ericsson K600, K608 and K610. TFD technology is not new and it's been around longer than TFT. Both feature an active matrix of pixels but when compared head-to-head TFD is known to show excessive brightness and contrast levels and inaccurate colors. Let?s just say that TFD would do just fine for those that are not that pretentious. Plus there?s the added advantage of longer battery life. The display performs well and remains almost perfectly visible under direct sunlight. We are happy with it and brightness levels don?t even need to be maxed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new keypad design adopted by Sony Ericsson in all their latest models ? those thin keys that seem almost hard to press in fact prove pretty comfortable to use. Keen message fans may get their fingers sore in the beginning, but we are happy with the keys feedback and even people with large fingers don?t have problems with them. The keys backlighting is blue and it?s rather strong and even. However, the two side soft keys for the messages and I-mode are not that good and do not offer the needed feedback when pressed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K550 does great at its main job ? making and receiving calls. Of course we wouldn?t expect any less than nice reception and signal strength from the K550. It met all other expectations too, since it played out its ringtones loud enough to be heard even in a noisy street, and the vibration is strong enough as well. The loudspeaker though has a problem with producing the high tones at the highest volume levels. They come out with hissing or buzzing. It must be noted that it lacks bass elements. But that?s really ok for a mobile phone.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: been there, done that<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K550 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. Honestly we?ve slowly becoming fed up with the user interface ? it?s been around for 2 years now. It offers great user-friendliness but new mobiles equipped with it don?t offer any new functionality over previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K550 has a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you are presented the option to start it directly into Flight mode. The phone cannot work in Flight mode unless there is a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. In fact when you start using the phone for the first time, the phone reminds you of that option. The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby view ? the main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several themes that come preinstalled in the phone. They change the color scheme, the wallpaper and sometimes even the menu icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Two of the preinstalled themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers real multi-tasking. It also offers quick access to recent events, the web menu and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The four tabs of the Activity menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice phonebook without a doubt<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. You can choose if the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone autosave to the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone?s memory. The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Contacts list ? Free memory status</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nothing new about messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages use one Inbox. Usually Sony Ericsson email messages have their own separate Inbox but due to our testing version being i-Mode enabled one, the emails also used the common Inbox. When writing a message, there is a character counter, which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Messaging menu ? Write new ? typing a SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in our test version was entirely i-mode oriented so we couldn?t try it since we didn?t have i-mode service available. The regular Sony Ericsson K550 should have also a RSS Reader application, but unfortunately the i-mode version doesn?t have one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing some sounds and videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K550 supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. The Music player is nothing special and looks just as your regular Sony Ericsson Walkman player used in the W-series of the Swedish manufacturer. The only difference is that it doesn?t feature the MegaBass equalizer preset. Since Sony Ericsson K550 supports multi-tasking, it can be set to run in background. Sound is nice ? given you use the player with a nice headset of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music player menu ? The Now playing screen ? player options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of K550 is basic and offers almost no special options. It can play videos in fullscreen landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has a memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Tuning in a station</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing some more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing new in the file browser department as well. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists ? one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the files shown. The integrated memory of the K550 is 77MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The phone memory tab ? available memory space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever ? you could do that in a list view with or without thumbnails. You can also view your pictures as a thumbnail grid of 2 x 2 or 3 x 3. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails. If you highlight a video thumbnail it starts playing as a preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 3 x 3 grid view ? 2 x 2 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about the file browser is the Timeline view, which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. That sort of image filtering is offered by computer picture browsers and digital cameras. The Timeline sorting is seen more and more often lately in the recent Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Applying a monthly filter ? applying a daily filter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves vertically (in portrait mode) just as you would on any other phone or horizontally (in landscape mode) if you prefer. When viewing the pictures one by one the phone preloads a lower quality preview in order to allow you fast browsing. Once you find a picture, you would like to see in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the pictures in landscape mode is much more natural</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Given the available megapixel count any zooming beyond 16x reveals nothing more but smudged spots which are way beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zooming in: 2x; 8x; 16x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures you can easily do a little bit of editing on them or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth and Infrared. If you intend to do detailed editing of the picture, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal. With its help you can easily adjust levels, light balance, brightness and contrast, remove unwanted red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture such as negative and sepia, or you can add a frame or a text to the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Some of the available editing options</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Cyber-shot branding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being part of the Cyber-shot family the K550 has naturally made us curious. The camera comes equipped with a 2 megapixel lens, auto focus, a two-LED flash, and an active lens cover which is used to start or shut down the camera application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera viewfinder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some camera menu options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K550 auto-focus didn?t prove itself as that much reliable but that may be due to the fact that our test phone is a beta version and not a final product. The auto-focus comes with a macro mode as an option which comes in handy when shooting closer objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K550 form factor and dimensions, the exotic resolution of 1632 x 1224 pixels, the autofocus and the dual LED flash initially made us believe that K550 has the same photo hardware we?ve already seen in K750, W800 and W810 models. We did expect the same kind of camera performance too. Then we noticed the fine print, the camera designation that?s it. It says the focal length is 3.8mm, while the focal length of the older models is 4.8mm. It seems that in order to fit in the thinner body, K550 has a smaller sensor, which is expected to produce lower quality pictures. Indeed, looking at the pictures, we see that the quality is comparable to W850/W880, and not to the popular K750/W800 autofocus models. Of course, our testing piece is a beta version and the photo quality may be improved in the retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                Camera samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Using the flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with K550 are captured at the low QCIF resolution. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences. It?s about time that Sony Ericsson upgrades the video recording capabilities of their mobile phones. Until that happens we will no longer publish sample video clips taken by Sony Ericsson phones ? there isn?t that much to see really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser doesn?t live up to the challenge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides GPRS and EDGE for fast data transfers, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as USB support, Infrared port and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a i-mode model, our test mobile's integrated Internet browser is a rather cut-down version which doesn?t have any special options ? you can?t view the pages fullscreen, you can?t even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. The web browser of even budget Sony Ericsson models is more advanced. The Smart-fit function of the browser seen on all previous models lacks as an explicit option here but seems to be turned on by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Browsing GSMArena.com ? the scarce browser options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K550 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with the Human Interface Device (HID) profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access of a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K550 has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes ? one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mark your tasks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily view. As we mentioned before, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar too. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options ? you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer menu ? Calendar *Alarms</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn?t have any limit in the duration of the recordings since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions with no bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Voice recorder ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ, VideoDJ and the Music Mate. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recording using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be a very amusing application. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A couple of fresh new games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two games preinstalled in our test Sony Ericsson K550 are new and we haven?t seen them on previous Sony Ericsson models. The first one is the Fruit Fall. You aim is to gather all the fruits of any given type in one place by rotating their enclosure. Once you gather all the fruits beside each other they disappear and that would ultimately lead to completing the level. The second game is a remake of the famous Worms game. This time it?s not about weapons and battles but about golf. The game is called Worms Golf ? and the aim here is simple too. Throw your grenade into the opponent?s hole with as little consecutive throws as possible. Both the games are amusing and offer a nice pastime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Fruit Fall ? Worms Golf</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well the Sony Ericsson K550 left us somewhat bewildered ? the Cyber-shot branding seems more of a marketing move than a new strong player in the cameraphones lineup. The camera shows nice performance but is yet incapable of outranking the Sony Ericsson K750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, summing it up, it seems as always, that if the price is right, the Sony Ericsson might just win the hearts of the fans. The decent camera, the memory card slot, the good battery life and the Flight mode are things that are not easily found in other midrange solutions. So, if you are looking for those, the Sony Ericsson might just be your next mobile gadget.</paragraph>
