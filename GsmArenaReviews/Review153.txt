			<paragraph>The sharp and compact BlackBerry Curve 8900 spells business and oozes with class. Easily the hottest looker in the Curve lineup - and possibly portfolio-wide - earns much respect as a massive functionality upgrade over its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distinct insider kind of charm of the BlackBerry handsets phases out into history as RIM are trying to take on the world and competitors with a new design language. OK, baptizing new converts was the Storm's job while the Curve 8900 seems the right stuff to inspire upgraders. Either way, we're happy to extend our BlackBerry streak and put the latest Curve through its paces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 8900 Curve doesn't pack the groundbreaking punch of its Storm sibling. Despite the fact that it upgrades the older generation of Curves quite painstakingly the whole user experience implies evolution rather than revolution. But then, that might just be the right approach from an upgrader's point of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, there's both Wi-Fi and GPS, which was until now impossible to have in a single BlackBerry Curve 83xx handset. The screen resolution is also more than doubled and the device has become quite slimmer and so much prettier. Now that sounds like a pretty solid foundation for success but still doesn't mean the Curve can afford to be complacent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User-friendliness and performance matter the most in reality and we know better than judging a phone before we have tested it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we're about to nudge the BlackBerry Curve 8900 awake and take it out for a spin. Care to join the ride?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>What's in the box?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 retail package is duly downgraded from what the Storm had to offer. The most notable omission is of course the 8GB memory card. The other thing left out is the cleaning cloth but that's fair - no huge touchscreen this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box still contains a microUSB cable and a DC charger with an appropriate adapter plug for both American and European voltage standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Storm, the Curve comes with a leather carrying pouch and a one-piece handsfree. The software CD and some leaflets go without saying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Curve 8900 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 109 x 60 x 13.5 mm and 110 g of weight the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is certainly a charmingly compact and pleasant-to-handle QWERTY device. The solid and sophisticated looks give the BlackBerry 8900 a real headstart and show the remarkable evolution the Curve series underwent in terms of design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a tough call between the latest Curve 8900 and Nokia E71 but we are quite certain we wouldn't mind having any of them in our pocket. As much as we like the Curve 8900 though, we have to admit it is all made of plastic. The metal used on E71 is a boost to both looks and durability. The price paid however is the significantly increased weight of 127 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, maybe the choice between full-touch and full QWERTY is not so painful in the BlackBerry world. We're still standing after the touch-based Storm swept through, so let's see what the Curve has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First thing on our list is checking how the Curve 8900 fares in terms of hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a QWERTY device, the BlackBerry 8900 Curve doesn't have too many surprises in stock in terms of form factor and design. The landscape screen of standard 4:3 aspect ratio and the full hardware keyboard are pretty non-negotiable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation deck built around the trademark trackball is no news either. We have to admit though that the design is greatly improved over the previous generation Curves. The phone looks a lot sleeker and quite more expensive now, in contrast to the pretty boring Curve 83xx handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the stylish front we find the earpiece and the proud BlackBerry logo. The LED status indicator is on their right side. In fact, this part of the front is an exact replica of the Storm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" TFT display is just below the earpiece. The thing to note here is that QVGA is no longer the norm in the Curve series. The Blackberry 8900 display has a resolution of 480 x 360 pixels. This beats most market rivals, like the Nokia E71 in terms of pixel density. Furthermore the display seems to have even better sunlight legibility than the Nokia business messenger, retaining more vivid colors when exposed to direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical BlackBerry layout of controls includes the two call keys, along with a back and menu buttons beneath the screen. The centerpiece there is a comfortable track ball, which is stunningly sharp in black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we get to the full QWERTY keyboard. It uses a four-row layout, the numpad accommodated on the left. All keys are of the same size, except for the space bar, and are incredibly tactile. The spacing between them is enough and their shape is very comfortable to use - convex with sloping edges - though probably not as good looking as on Nokia E71. Keys give very solid press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the BlackBerry 8900 Curve hosts one of the convenience keys. By default it functionality is set to starting the voice dialing but you can change that according to whatever works better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other such key is on the right side of the handset, below the volume rocker and the 3.5 mm standard audio jack. On the right side also you can find the microUSB slot that is also used for charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the BlackBerry 8900 Curve hides two keys - one for locking the phone and the other for muting it. At first sight you might miss those keys as the surface looks smooth and save for the two small icons there is no way you can tell there are keys underneath. Like we said, the top part of the handset repeats the Storm design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole is at the bottom, and it's the only element of interest there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The backside packs the 3.2 megapixel camera lens and the flash. The snapper low-light capabilities are supposed to be increased by this built-in LED but as usually it fails to make a big difference at distances greater than a meter. The loudspeaker grill is below the camera panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover lies the memory card slot, which is hot-swappable. You will have to remove the cover every time you want to replace it but at least you won't need to turn the phone on and off, saving yourselves quite a lot of time. But even if you need to do this often, the rear cover is easily removable upon a gentle push of the lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made entirely of plastic, thought thanks to the brushed finish it stylishly resembles the Blackberry Storm metal back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that the memory card slot can easily handle 16GB microSD cards which are the largest currently commercially available. Furthermore, much like the BlackBerry Storm, the Curve managed to scan and initialize a 16GB card in a few measly seconds, which raised a cheer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 8900 Curve is a very nice and handy device, and is compact enough for a QWERTY messenger. Even if the Curve is all plastic, it feels quite sturdy and can rival the higher-ranked BlackBerry 9000 Bold in terms of looks. Both the faux chrome frame and the faux brushed-aluminum rear are not the real thing but the phone still has the solid and sophisticated feel, which we appreciated in the Storm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS hasn't changed too much<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve runs on the proprietary BlackBerry OS v4.6. It comes across as quite a looker at first, just as we noted reviewing the BlackBerry Storm. The homescreen and the main menu have neat and simple, yet very appealing icons. On top of that, the main menu and the standby screen can be customized beyond recognition and look even more attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alas, you just can't do anything about the text-only submenus, which are more frequent than one might think on the Curve 8900. Some nice graphics there couldn't possibly have cost RIM too much and it's a pity they spared themselves the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might argue it's all hairsplitting here as the Curve 8900 target audience is less likely to be impressed by the eye-candy than functionality. That would be a point we guess but this shortcoming is still worth noting. After all you won't notice menus like that on Nokia E71, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry users will find their way around the Curve 8900 menu pretty easily but newcomers will need some time getting used to it. A nice example here would be the file manager, which is located in the media submenus. Not that big a deal though, and everyone is likely to get familiar with the landscape in a couple of days. But it will take quite some firmware upgrades to fix the basic looks of the deeper UI levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is pretty well organized with 6 (by default) shortcut buttons placed at the bottom and all status icons at the top.The profiles can also be accessed straight from here, as well as two other features that you choose to assign to the convenience keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally the main menu gets launched via the menu key. The BlackBerry Curve's interface is only operating in landscape mode as this is the display's default orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu navigation of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is somewhat different from what the competitors have to offer. Most other brands use soft-key based navigation where the available options for every menu item or feature are assigned to the context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve has the menu key in charge of all that and it's really a new experience if you're used to the soft key labels keeping all options in sight. Well, you may have to spend a bit longer studying the available features if you are a first time user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 has pretty decent performance with very few instances of lagging for the time of our review. The Storm had it much worse with submenu taking their time to open pretty often. We didn't experience any freezes either that would have made us reset the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it was obvious that the Storm interface wasn't up to the competitors' standard, passing a verdict on the Curve isn't just as easy. The Curve 8900 is a business device and the target audience isn't likely to hold the dreary looks of the deeper menu levels against it. That, we think, is the major shortcoming and luckily for the 8900 it isn't make or break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is what matters here and the Curve manages to deliver on that pretty well. The response is more than adequate so this here QWERTY fella won't be discriminated against based on its UI. Well actually, it won't draw the biggest cheer either but it sure gets things done.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook in need of refreshing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is one part of the interface of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 that won't get a wow out of users. Looks are very basic reminding us of older Windows Mobile versions but the virtually unlimited capacity and good organization make it a pretty decent performer. Still a new paintjob would have been welcomed and some extra functionality not completely inappropriate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically in one of those black and white lists that we warned you about. You can search a contact by gradually typing the desired name like on almost any other phone, only this time it's much faster and easier with the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you a vast number of fields which are organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields (those that you are going to need to anyway) as many times as you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: smart dial rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 performed well in its main duty - making calls. We didn't experience any problems with reception, or in-call sound quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that might be perfectly expected and doesn't bring any bonus points, the Smart dialing is certainly a great asset. With the QWERTY keyboard at hand you may never want to use your phonebook for dialing numbers again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do is punch a few keys on the homescreen and the names that have the typed letters will appear on the screen instantly. You can then select them with the trackball and initiate a call - it doesn't get any simpler than that, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 fared decently in our traditional loudspeaker test. It went away with a Good score, indicating a fairly low risk of missed calls though nothing outstanding. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging the BlackBerry way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. It also has the BlackBerry instant messenger preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve has a fairly simple and easy to use organization of the messaging department and all messages are composed through a common editor.There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down to for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emailing also has a remarkable set of customizable options, probably one of the best in business. However just out-of-the-box you can only set up BlackBerry Internet Service email accounts on the Curve 8900. This means that without a proper Blackberry service plan, the handset is just a plain no-email device. There are quite a lot of carriers globally that do not support BIS yet. But then again, you would hardly be buying a Blackberry device if you don't intend to use the Blackberry services.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conservative looks and decent functionality is what best describes the BlackBerry Curve 8900 music player. The business background of the device is the most probable reason for this and most users wouldn't have expected any different anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player sorts the music library automatically by artist, album and genre and you can search your tracks by gradual typing. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by activating one of the equalizer presets. Unfortunately, custom equalizers are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or through the main menu. There's no indication of the currently playing sng on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first audio quality test results that we ever saw by a Blackberry (namely Storm) were quite a nice surprise. Now that we've seen the results by Curve 8900, we guess RIM really know what they are doing when it comes to audio quality. The BlackBerry Curve 8900 isn't as good as the Storm but still has remarkable audio quality, performing well in every aspect of our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it wasn't for the cut-off bass the Curve would have easily ranked among the best sounding mobile phones on the market. This might have been done on purpose to conceal a potential weakness of the supplied headphones. However, with a 3.5mm standard audio jack on board you can easily replace them with almost any pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings are excellent with noise levels, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk particularly impressive. The distortions are also kept well within standards. All in all, you will be enjoying some great sound with BlackBerry Storm 8900. Business or not - this is a worthy achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Curve 8900 doesn't have as good frequency response as the Storm 9500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>This time they got the video player right<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Watching videos on the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is a generally pleasing experience. The screen cannot rival the 3.25" monster on the Storm but its higher pixel density and landscape orientation still provide for excellent quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can be set to work in fullscreen with the virtual buttons only appearing upon a key press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the Curve video player is that it comes with DivX and XviD support unlike its supposedly multimedia-oriented Storm sibling. MPEG-4 and WMV are also on board of course but we guess they won't be needed as much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All it takes to watch a movie on the Curve 8900 is upload it to the phone and start the video player - you get excellent compatibility and some of the better picture quality in business. That certainly is a good deal in our books.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is almost identical to the one found on the Storm. The main difference is of course the lack of touch operation but the functionality doesn't differ all that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery has standard functionality including thumbnail and list view of the images. We are particularly happy with the 100% zoom shortcut available in the menu when looking at a single picture. It gives you a quick and easy way to review photos in the finest detail possible. Further zoom steps are also available but why would anyone really need them?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally the photos can only be browsed in landscape mode. You can alternate photos without returning to the gallery view which is also pretty convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is decently fast and the zooming also seemed a bit faster than the Storm. However a tad faster than the Storm still qualifies as below average. We had no such problems with the panning though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera fails again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the Storm, BlackBerry Curve 8900 is equipped with a 3.15 MP autofocus camera and a LED flash. However the imaging capabilities of the device are pretty limited with usability, image quality and functionality all below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RIM got things wrong with the camera interface of the Curve just as much as they did with the Storm. A status bar is appearing at all times hiding a good portion of what actually ends up in the picture. This means that proper framing is next to impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI itself is pretty uncomfortable to work with as there are no shortcuts on the screen meaning that you have to dig in the menu to change settings. Not that there are too many settings you can apply, as those are quite limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glimmer of hope here is image-geotagging, which allows you to automatically record your location in the images EXIF data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few other offered settings are: white balance, color effects and image stabilization. There is also the obligatory picture size and quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What bothers us even more than the interface is the picture quality of the BlackBerry Curve 8900. It is well below the average performance in the 3MP league. The amount of resolved detail falls seriously short of impressive. Probably part of the explanation is the extremely aggressive noise reduction applied, which eradicates all fine detail and gives the photos a distinct oil-painting look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has a problem with corner softness, although not as bad as the Storm. The Curve 8900 images only tend to lose sharpness towards the left edge, the right one not nearly as bad. Contrast also seems somewhat better than the Storm but the dynamic range is below par. The color balance is generally a miss rather than a hit, although the phone manages to get them correctly on some of the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the sample photos so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the camera is one of the most disappointing parts of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 and we can hardly find anything good to say about it. Definitely not a nice deal for people interested in taking nice photos with their phone, the Curve 8900 might do the trick only if you use it to take photos for your phonebook. The only consolation here is that one of the main competitors of the Curve - Nokia E71 - has a camera that's almost as bad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording as bad as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you thought the camera had it bad, the video recording will sure leave you speechless. The best the BlackBerry Curve 8900 has to offer is 240 x 180 pixel videos, which is nothing short of disaster if we're talking full-featured video recording. Other than that, it might just do the trick for MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 3GP format and can have color effects applied. The LED flash can also be set to work as a video light. Like it matters?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It might be about time the guys over at RIM had a serious look at their handsets imaging capabilities and did something about it. At this point they may as well have never bothered putting a camera on the Curve - or any other handset for that matter. We guess a proper shooter from BlackBerry is yet to come.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: No 3G ruins the deal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is the area where a second BlackBerry in a row fails to convince. While the Curve 8900 got the Wi-Fi thing right it fails big time with the lack of 3G. A BlackBerry handset without a BlackBerry data plan is as good as a 100-buck phone so you normally have one when you purchase it. So it is hardly a smart move by RIM to force you to use EDGE only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming but lacks the 3G speed, not to mention HSDPA. While the Wi-Fi will certainly make up for the lack of it when a hot spot is around and is the far cheaper option when traveling abroad, it is by no means a complete alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving the wireless connectivity aside for a while the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is equipped with a standard microUSB port that is used both for connecting to a computer and for charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the mobile phone including your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM. You can even use the handset as a tethered modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Curve 8900 comes with Bluetooth v2.0 that also sports A2DP and a microSD data memory card slot. The latter means that if you have a card slot at hand you might achieve the fastest data transfer rates on this phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Thumbs up for the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of BlackBerry Curve 8900 is certainly one of the best we have seen among non-touch phones. A great combination of nice software, quick-QWERTY input and precise trackball navigation adding up to a combo that is hard to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The zoom is of course user configurable, even if not as easily as on the touch-enabled Storm. Panning is great thanks to the trackball and the virtual mouse cursor. You just push it towards the border of the page, et voila.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is near perfect displaying almost every page like on a computer. The high resolution display is another welcome bonus here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the only bad part about the web browser of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is the lack of Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handset provides great user experience when browsing the web, comparable only to the optical joystick-enabled Samsung handsets. Its inability to show Flash content however might tip the scales in favor of the competitors, like Nokia E71, even if they have somewhat clumsier navigation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-managing capabilities of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 are simply superb. Its organizer includes a good set of applications and although some of them are not quite the lookers, their usability is on a very decent level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but unluckily the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Furthermore, document editing is also supported right out of the box, unlike most competing phones. Unfortunately, there is no PDF viewer preinstalled so potential users will have to get one themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter as well as voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to only set one alarm, which fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze interval and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the BlackBerry Curve 8900 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of games aboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 8900 managed to surprise us by having no less than five games preinstalled. We didn't really expect to see many games on the Curve 8900, let alone more than what we had on the Storm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first two titles are already familiar from the Storm. They include a version of the all too popular Bricks game and Word Mole, where you have to compose words with the letters given on the board. We did find Word Mole quite amusing as it offers various bonuses and extra levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new games include Texas Hold'em King 2 which, as the name suggests, is a mobile version of the popular card game. The other two games are Sudoku and the Klondike solitaire. There's hardly anything to explain here as both of them are familiar enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Curve 8900 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. This means that voice-guided navigation is out of the question for the ones that buy it SIM free and then use it with their regular plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps provides basic map functionality plus voice-guided navigation. You can enter addresses straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Maps also allow you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bottom line: the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is less controversial than the TouchBerry Storm. It comes to update the Curve line and it does its job quite well. We guess only the missing 3G won't let us call the 8900 Curve the perfect upgrade. Anyway, on home Blackberry turf the Curve 8900 certainly holds a high position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to reaching outside the BlackBerry realm, the Curve 8900 does have the looks and some of the skill to try and earn new customers for the company. But the very concept of the closed BlackBerry ecosystem is a limitation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our case, the Curve 8900 is not a bad phone, but once the BlackBerry Internet Service account is out of the equation, it is much worse a deal than what the competitors can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E71 costs less than the Curve 8900 and puts HSDPA on the table. It also matches the document editing of the Curve and has the solid metal feel that some will sure prefer. While the lighter weight of the BlackBerry shouldn't be underestimated, the E71 is still the slimmest smartphone to-date and is by no means less pocketable, which makes it quite the better deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E71</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile QWERTY devices are also likely to be picked over the Curve 8900 for offering a much greater variety of 3rd party applications to choose from. While there certainly are a number of apps for the BlackBerry too, they are merely a drop in the bucket compared to the software available for WinMo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all in all, we're gonna leave pricing and features somewhat aside now. We guess the most important thing here is that - like all BlackBerries - the Curve 8900 is more the carrier's than the end user's type of phone. With that in mind, comparison with competing smart QWERTY messengers is not quite fair but in our humble reviewer's opinion it's not in favor of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 either.</paragraph>
