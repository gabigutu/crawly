			<paragraph>Standing out in the ever growing crowd of droids is a tall task indeed. Doing so while keeping the whole thing affordable, is next to impossible. HTC ? of all makers ? somehow managed to achieve it, vastly improving the market prospects of their ChaCha, aka the Facebook phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who would say no to a friendly smartphone with a thing for social networking? It takes a little blue button and we get the point, but the QWERTY keyboard is a statement of its own too. Facebook integration is said to be deeper than ever (and that's on Android 2.3 where it was just fine from the get-go).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you take Facebook out of the equation, the HTC ChaCha seems fit to tackle its rivals in the mid-range. Targeting the young, where heavy-texters are in no short supply, the QWERTY keyboard will earn itself quite a few fans. The quality metal finish makes for an upmarket look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side of things, you get the latest version of Android, 2.3.3 Gingerbread, and the latest release of the HTC home-brewed launcher, Sense. It all adds up to a pretty good combo, so if real-life performance spares us any nasty surprises, the ChaCha is well on target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let?s waste no more time and find out. We start, as usual, with the hardware checkup right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC ChaCha 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 114.4 x 64.6 x 10.7 mm, the HTC ChaCha is pleasingly compact, though hardly featherweight at 120 g. Some will certainly appreciate the solid feel that comes with the extra weight though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of the design decisions about the ChaCha are quite good. The company trademark chin, an ample amount of metal and a slim waistline seem like a pretty good start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we aren?t particularly fond of is the blank area between the QWERTY keyboard and the four touch-sensitive keys below the display. There seems to be plenty of unused space around the two Call knobs. They could?ve easily fit a bigger screen and the QWERTY keyboard is perfectly fine. A trackball was a brief wishful thought too since the white-clad ChaCha reminded us of the once popular HTC Hero. You don?t actually need it though, the arrow keys on the keyboard give you the needed precision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s just that the gap between the screen and keyboard doesn?t look good and is probably part of the reason why the ChaCha looks cheapish compared to the Nokia E6. It?s just that higher-end phones make better use of the available space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the HTC ChaCha looks pretty well put together and quite sturdy. We'd bet this one to last for quite a while even though we've only spent a couple of weeks with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has a 2.6" landscape display of HVGA resolution. There?s enough pixels for the modest diagonal so sharpness is not an issue really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nor is image quality: the ChaCha screen is as good as you might expect in this class. Of course, it won't match the AMOLEDs and Retinas of this world, but good luck getting those for the same kind of cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Against a more direct competitor, in Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510, the ChaCha has a clear advantage in terms of image quality even though it loses on screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha sunlight legibility isn't perfect, but it's nothing you cannot live with either. The screen remains legible in just about any weather, even if it loses some contrast. Once again, that's seems like more than you could realistically expect in such a device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also no sensitivity issues with the ChaCha touchscreen, so all-in-all we'd call the screen a solid performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our observations were confirmed by the results in our display test, where the ChaCha ranked closer to the best LCDs on the market than to its peers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The four-row QWERTY keyboard is the other highlight of the ChaCha front panel. With the chosen layout, the keyboard has dedicated keys for all the letters and some more frequently used symbols (comma, full stop, and question mark).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbers are located in the right half of the keyboard in a numpad layout, rather than occupying the top row. We are not sure this is the more comfortable solution for typing, but it certainly feels more natural when dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even managed to squeeze a set of arrow buttons in the bottom right corner of the keyboard. Those can be used for UI navigation and even the occasional app so we found them pretty useful. Especially for those into gaming and, seeing the ChaCha target audience, we believe most owners will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool touch about the keyboard is the camera button. It launches the camera and can then be used for taking photos too so it makes up for the lack of a dedicated shutter key. Of course this is not a two-position button, but with continuous autofocus it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general usability of the keyboard is pretty good too - key press is good and even though individual buttons aren't the biggest we have seen they are well spaced so we were able to type error-free at pretty good speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The rest of the controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sandwiched between the screen and the QWERTY keyboard, stand the HTC ChaCha six most important buttons. Those include four touch-sensitive Android keys - home, menu, back and search and the two regular buttons for call-handling purposes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the capacitive touch buttons really - they have the usual functionality including invoking the task switcher on holding the home button and starting voice search by holding the search key. However, we would like to give HTC a pat on the back for bringing back the call keys - those are really useful for those who actually talk a lot on their smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next interesting bit at the front is the Facebook button below the keyboard, which shows that this is not just an ordinary HTC. That button alone is a statement that may make some people purchase the ChaCha.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are on the homescreen, the Facebook button will let you quickly post to your wall upon short press or let you check in with Facebook Places when you hold it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are in an app, the button will try and post whatever it is you are looking at to your wall. So if you want to share a photo or an album that would be as simple as opening them in the gallery and clicking the Facebook button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tour of the ChaCha front panel concludes at its top, where we find the earpiece, the video-call camera and the proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha long and thin volume rocker is located at its left side, but we have to admit it's not the most comfortable control we have seen. Below it is the unprotected microUSB port, which also doubles as a charging slot. Needless to say that you are also free to charge the ChaCha off your computer and not just a power outlet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the ChaCha features nothing but the microphone pinhole, while the right side is perfectly bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top we find the 3.5mm audio jack, which has no protective cap of any kind and the power/screen lock key. Much like the volume rocker, this one is a bit on the flat and thin side so it's not the easiest thing to press, but you get used to it eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the HTC Chacha hosts the 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens and, either side of it, the loudspeaker grill and the LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To access the battery you slide the bottom half of the back panel downwards. It takes a lot of force before the part starts sliding, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Chacha battery life is quoted at up to 660 h of stand-by and up to 7 h 30 min of talk time. Those numbers may sound about average, but in reality the handset does way better than most droids - it lasted through almost 2 and a half days of some moderate to heavy usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the microSD card slot is located next to the battery and replacing the card without taking out the battery is impossible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI goes landscape(-ing)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha runs Android v2.3 out of the box. As usual, it is skinned with the HTC Sense, but a slightly different version. It's listed as ?version 2.1 for Messenger? but it packs a lot of goodies from the 3.0 release we saw on the HTC Sensation (the great lockscreen included).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video demonstration of the HTC ChaCha user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has been reworked to make better use of the landscape screen. There?re two virtual buttons available but they're visible only on the first homescreen. The left one opens the App launcher, while the right one brings up the "Personalize" menu. You can always tap the Home key to go back to the first homescreen (or you can do Menu key, All apps from any homescreen). Still, it's a bit annoying not having immediate access to the main menu from all screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on, which auto hides after a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is available on the ChaCha for easier navigation of homescreen panes. Tap the home key (while on the first homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. With a press and hold you can rearrange the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call keys also serve as shortcuts. The green one opens the call log just as you'd expect. The red one is a bit inconsistent: it will go to the homescreen most of the time but some times it won't (e.g. it doesn?t close the main menu). Still, it's a tactile alternative to the capacitive Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense makes use of Scenes ? essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes and you can get more scenes at the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and can set different colors to various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the ChaCha comes with only two skins pre-installed, but you can always get more off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout with vertically scrollable pages (just like we saw on the HTC Sensation), or you can switch to a list. You can use the keyboard to quickly find apps - just start typing the name and ChaCha will list matching apps instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has three tabs: All apps, Frequent apps and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven small homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are five different clocks. Picking a small version of a widget makes a lot of sense with the ChaCha. It doesn?t exactly have screen real estate to squander on large widgets, though truth be told, smaller widgets can be hard to read on a screen this small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Friend Stream widget for instance shows updates from the people you follow and lets you update status or tweet. The second version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets. A third one is also available showing only your friends? status updates with no option to update yours. There's nothing stopping you from using all of them, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is simplified compared to the one in Sense UI 3.0. It only lists the missed/ongoing events, there's no recent app list or an extra tab with power toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS and the like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t have high hopes for the ChaCha performance at first but when HTC announced that they will be upgrading it to an 800MHz processor (instead of the originally announced 600MHz), we made a note to benchmark it and see how it performs against similarly powered competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmarks showed the performance is what you'd expect from an old-gen single gen chipset running at 800MHz. Results were on par with the Samsung Galaxy Ace, whose relevant specs are identical, and ahead of the refreshed Wildfire S model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t have a matching set of benchmarks for the HTC Desire Z, but the much better BenchmarkPi results (2059 for the ChaCha and 1282 for the Froyo-running Z) show that having newer architecture is more important than pure clock speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new lockscreen that impressed us so much in the Sensation makes an appearance in the ChaCha too. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like. You can install other lockscreens too, each with a different function. You'll have to visit HTC Hub for that one though as the ChaCha comes with only one lockscreen preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled in the HTC ChaCha but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a website before shutting the down phone, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC has used some sort of Suspend or Hibernate logic as we know them from regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha has HTC?s excellent phonebook that combines everything from messaging and email to social network updates and online photo albums. It looks slightly different than what you're used to, mostly where things needed to fit the landscape screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it used conversation style view, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what make the ChaCha phonebook really great at social networking. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. A nice option is that you can filter contacts by where they came from - e.g. phone contacts or just the contacts from your Facebook account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. Linking a contact to their social networking account is the fastest way to add a lot of details - contact photos, birthdays and so on will be added automatically so you don?t have to enter them manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Transfer Data app is a good way to pull out your contacts from your old phone if they haven?t been synced with the cloud yet. It's a simple process of several steps (the app will tell you what to do). It's not a new trick (old Symbians did it ages ago) but it's still potentially very useful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with either signal strength or in-call quality on the ChaCha. It may not pack the strongest reception we have seen, but it's certainly good so nothing to worry about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha features red and green receiver keys, which is quite rare on smartphones these days. Still, we guess that most people will use these keys to answer a call or hang up and the touchscreen for everything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has both Voice dialing and Smart dialing - just start typing on the homescreen, either letters or numbers, and the dialer will find the contact for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC ChaCha fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Below average mark, which won't impress anyone ? and certainly not the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has QWERTY on its side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC ChaCha are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping on a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen, though that's still not much. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the HTC ChaCha is of course handled by the hardware QWERTY keyboard but you can have some assistance. You can enable text prediction, which serves reasonably well as a spell checker but won't save you many keystrokes by predicting the word you're trying to enter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha comes with not one but two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or conversations marked as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, priority, sender and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC ChaCha lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery handles online albums too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual list-with-thumbnail layout. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the screen there are three virtual buttons ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, one for Flickr. These two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC ChaCha is very easy ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Facebook is your primary target it's even easier - while viewing an album or a single photo, you can hit the Facebook button and ChaCha will offer to share that picture (or let you choose some photos from the current album) to share on Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC ChaCha image folders you can mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options - you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC ChaCha supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can also zoom with a simple double tap on the screen if you feel like it. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that the ChaCha displays the full-resolution photos in its gallery, rather than the downsized versions most of the droids in its class show.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good codec support, but limitations too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface on the HTC ChaCha offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through the video too. There are no subtitle, DLNA and SRS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - it handled most of the MP4, WMV and AVI (both DivX and XviD) files we threw at it, though it chocked on some. MKV files were a no-go - those are usually HD videos, which the ChaCha can't handle anyway, so no big loss here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolutions up to VGA or big files were no problem but files as small as 350MB failed to play, which really limits the number of things you can watch on the ChaCha (a typical DivX-encoded 45-minute episode is 350MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has no equalizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library layout is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other three tabs on the right, which are for Albums, Playlists and All Songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface lets you swipe over the album art to skip tracks back and forth in your current playlist. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. From the context menu, you can share a song (over Bluetooth, email or message) and you can set it as a ringtone. You can also look up the song on YouTube for the music video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's really missing here is an equalizer - the ChaCha offers nothing, not even a few presets. We realize it's not a music phone but still, an equalizer is something that modern phones should have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is slow to start, cool UI makes up for it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple, eye-pleasing interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and saves them in a list. Later, you can rename or delete those stations and add new ones too. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a young target audience like that, the ChaCha will often be used as a portable music player. That's why it was important that it did well in our audio quality test and luckily that was exactly the case. Of course, the HTC Facebook smartphone is no iPhone, but it does better than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier the achieved results are pretty good, except for the intermodulation distortion, which is a bit high for that scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is similar when headphones are connected - intermodulation distortion rises a bit higher. However, we are especially impressed by the stereo-crosstalk reading, which is among the lowest we have seen (with headphones plugged in, of course). Unfortunately, volume levels on both occasions are pretty low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sub-par 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha packs a 5MP camera for stills of up to 2592x1952 pixel resolution. The phone does D1 (720x480) videos @ 24fps too. There?s a single-LED flash, which can also be used as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nearly identical to that of other HTC phones with minor differences. There's a virtual shutter key at the bottom of the screen and a zoom slider on the left. On the right you get four controls - the still/video mode toggle, back/front camera toggle, flash settings and a shortcut to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the effects key - you can access those using the menu key and you'll find all sorts of other settings there (ISO, image adjustments, etc.). The ChaCha also has fancy features like face detection, touch focus and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus lets the camera focus as you reframe ? quite useful given the ChaCha doesn?t have a proper half-press enabled shutter key and you can?t do that with the virtual shutter key either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A particularly nice touch is the option to automatically upload all your photos to your Facebook account and use that as a backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We weren't expecting miracles from the ChaCha camera and we didn?t get any. There's visible noise despite very little fine detail making it past the post processing stage. Most annoying however is the massive pink spot dead center, which basically alters the color balance of the entire photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not to mention the lens issue that our ChaCha unit had - it's not the first time we've seen this in HTC phones and it's a worrisome trend. On the other hand ? the original Samsung Galaxy S has one too though not as prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is fine for what that's worth but you might want to process the images to fix the colors anyway. And watch out for lens issues when buying a ChaCha.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the camera samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you haven't seen a pink spot before, check out the first chart - that's supposed to be black lines on white paper. The second chart shows off the contrast (look at the squares around the central circle), which seems to be one of the best characteristics of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The squares to the right (especially the one next to the grass and gravel squares) highlight how aggressive the noise reduction is. The third chart once again highlights just how far off the ChaCha is when it comes to color reproduction.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As you can see for yourself the ChaCha camera falls behind most of its competitors and will surely not satisfy the average user. As we said above the biggest problem we met is the unsatisfactory captured detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>D1 videos with frame rate issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s, though understandably, there aren't as many customizable options. You can set the video resolution, white balance, exposure, saturation, contrast and you can even add effects. Audio recording is optional, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but you will need to activate it manually. The ChaCha normally focuses before you start shooting a video and locks the focus, but a tap on any part of the screen will make it refocus, while shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in 3GP format and while that's not our first choice for a video container, it should be good enough for D1 video. The amount of captured detail is pretty good but the ChaCha struggles to maintain 22-23fps rather than the intended 30fps and that ruins the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cars in our sample appear to leap frog - they go for a while then freeze for a few frames and then start again. We were hoping that the beefed up CPU will prevent such issues but it turns out it won't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched D1@20fps video clip (18s, 7.5MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you can check out this sample we uploaded to YouTube to see the level of choppiness that spoils the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has a commendable connectivity set, including quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G (7.2Mbps downlink and 384kbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n (no DLNA here though). The Bluetooth version is 3.0, but you should not expect high-speed transfers either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in the microUSB cable you?re presented with a long list of options - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable only ?allowed users? to connect or leave it open for anything (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good web browsing, but Flash is a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser, which does bring some advantages over Froyo, but full Flash support isn't one of them in this case. The small screen also puts a limit on the browsing experience. It does have decent pixel density going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up (they along with the URL bar cover almost the entire screen, which is a bit annoying).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out yet more options ? anything from finding on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha browser also supports pinch/double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes it easier to even read texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha comes only with basic Flash support courtesy of HTC. It manages to play YouTube videos inline but it uses the 240p stream, which is intended for underpowered feature phones and is very heavily compressed. You can't switch to the 360p version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could always use the YouTube app, but Flash games are out of reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Usual organizer stuff plus Office doc editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy thanks to the keyboard, though the Calendar feels a bit cramped on the tiny screen. You can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice isn't preinstalled on the HTC ChaCha but you can download it for free from the HTC Hub. Surprisingly, it wasn?t the viewer-only option but the full-blown editor that can view and edit Work and Excel files. Viewing PowerPoint files is supported too, but not editing them. QuickOffice can also handle Office 2007 files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed isn't blazing (zooming in particular takes just over a second) but panning is rather fast and smooth and entering text is fast enough. The ChaCha isn't the best business phone, but it's certainly not shy around Office work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard, which uses a virtual on-screen keypad though you can use the hardware keyboard too. Still, all you get is one line of the screen for your calculations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your ChaCha into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more app worth mentioning - the Quick lookup search app. It lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatted for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has quite a bit of Facebook branding but so far we haven?t really seen anything exclusive to the ChaCha in terms of software (aside from the handy functions of the Facebook button, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChaCha comes with the standard Facebook app preloaded, so nothing exclusive on that front either. Still, the official app handles all the functionality of Facebook and receives regular updates, so it's enough we suppose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into places, like Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a separate Facebook Chat app, which doubles the functionality available in the full Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the app can be used in conjunction with the excellent SNS-savvy phone book, but again, it's the same as what you normally get from an HTC droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one Twitter app that comes preinstalled on the ChaCha ? HTC?s Peep. No worries though, it does a very good job, but in case you don?t like it, you can always download another app from the Market, including the official one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). Searching the Market is easy - you just type in the query on the keyboard and hit enter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low-res landscape screen limits the compatibility with some apps however. The vastly predominant portrait orientation means that not all devs will make sure their apps work properly in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to browse for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Marked items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market but it presents them using a fancier user itnerface. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins, along with sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories). Several apps have made their way into Hub too - including Teeter, Ringtone trimmer and the Quickoffice app (they are free).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free. The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the ChaCha in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigate the Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Navigation is also on board and can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha is a likable little fella - with a good screen, a comfortable keyboard and a compact and slim metal body, its charm is hard to resist. Now add the deep Facebook integration, where you can share everything with the click of that magic blue button and you know SNS fans will be getting good value for their money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the ChaCha is certainly not perfect - those into gaming might appreciate the arrow keys, but the low processing power is bound to steer them away from the ChaCha, while those that like to web browse on the go might be turned down by the lack of proper Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, not being the ultimate device in this or that category is not a huge problem for the HTC ChaCha. You see, no one expects a mid-range device to top the charts, so the fact that the ChaCha is one of the best SNS devices makes it more of an over-, than an underachiever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What might come to hamper the ChaCha market prospects thought is the more powerful hardware available for a similar price. At about 270 euro we wouldn?t call the HTC smartphone overpriced, but the thing is Android smartphones have been pushing the market pricing down for quite some time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s why you are now able to purchase a Super AMOLED-packing Samsung I9000 Galaxy S for about the same asking price. And it not only does Flash, but it even plays 720p Flash video in the browser after its Gingerbread update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the QWERTY keyboard is a must, you may get HTC?s own Desire Z or the Motorola Milestone 2, which offer a large slide-out unit, which permits even higher typing speed. You will have to carry a significantly heavier device if you decide to go that way though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire Z ? Motorola Milestone 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handset to consider is the Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510. It?s lower spec?d than the ChaCha (the main difference being the screen resolution), but if Samsung get the pricing right, it might be a viable alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of those handsets however has the Facebook button of the ChaCha, which is probably the reason you are reading this review in the first place. Being able to share your content at the expense of a single click is a unique feature and should certainly be worth a few extra bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in conclusion, we?d give the ChaCha the GSMArena thumbs up, as long as HTC agrees to cut down on its price a bit more. It?s how the market works and we are sure that an experienced player like HTC will play by the rules and deliver on our expectations.</paragraph>
