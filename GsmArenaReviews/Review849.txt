			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the best Sony's got. The Xperia X Performance is the chosen one to fly the banner of Sony's revamped smartphone lineup. The top of the range, the Deus ex machina, the one to make you forget about your ex - the Z-series. Or is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance packs Qualcomm's top-end chipset of the season. It's also got a premium price tag but Sony is a premium brand to begin with and going 2 notches up or down the alphabet weren't going to change that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the 2016 flagships have more RAM, more and more of them have higher-res screens, and most can do 2160p video, if nothing else it's future-proofing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, stereo speakers aren't too widespread among the competition and water-proofing is even harder to get - both boxes checked on the Xperia X Performance spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So we have a rare breed of flagship on our hands. It's priced as a flagship and it has one or two features that few other flagships have, yet it doesn't strive to beat everybody else in their specs race. We sure don't know what to make of it but we bet that some further digging might show us what it's all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The absence of 4K video recording from the spec sheet is baffling. The only plausible explanation is that Sony is reserving it for an even higher-end model further down the line. But even so, the Xperia X Performance commands a flagship price, and yet it's missing a feature that's taken for granted in its segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The omission of fingerprint recognition for the US is an odd decision too, and one that probably has its roots in licensing and such, so we won't ponder on it too much, and let Sony deal with disgruntled US buyers. Of course, it's easier for us to dismiss it - our review unit (international version) comes with all the trimmings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X Performance pricing is certainly ambitious, but Sony's name alone commands a price premium across their entire product portfolios. Brand loyalty is strong with the Japanese company too, and that's something you build with successful products over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's see whether the Xperia X Performance has what it takes to carry the brand's banner forward. Join us on the next page for a detailed look at the X Performance's exterior.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance arrives in what appears to be a plain white box with the logo printed on top. The colors are on the inside though, a pleasant surprise for the unsuspecting buyer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review unit came with just a USB cable and a charger, a basic 5V/1.5A unit. We were told that our package contents aren't representative of the market bundle, and indeed there's room in the box for headphones too. Whether the Sony UCH10 Quick Charger will be included is a region-dependent decision as well and may even differ from supplier to supplier so make sure you reasearch what you'll find in your particular box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia X Performance 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance measures 143.7 x 70.4 x 8.7mm, which is about a millimeter more in each direction than the Xperia X's dimensions. There aren't many 5-inch flagships left, but the Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, manages to fit its marginally larger 5.1-inch display in an overall smaller package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's on the heavy side too, the X Performance, tipping the scales at 165g. The comparison to the Samsung top-model is again not in Sony's favor - the S7 is 13g lighter, while packing a 3,000mAh battery as opposed to the 2,700mAh that powers the Performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Have an Xperia X and an Xperia X Performance side by side, and there's hardly a person outside of Sony's design department that will be able to tell their fronts apart. The Xperia X Performance is a millimeter larger in every direction but try spotting that in real life. The difference however is easily felt when you hold both models in your hands - the X Performance is thicker and heavier even though both phones have the same screen diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resemblance to the flagship model is surely a bonus point for the Xperia X but we're not quite sure it works the other way around too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair here, we'll only mention that only the X Performance has the more premium brushed metal finish on the back on the gray and silver models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has always had a particular liking for the simplicity of the rectangle, corners ever so slightly rounded. The Xperia X Performance favors subtlety in design, but adds a premium touch with a curved 2.5D display glass that is a joy to swipe away at. It's scratch-resistant too, though Sony doesn't seem too keen on working with Corning, and it's not Gorilla Glass-branded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is clearly a descendant of the original Xperia Z, a design refined and polished over generations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, it looks like it's the Xperia Z3 that the X Performance seems to share most of its genes with - but that may be just us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The similarity is most obvious in the two slits above and below the display, which house the stereo speakers. The top one also integrates the status LED, keeping it from spoiling the relatively clean top bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already stated, it's the back where the Xperia X Performance differs from the vanilla Xperia X. The panels on the Graphite Black and White options have a brushed finish, while the Rose Gold and Lime Gold variants get a finer satin surface. Regardless of color and finish, the panels are all made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The White model is our top pick, the black one being a touch too generic, and the two shades of gold...well, let's say we're obviously not the right demographic for those colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we say 'White', it means only the front, the rear is more like what you could call 'Silver' or 'Stainless steel' - if you're willing to excuse your color-vocabulary-challenged writer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is in its usual position in the top left corner, the single LED flash below it. There's a ring around the lens to serve more as a design element, rather than protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In an odd turn of events, the frame on the Xperia X Performance, like on the Xperia X, is made of polycarbonate, contrary to what you may have assumed considering the market segments these two smartphones occupy. There's likely a reason for that, be it radio signal reception, assembly considerations, durability or otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of stuff going on all around the frame. The right side is the busiest, holding all of the controls. The Power button/Fingerprint reader is the centerpiece, by significance and location alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reader is fast and accurate, but it may not be equally comfortable to use with either hand. Whether you're a leftie, of just prefer to use your smartphone with the left hand, unlocking with the left forefinger doesn't feel as natural as with the right thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other less than ideal bit about the Xperia X Performance's control layout is the low position of the volume rocker. Using it requires a major readjustment of your grip, which makes for a potential dropping hazard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware two-step camera shutter release button is a rarity outside of the Sony lineup. Here, it has the added benefit of launching the camera and taking a shot in as little as 0.6s. Sony claims this is way faster than even the Xperia Z5 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we don't quite like about this concept is that when taking a picture before the screen is even on means framing is almost always bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side is the card tray that now gets pulled out together with the flap, which has rubber lining to ensure no water or dust enter the phone. Sony phones don't like having their SIM cards taken out without warning and restart immediately once you take out the tray. Then once again, when you insert it back in. And with the tray shared between SIM and microSD cards, the same will happen if you want to replace the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have got to note that on the Dual SIM model of the Xperia X Performance - the slot is actually of the Hybdird type that allows a combination of either two SIM cards or a SIM card and a microSD card. This solution has been getting quite popular lately on phones by other brands but this is perhaps the first time we see Sony utilize it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack and a secondary mic pinhole. A standard-issue microUSB 2.0 port is on the bottom - Sony's not yet ready to make the jump to Type-C connectivity yet - not that we're overeager either. The primary mic is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hand the Sony Xperia X Performance feels heavy and expensive. Thanks to its flat panels there isn't the subjective effect of thinning towards the side edges like the Galaxy S7 for example. The upside to this is that the sides give plenty of area for your fingers to secure a tight grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also gave us samples of the accessory cases that will be available for the Xperia X Performance - all members of the Style Cover family. All except the SBC 20 are made of soft faux leather in the same selection of colors, as are available for the phone itself. They all leave the fingerprint sensor exposed, but do cover the other buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Style Cover Touch (SCR56) is the smartest of the bunch if you could call a case that. Its front is not leather, but frosted plastic instead, so it's relatively transparent with the premise to allow you to use the phone without flipping the cover open. You pair the phone with the cover via NFC and an icon in the app drawer pops up where you can enable the cover's only option - to boost the screen brightness when it's closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Style Cover Flip is similar, minus the transparency - so it's basically a flip cover with no brains. Flipping it open does wake up the phone, so there's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Style Cover SBC30 is a bumper case which protects the back and the sides, leaving the display unobstructed (unprotected too). The SBC20 does the same, but is made of clear silicone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-class 5-inch FullHD IPS display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance has a 5-inch FullHD dislpay of 441ppi. There's a host of proprietary technologies on board. Triluminous is Sony's trademark for what is essentially a Quantum dot display, a variation of LCD panels that delivers a wider color gamut. The X-reality engine dynamically enhances images and video to provide higher contrast and improved sharpness when viewing multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>600 nits of brightness Sony claimed, and our tests very much confirm that it is indeed possible when Adaptive brightness is enabled and the phone is exposed to bright sunlight. High brightness and deep blacks make for excellent contrast in the 1500:1 ballpark, regardless of auto on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness is about the same as on the Xperia Z5 but the screen's contrast ratio has definitely been improved and by a wide margin at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color reproduction is fairly accurate, with an average DeltaE of 5.7, similar to the LG G5's 5.6, and better than the Huawei P9 (7.4) and Samsung Galaxy S7 (7.1) in their default modes. A common feature of Sony displays, the bluish whites seem to be here to stay but you won't really notice it unless you have a reference. Overall, it's unlikely to bother you unless you need perfect color reproduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A high-quality IPS panel, the Xperia X Performance's display does very well in the sunlight too. It's not in AMOLED territory, but is one of the better LCD's in this respect, according to our tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance is well stocked on connectivity options. Our review unit is the single-SIM version (F8131 model name), but there's also a dual-SIM one (F8132). The slot in that case is of the hybrid variety though - it's either a second SIM or a microSD card - you can't have all three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LTE Cat. 9 (450Mbps down, 50Mbps up) is an upgrade over the Xperia X's Cat6. Sony also states that signal reception has gotten 25% more stable than on the Z5 - with better call quality and data throughput at any given distance from the cell tower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also comes equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas. Local connectivity goes on with Bluetooth 4.2 with aptX and Low Energy, and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi connection can be used for screen casting - either via Miracast or Google Cast. If you connect a DualShock controller, the Xperia X Performance can become a portable console. It can also connect to your car's stereo system via MirrorLink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port lets you charge the phone as well as hook up USB storage and accessories. You'll need to select the data transfer mode every time you connect it to a PC, as it defaults to charge only. Sony has dropped MHL support, so you have no wired way to output an image to a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance has no FM radio though, which the plain Xperia X offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia X Performance battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance is powered by a 2,700mAh battery - a modest 80mAh boost over the Xperia X. Last year's Xperia Z5 had a 2,900mAh cell, but a larger 5.2-inch display, while the Xperia Z5 Compact stood at 4.6 inches and 2,700mAh. It looks like Sony isn't too keen on putting excessively large batteries, focusing on efficiency instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Premium FullHD 5-inchers with top notch chipsets aren't too common anymore to make a direct comparison. The Huawei P9 has the same resolution as the X Performance, but on a marginally larger diagonal (5.2") and Huawei has fitted a 3,000mAh battery inside. The same goes for the Xiaomi Mi 5 if you round up its 5.15-inch diagonal. Then again the 5.2-inch FullHD Nexus 5X also relies on a 2,700mAh capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QHD screen resolution camp is represented by the Samsung Galaxy S7 (5.1"), the HTC 10 (5.2") and the LG G5 (5.3"), which all have similar screen sizes. The first two are powered by 3,000mAh batteries, with the G5, which has the largest screen in the group, packing the smallest battery (2,800mAh).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Capacity and screen area alone don't tell us the full story though, that's why we have our own tests. Well, we carried them out on the Xperia X Performance and the results are in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance shows a balanced performance in all our tests with average to good results across the board. The smartphone made it just short of 21 hours on a 3G voice call, around 7 and half hours browsing the web over Wi-Fi and a little more than 8 hours in video playback. The fact that its numbers are so consistent shows that it simply could have benefited from a larger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What that means is that the Xperia X Performance will last you about 2 hours less than the plain X in both screen-on tests. With the displays being identical, we'd guess the powerful Snapdragon 820 is also more power-hungry, at least more so than the S650 found in the Xperia X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick flagship comparison reveals that the Xperia X Performance is tied with the HTC in voice calls, both comfortably ahead of the G5 (17:37) and the P9 (14:53h).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the web browsing department, the Xperia X is the one that dies first, but the G5's 12 minutes more don't make a world of difference. Only the Mi 5 goes into double-digit hours (okay, well into double-digit hours at 12:50).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bit more of the same for the Xperia X Performance in the video playback test, where it ends up last in the flagship short list. The Huawei P9 (8:46h) and HTC 10 (8:42) don't fare any better, and the Galaxy S7 is the clear winner here (14:50h).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the Xperia X Performance supports Quick Charge 2.0. Strangely, it's not the latest Quick Charge 3.0 seen on the other flagship phones with the Snapdragon 820 but perhaps the reason for that is another new technology the phone comes equipped with. The Xperia X Performance comes with the Qnovo adaptive technology for smart control of the battery charging process much like the rest of the phones in Sony's current smartphone generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qnovo's technology monitors the cell's electrochemical processes in real-time, allowing for minimizing of cell damage and extending the battery lifespan. Qnovo claims the battery should last hundreds of charge cycles more than a conventionally charged battery. This means a year or two of extra longevity and if the battery ages better it will hopefully be able to hold charge better down the line (and this is potentially important for a phone that has its battery sealed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Stamina battery saving feature also comes standard here. It has two modes: regular Stamina, and Ultra Stamina. The first disables non-essential features like GPS and vibration, and takes performance down a notch, but the Xperia does remain a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultra Stamina is for absolutely dire occasions when you don't expect to be able to find a power outlet for a prolonged period of time. Enable that and it's back to basics where you get a single homescreen with access to the dialer and contacts, text messages, camera and clock.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Marshmallow with a dash of Xperia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's new X line of smartphones comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box. As usual, a few proprietary apps and features are baked in as well, but the company's always had a light touch when it comes to modding Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind we use "light" in terms of the number of changes it makes, not how much storage it uses up. The X Performance is available with 32GB or 64GB of internal memory of which you're left with either 20GB or 48.6GB. On the positive side, if you need more storage, you can always add a microSD card unlike with many of the phone's competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader is a recent addition to the Xperia line and Sony firmly believes the best place for it is on the side, integrated into the Power button. We can't deny the convenience, as waking the screen and unlocking the phone are tightly related. It just isn't equally well suited to use with both hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Lock gives you conditional security - trusted nearby devices, locations, faces, or voices can allow you to skip the security unlock protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's optional double-tap-to-wake if you just need to check notifications (there's a notification LED in the top loudspeaker too). Then there's double-tap-to-sleep, so you can send the phone to standby by tapping on an empty area. If you're in a fullscreen app, tapping on the notification bar won't do it though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the first feature is in the display settings, the second - in the homescreen settings. While there's clearly a logic behind such an arrangement, perhaps the best logic would be to have the two in one place, maybe?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a good experience with the fingerprint reader. It's fast and fairly accurate. There's an animation that slides the lockscreen away from your thumb (as if you pushed it out of the way), which helps hide the small delay, so it feels seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same animation that's played when you unlock with an upward swipe if you're not using any form of lockscreen security - it's a bit disconcerting to swipe up but have the lockscreen fade out to the left. You also can't swipe right to unlock - it's either left or up. We feel Sony could have worked a bit more on the user-friendliness of this interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen appears unchanged. This includes the swipe down gesture, which shows a screen of the apps you use most along with recommendations for new apps to install. A search field is highlighted so you can start typing the app's name immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional app drawer is still on board and it features an above average amount of vendor apps. Sony takes great pride in their AV prowess, so there is now way that they could have gone for the stock multimedia apps made by Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available (both free and paid) that can customize the look and sound of the Xperia X Performance UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is plain Android. You can re-arrange the quick toggle tiles and adjust the screen brightness. Note that just like in vanilla Android, there's no toggle for Auto brightness (you need to go into the settings for that). That's the one thing we don't mind skins changing and still, many manufacturers like to keep it stock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher is similarly a vanilla Android affair with the 3D rolodex look. The small apps are gone, however, and there is no longer floating app multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What there is, is screen pinning, which locks the display on the current app, blocks incoming calls and prevents other apps from retrieving your location. You can think of it as a Toddler mode. To get out of it simply press and hold the back and recent apps keys simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart cleaner feature will periodically empty the cache of apps you haven't used in a while. You can switch this off or just manually tell it not to bother for certain apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing Android has been missing for years is a proper backup solution and Sony gives you one. It can backup applications, contacts, messages, phone settings. The backup info itself can be stored on your Sony online account, on the microSD card or an external USB device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backups can be scheduled, including conditions like "Connected to Wi-Fi" and "Charging device", depending on your preferences.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance is the top dog in Sony's X-series and as such, it gets Qualcomm's most powerful chipset available - the Snapdragon 820. The SoC of choice for many of this year's flagships can be found in the LG G5, some versions of the Galaxy S7 / S7 edge, and the HTC 10, to name the most prominent ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of them have 4GB of RAM, while the Xperia X Performance makes do with just 3GB. "Just" as in not necessarily insufficient, but rather not quite in tune with the competition. We'll have to investigate whether this deficiency would show through in benchmarks scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had all those at the office already, plus the Xiaomi Mi 5 and the LeEco Le Max 2, so we have a pretty accurate notion of what to expect from the top-end Snapdragon. Indeed, the Xperia X Performance typically scores in the same ballpark as other models with the Qualcomm chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've thrown some alternatively-powered flagships into the fight, too: the Galaxy S7 (Exynos 8890 chipset) Huawei P9 (Kirin 955), Mate 8 (Kirin 950), Meizu Pro 6 (Helio X25), Pro 5 (Exynos 7420), as well last year's Xperia Z5 (Snapdragon 810).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics - raw CPU power. In single-core GeekBench the Xperia X Performance is the lowest-ranking of the big-name Snapdragon 820 models, but the differences are marginal at best - the HTC has the highest-scoring Kryo core here, by a whopping 4%. A single Twister core in the Apple A9 chipset is still leading the flagship pack, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance does a better job putting all cores to work. In the GeekBench multi-core test it outpaces all other Snapdragon 820's - admittedly, by a very small margin. There is, however, a very wide gap between Sony's flagship and non-Qualcomm rivals - the Kirin 955 tops this chart, inside the Huawei P9, followed by the Helio X25 (using the Pro 6 as a vehicle). The Galaxy S7's Exynos 8890 is also comfortably ahead of the Xperia X Perfomance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark II 2.0 adds RAM and storage tests on top of CPU ones to give a better indication of overall performance. The Xperia X Performance posts excellent numbers neck and neck with the Xiaomi Mi 5. Kirins and Helios sit lower on this chart, but so do the G5 and HTC 10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the next compound benchmark, Antutu 6, the roles are oddly reversed. Here the rest of S820 bunch is well ahead of the Xperia, to the tune of 13-15%. The X Performance does leave both the Helio X25 and Kirin 955 behind, by about as much as it trails its S820 rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the graphics department, the Performance's already top-class Adreno 530 GPU gets the additional benefit of the FullHD resolution. We do realize that QHD means 80% more pixels over FullHD, so the trade-off is clear from the get-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the onscreen tests in GFXBench (rendered in the each device's native resolution) the Xperia easily tops the charts. The Xiaomi Mi 5 (which also shies away from QHD resolution) is very close, yet a frame or two behind. In the very demanding 3.1 Manhattan and 3.1 Car scene tests, competing flagships with QHD resolution can only manage about half the frame rate of the Sony (and the Mi5, of course).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Car scene (offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Car scene (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the OpenGL ES 3.1-enabled Basemark ES 3.1, the Xperia X Performance doesn't score particularly high for the chipset. It's a bit odd, given that it topped the GFXBench chart for the same API. The minor positive note here is that the Le Max 2 is still further behind.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the older Basemark X the Xperia is on par with the HTC 10, both towards the back of the S820 pack. It's the Mi 5 and the Le Max 2 that lead the way, with the two different versions of the Galaxy S7 closely behind.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia X Performance's name is very much justified. The mighty Snapdragon 820 chipset with good optimization on Sony's part means heaps of computational power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conservative choice of screen resolution coupled with one of the best GPU's on the market, on the other hand, result in excellent graphics performance too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So after all, the difference in the RAM amount may not be that important or as easy to spot in benchmarking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have a single-SIM Sony Xperia X Performance, but there is a dual-SIM version if you need an extra phone line. Either model has active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log can be filtered by missed, incoming and outgoing calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X's also share a fairly unique feature, a built-in answering machine. It picks up an incoming call, plays your greeting and would later replay your friends' messages. You can set up your greeting and pickup conditions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance has a pair of speakers that can output stereo sound. In terms of loudness, the phone fell in the Below average category on our loudspeaker test, much like the Xperia X, though there were minor differences. Among the top-shelf competitors, the G5 and the P9 are the ones to score noticeably higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the X Performance lacks in punch, though, it makes up for in quality. Even at maximum volume the sound is clean with great definition and no signs of distortion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance has a beautiful Material design messaging app. It feels like the instant messengers you might be used to, including conversations wallpapers and cute stickers you can send.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ours came with panda stickers pre-installed, but you can download more (free and paid sticker packs are available). You can also send your own creations drawn in the Sketch (obviously, this changes the message type to MMS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text entry, Sony picked the SwiftKey keyboard. It became popular for its swipe input, but regular tap-typing with text correction is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is highly customizable - you can change the layout, choose what characters are available (accented characters, emoji), enable a number row, resize the keyboard or even undock it. The Messaging app also handles voice input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lifelog tracks a host of daily activities, including walking, running and sleeping, but also the music you listen and the photos you take or the apps you use. It then presents the info in a split-screen view with a timeline on top and detailed numbers on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is Sony's trusted song recognition software, which has since evolved way past that. It can now show you music charts by country, give you live updates on recent searches across the world, and store your search history as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony's Album is one great gallery app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Album app is among the most comprehensive and feature-rich we've seen, it's fast and easy to use, too! Photos are organized by month, and you can use pinch-zoom to change the size of thumbnails (then they smoothly animate into the grid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very top of the list is a slideshow, showing off your photos, lower down, the first photo of each month is shown at twice the size of other images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can instead browse photos on a map (you can manually add geotag info too) or by folder. This includes network storage so that you can view photos from a DLNA server (your home computer for one). Then there's integration with online albums - Facebook, Picasa, Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image editing is handled by several apps, including Sketch and Sticker maker (so you can create your own custom stickers to send to your friends).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sketch lets you fingerpaint over a photo or a paper-like texture, add text, stickers, photos and so on. If you're talented, you can share your creations on the Sketch mini-social network, and if you're not, you can just browse what others drew.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Movie Creator is similar to the Assistant of Google Photos. It automatically creates short videos from the photos and videos you've shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do it manually too: pick photos and videos, change their order, add color effects and music (you get a small audio collection to start you off, but can use custom files too). Then tap the Share button and send out your animated slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned it in the Display section, but we'll repeat it here. The Sony software uses image enhancements to make even average-looking photos pop. You can choose from Off, X-reality (sharpen and boost contrast) and Super-vivid.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app feels like a part of the same software package as the rest of the custom Sony stuff. The contextual side menu offers much of the same browsing options - by folder, network folder and online services, in this case, Spotify (it's just a link to the Spotify app though). You can share music from the phone to compatible players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button as such is gone, but its functionality is still here in the menu. It can find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music app offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ determines the best audio quality settings depending on the track you're listening to. We liked how it changed the sound and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's DSEE HX, which uses an almost wizardly algorithm , which is supposed to restore or rather extrapolate compressed music files, like MP3s into high-res audio. According to Sony, the result is near Hi-Res Audio Quality. We aren't quite sure about that, but the processing does seem to boost quality quite noticeably. Also, it only works with wired headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the volume differences across tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Movies app is gone, a simpler Video app takes its place. The app is simpler to use - you pick a file from one of the local folders or your home network. You can also use the Search feature to look up videos on YouTube. The app is missing the HTPC-like functionality though, which pulled movie and TV show info automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A chapter view lets you find a specific part of the video, by letting you scrub through a virtual timeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can continue playing in the background (it's an option), but you can't view the video in a small floating window. At least you get full subtitle settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance delivered excellently clean output when used with an active external amplifier, getting top marks across the board. Unfortunately, its output loudness was below average so it?s not all perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Degradation caused by headphones is minimal with a contained hike in stereo crosstalk and a few other minor glitches that are impossible to detect without lab equipment. Volume remained low, but it?s a very good showing nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia X Performance and the Xperia X share the same camera setup - a 23MP Type 1/2.3" Exmor RS sensor, 24mm equivalent lens with f/2.0 aperture. There's no optical image stabilization but Sony's latest Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) tech strives to make videos nice looking and fluid. There is also the added convenience of having a physical camera shutter key, which is a rarity these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big addition in this camera generation is the Predictive Hybrid Autofocus. You can tap on your subject and the camera will track its movement, keeping the focus locked on it. This is great for subjects who would move all around the scene such as a toddler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X Perfromance's camera lets you capture moments in the blink of an eye - from a locked phone, it takes a mere 0.6 seconds to capture the first shot. To use that feature, you need to enable taking a photo when waking the camera with the shutter key in Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature worked as fast as advertised and took the shot before we even got the chance to see the camera viewfinder. Then again, a lot of the photos came out blurry because we were still adjusting the framing of the scene while the phone took the pics. So while image capture is awesomely fast, you still need to adjust your shooting style to make best use of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's latest camera UI is fairly streamlined (as seen in the Z5 series as well). You change modes by swiping up and down (or left and right, if you're holding it in portrait). Superior Auto will probably be the main mode you use, but there's a Manual option too. However, it is quite limited as you can change ISO and white balance, that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera App tab holds some useful features and some features, which are just there for fun. Some of the available modes are Sweep Panorama, Slow-motion video, Face in picture, Sound Photo and a few more. Those are the pre-installed modes, more can be downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie cam has pretty much the same features aside from minor differences (no ISO in manual mode). It even reminds you to look at the camera lens when taking a photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being the same camera as in the Xperia X, the one in the Xperia X Performance unsurprisingly performs identically. In resolved detail its 23MP sensor can easily outdo any competitor, as evidenced by our test charts. And that's while the wide 24-millimeter lens captures more in its frame than any of the competitors. Sharpness is not as high around the corners but that's usually the case with such wide-angle lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos are also contrasty and nicely saturated. Colors are rendered conservatively, which is also good to keep in mind, as the various display enhancements show more punch in the gallery than there actually is in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus speed is an area where the X Performance does an admirable job. It can't compete with the Galaxy S7 and its 12 million phase detection pixels, but it's among the fastest auto focus systems on a cameraphone and it's quite dependable. The predictive autofocus works just advertised too - especially when you have the right scene and subject - say, a toddler or a puppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, while the level of resolved detail is generally very high, you'd best stay away from pixel peeping. The combination of noise and noise reduction leaves a particular grain throughout the frame, which doesn't look good from up close. It's not the good kind of grain that provides a nice natural texture - it looks plain artificial and it takes a toll on areas of uniform textures and vegetation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also struggles with dynamic range and often clips the highlights when faced with difficult high-contrast scenes. It's not so much of a downside, just something to be aware of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between Superior Auto and Manual has shrunk, now that we can select full resolution for Superior Auto (since the Xperia Z5). With all 23 megapixels available, there's really no reason not to use it. It shows you which mode it chooses so it may even be educational to beginner photography enthusiasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In low-light, the 23 megapixel camera quickly loses its resolution advantage over its competitors and the limited dynamic range becomes even more apparent. The level of noise however is quite tolerable so we were happy with the results even when pixel-peeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance's killer feature over the rest of the lineup is the IP68 certification. As luck would have it, we had the phone poolside and curiosity got the better of reason, so we snapped a few underwater shots. All the water made the phone behave rather unpredictably, but resorting to the hardware controls helped a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's HDR implementation is one of the most subtle around. You have two options - let Superior Auto engage it for you when it sees fit, or switch to manual and flip the toggle yourself. Again, the effect is so minor, that Superior Auto seems to be the better option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Sony Xperia X Performance and here's how it fared next to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5. Of course, our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Panorama<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've gotten to a point where we've just given up on hoping for an Xperia that shoots decent panoramas. It starts with the interface that forces you to select which way you intend to swipe, instead of recognizing it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panoramas are mere 1080 pixels tall, regardless of whether you're shooting in landscape or portrait. Little resolved detail, stitching issues - there's not much to like about them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Selfie camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front camera is equally impressive. It has a 1/3" Exmor RS sensor with 13MP resolution and f/2.0 G Lens. It's the kind of setup some lower-end phones would use for their main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony tech promises good performance in low light and smartly adjust the shutter speed based on movement in the scene - a static scene gets a long exposure time to reduce noise, a dynamic scene a short one to reduce motion blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera of the Xperia X Performance is capable of some great high-res selfies. To get the most detail out of it, make sure you turn off the Soft Skin effect from settings (a separate toggle for Superior Auto and Manual, mind you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The improved low-light capabilities of the front facing camera meant we got nicely exposed photos even in the dark. Unfortunately, the front camera?s autofocus is a hit-and-miss in the dark. Once light levels drop, the images turn inexplicably soft so much so that it's as if the auto focus system stops working.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The source of perhaps the greatest disappoint about the Xperia X Performance - it can't shoot 4K videos. Or rather it can (the hardware certainly supports it), but Sony didn't choose to enable it. Video recording tops out at 1080p/60fps, and you have the regular 30fps speed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 1080p/30fps mode is encoded at about 17.5Mbps, on par with the competitors. The smoother 1080p/60fps gets a 30Mbps bit rate. Audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps, regardless of the video setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We might have been inclined to go easier on the X Performance if its 1080p videos were really great. The thing is they aren't quite up there with the best on the market. There's the compression-induced oscillation we witnessed on the Xperia X in action-heavy scenes. The resolved detail is about average, and not at the level of the G5's and Galaxy S7's of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video samples: 1080p at 30fps (11s, 23.9MB), 1080p at 60fps (11s, 40.6MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also compare the Xperia X Performance to any of the numerous phones and tablets we've tested, but we've pre-selected the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia X Performance key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High-quality build, brushed metal back shouts "premium" while the polycarbonate frame sits unobtrusively in the corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent display with high contrast and maximum brightness, and good in bright daylight. Fairly accurate color reproduction is marred by bluish whites, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Average battery life - 61h endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vanilla Android experience, Sony's changes are subtle and welcome. Small apps are gone along with the screen recording feature and may be missed by some, but there's screen pinning now (Toddler mode) and Sony's trademark Stamina mode is back after being absent for a while from Sony's Android Marshmallow builds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Top-tier benchmark performance, the Snapdragon 820 proves itself once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich multimedia app package courtesy of Sony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below average loudspeaker loudness, very clean output though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Same for audio quality - excellent marks for clarity, below average in the loudness department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>23MP camera captures a lot of detail and has one of the fastest autofocus and startup times, but images also come with plenty of noise and certain softness around the corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>13MP selfies come out quite detailed in bright daylight, but focusing is badly impaired in low light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We started with a question and we're still struggling for an answer. The Xperia X Performance could've been better - or cheaper - or could've come sooner. Now, there's little anyone can do about any of those... But we'd be darned if there isn't an Xperia X Premium or Pro, or Plus, or whatever, in the works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How so? Well, there's just too many areas, where Sony held back, as if deliberately leaving some headroom for the lineup to grow up in display size and resolution, or in video recording and battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few inevitable comparisons within the Sony lineup are due. For one, the plain Xperia X is less expensive (not that it's anything close to affordable) and yet it's basically the same phone, save for the weaker chipset and lack of water-proofing. Except that it has better battery life, and that midrange chipset pulls off quite a good showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Xperia Z5, the last flagship from the pre-X era. Its chipset may be last-year's issue, but it's flagship-grade, and it's at least put to good use crunching 4K videos, something the Xperia X Performance doesn't get to do. With few (if any) meaningful differences between the two, the Z5 is a steal at ?250/$250 cheaper than the X Performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the flagship to beat this season, and the Xperia will have a tough time against it. The IP rating can't settle it here, the Xperia X Performance has a higher-res camera - close to twice the MP count actually... and that's about it. The S7 has a higher battery capacity (and longer battery life), wireless charging, 4K recording, OIS, Samsung Pay in an increasing number of markets, higher-res AMOLED display - there's probably more. Did we mention the Galaxy S7 is ?100/$100 cheaper? In fact, for the X Performance's money, you can get an S7 edge with perhaps some change to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is priced in the X Performance's ballpark, so this should be a fight on the merits. The HTC 10 is arguably the looker of the two, but with its IP53 rating where immersion is out of the question it pales in comparison to the Xperia's IP68 spec. The 10's got a higher-res display, more RAM, and 4K video recording, but stills are 12MP only vs the Xperia's 23MP. The Type-C connector on the HTC flagship will have you nicely future-proofed though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is the only current flagship with a removable battery, and it's also big on modularity. You can install an additional audio amp or add a camera grip with some more battery inside - handy, as the G5 is the only direct competitor that the Xperia X Performance can actually outperform battery-life-wise. The G5 has 2 cameras on its back, which can both record 4K video - that's two more than the Xperia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another similarly equipped competitor, the Xiaomi Mi 5 squeezes out substantially longer endurance from its slightly higher-capacity battery, and it weighs 36g less than the Xperia. 4K video, OIS, USC Type-C, Quick Charge 3.0 - the Mi 5 has them all, the X Performance has none. What it does offer on top of the Mi 5 is a microSD slot. However, in regions where you can get a Mi 5 to begin with, its price starts at a third of the X Performance's. Sure, we know, Xiaomi is no Sony, but smartphones have already turned into a commodity and as such, they compete based on price and features and in some departments, it's almost like Sony's bringing a knife to a gun fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia X Performance is certainly the best smartphone the company's lineup has to offer. Which, as it stands, is not really enough to make it a meaningful competitor against Sony's own from last year, let alone reigning heavyweights from other major brands. That is, if you're price-conscious enough to make your buying decisions based on price/feature ratio. Sony's brand has always transcended mere feature count so we're about to see whether their product strategy will turn out a success.</paragraph>
