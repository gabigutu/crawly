			<paragraph>When talking about good design it's usually all about placing the right elements in the right places. And in the rare cases when an R&amp;D team actually comes up with something innovative, they usually reserve it for a 2000 buck handset like the Motorola Aura. The LG GD900 Crystal and its see-through keypad, however, prefers walking among the mortals to sitting on mount Olympus and drinking ambrosia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And luckily the sleek handset is much more than a pretty face. The rich feature set of the GD900 Crystal places it only a short step away from LG's multimedia flagships. However the lack of GPS is easily made up for with cool features like gesture shortcuts and multi-touch input. Sure, these may seem like fancy additions rather than key features, but sometimes it's all about winning the hearts of the users rather than their minds. And the Crystal seems pretty well designed to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what we have on our hands here is a handset that's dressed to impress and with a mind bright enough to keep your attention. We really like it when there's something new thrown at us and a see-through touch-sensitive keypad is certainly a first in the mobile world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The novelty factor is certainly there, we only need t to check if the delicate LG Crystal will pass our tests with flying colors. The ergonomics inspection is due right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD900 Crystal 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG GD900 Crystal isn't the most compact of sliders we have seen but at 105 x 52.5 x 13.5 mm,it can still slip effortlessly in your pocket. The weight of 127 g might be a bit hard for some to swallow but it actually makes for a nice solid feel in your hand - a nice contrast with the plastic body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly the see-through keypad is what gives the LG GD900 Crystal its main appeal. Unique and different enough to put the device in a class of its own, its white glow looks really fascinating, especially in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, almost the entire LG GD900 body is covered with a thin layer of transparent plastic, which we aren't really great fans of. Now don't get us wrong - the handset still looks pretty cool overall, it's just that it would have been even better with some metal accents here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel the GD900 Crystal is mostly about the 3" 16M color touchscreen display of WVGA (480 x 800 pixels) resolution. Even if colorwise it may be a notch below the stunning AMOLED screen of the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH, the LG Crystal display still delivers decent image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Crystal touchscreen uses the capacitive technology, which requires only a touch rather than a push to register a click. Even the lightest of touches does the trick which is probably a large part of the reason why people buy touchscreen phones in the first place. One downside of capacitive touchscreens though is that they can't be used with either stylus or gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In common with the LG Arena, the LG Crystal has multi-touch support, which means you can use the two-finger pinch-to-zoom gesture made popular by the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the LG GD900 Crystal display performs quite poor when exposed to direct sunlight. It's almost impossible to find a decent angle to operate the phone comfortably in such conditions, which does detract from the overall user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a gray frame around the display of the LG GD900 Crystal with the loudspeaker grill, the video-call camera and the proximity sensor piercing its top end. There is also a proximity sensor that makes sure the display is automatically locked when you place it next to your ear during a conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite end there are three touch-sensitive buttons below the display that are covered by a thick transparent plastic. Those keys include a shortcut to the cube interface and the two standard call handling keys - Call and End.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the Crystal's most extraordinary feature: the see-through keypad is actually a simple touchscreen with letters etched on its surface and a metallic frame. The cool illuminations actually come from the side, somewhere from within the main body of the handset. That said, we admit we're oversimplifying things in our description to make the concept easier to grasp. In fact we're quite impressed by the clever implementation and the LG R&amp;D team certainly deserves quite a few pats on the back for coming up with the LG Crystal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-sensitive keypad is smooth and really responsive but we doubt that its input capabilities are a match for a regular tactile-feedback one. It is certainly cool looking and unique, but feature-wise it does nothing but double the touchscreen as an input option. Still, even if it serves almost no practical purpose, it remains one of the best reasons for getting the Crystal, so we shouldn't judge it too hard we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus it offers multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom and gesture shortcuts. The latter is certainly one of our favorite features, allowing instant access to your favorite applications. We'll take a closer look at them later in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only element on the left side of LG GD900 is the microUSB port, covered by a small plastic lid to prevent it from getting all dusty. The LG Crystal was the first LG phone to come with a such a universal connectivity port and more will surely follow. It will certainly make consolidating your family cellphone accessories a realistic task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Crystal hosts the camera key and the volume rocker. Those are average in size but we are not particularly happy with the feedback they provide. We are not saying that they are hard to use, but we have certainly seen better. Strangely enough those were working fine on our pre-release Crystal that we previewed a while ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG Crystal features the On/Off button which, much like on the LG Arena, is used to lock the device display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the GD900 hosts the 8 megapixel camera and its companions - the self-portrait mirror and the LED flash. Those are of course only visible when the slider is open, giving them plenty of protection from scratches. Right next to them is the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were able to confirm that the Crystal can handle a 16GB microSD card, which is the largest currently available on the market. It also has an acceptable initializing time with that kind of card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is as interesting as the see-through keypad. At first you might be wondering how to get to the battery but then you'll notice the small shiny latch at the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem with the battery cover is that it seems too prone to scratches. The transparent plastic is soft and it only took us a short time to get a couple of them and we are pretty careful when handling our phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the semitransparent battery cover is the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery as well as the SIM card slot. The battery is quoted at 300 hours of standby and up to 6 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality the handset can make it through a day and a half of some intensive usage (twenty minutes of telephony, half an hour of browsing, about thirty photos and a couple of hours of exploring the rest of the features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of LG GD900 Crystal is good, and there are only a few slight creaks on the back. The slider is also nicely done - as is usual for LG, it's smooth and stable. The only real negative is the battery cover's aforementioned ability to attract scratches.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Class goes on the glass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class UI has already taken a prominent place among full touch phone interfaces. LG seem to have struck gold with it and the new fancy 3D UI will thrive across touchscreen feature phones and Windows Mobile handsets alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Class builds heavily upon previous UI solutions in the LG range and thus still feels familiar enough even with the number of innovations introduced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive touchscreen is quite responsive and haptic feedback has always been on the LG feature list. Hardware graphic acceleration is essential: everything from homescreen to dropdown menus roll, sweep in, unfold and rotate extra smoothly. The LG Arena gave us a good glimpse of all that, the Viewty Smart continued the trend, here we are with the Crystal and waiting to see the upgraded S-Class in the still unannounced BL40 Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some may bemoan the lack of any distinction between the LG Arena and the Viewty Smart in terms of interface - same icons, same menus, etc. However, the LG Crystal does offer for the first time the S-Class White theme, along with the standard one. This enables the device to really stand on its own and prevents any confusion with the other LG handsets using the same UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's proceed with the rundown of the S-Class UI: it is still novel enough to warrant a closer look, but there is very little increase in functionality unless the white theme is groundbreaking for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to note is the four homescreens, which break down the interface into four easily manageable chunks: widgets, contacts, shortcuts and multimedia. You can easily see their new clothes from the screenshots below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eye catching 3D Cube is the core of the interface - the four homescreens are placed on the sides of a cube that you roll by finger sweeps. You can zoom out by pressing the dedicated center key and roll the cube to select a homescreen. The 3D Cube interface is nothing unique: it dates back to the HTC Cube launcher and gets various interpretations like in the Samsung Jet we recently reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Shortcut homescreen is well known since the LG Cookie and LG Prada2. The empty space can be populated with various shortcuts for different apps. But given the wonderful main menu, we are not sure this screen is all that necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Widget homescreen offers a bunch of widgets we've seen before in previous LG or Samsung handsets - there's the analog clock, calendar, world time, WeatherBug, games, FM radio, memo, and a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging widget you see on the top of the widget screen is a new addition. It gives you quick access to the voice, text or email features, as well as a log of new events in any of the above categories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third Cube wall contains the Contact homescreen, where you can assign photos to various contacts for quick access to their numbers and SMS/call options. They are displayed on a rotating reel, similar to how the fourth multimedia homescreen is filled with pictures and songs. All the reels are touch-optimized and on some occasions are very quick and efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of all though, these 3D simulations throughout the interface are just there for the sake of good looks rather than any practical purpose. We find the Contact homescreen the most appropriate for a homescreen and in fact many users prefer it, while the Multimedia and Shortcuts seem to be there just for the sake of completing the four walls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, no matter which homescreen you choose, the UI never skimps on eye candy - smooth animations, reflections, 3D spatial effects, motion blurring - it's all there for your viewing pleasure. And better still - the 3" WVGA screen makes sure the image quality is exceptional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Snow-white main menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. LG have opted for a layout of four rows of menu items that are scrollable horizontally. In this way almost all menu items are accessible simultaneously without switching tabs, as it used to be on previous LG touch handsets. Turning the phone sideways, the auto-rotate kicks in listing all menu items with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either). This time the menu theme is white by default, with circular thumbnails reminiscent of bubbles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal has the basic task manager that is launched upon a press-and-hold of the Cube key on the handset's left side. This is another way to access the most common features, not just switch between the active ones. The active apps are signified by the respective icon bouncing up and down in a nice animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG decided to extend the basic functionality of the task manager with the "Gesture shortcuts". When you choose this option you'll have nearly 20 predefined shortcut-moves you can assign to different applications in the multitasking menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having touch gestures is a very useful option for starting the applications you use the most, not to mention it looks extra cool (in a geeky way) to start applications with gestures instead of just pressing an icon. Bear in mind that the gestures are recognized only when they are made on the glass keyboard. On the screen they will not work, but that's understandable because every move on the homescreen will be recognized as a swipe and will automatically scroll to the next one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to see how gesture control works, check out our hands-on video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking is limited - only two applications can run at a time and Java apps interfere with other apps. For example, with a Java app running in the background you won't be able to turn the Radio on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Status bar at the top of the screen launches a semitransparent menu that can be used to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, change profiles and view recent events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this connection manager menu is available only on the homescreen. It would have been handier if it was usable throughout the interface - the way it is in the Android OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook with no changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Crystal, just like the LG Arena and the Viewty Smart sports one of the most attractive and best touch-optimized phonebooks we've seen so far on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Contact list has tiny separators with the corresponding alphabetical letter. If not expanded, every field has a picture icon, a name and a green call button for quick dial. To display the full contact details you simply tap on it and its contents expand in a dropdown right between the neighboring phonebook names. There you can also find the different buttons for calls, messages and editing organized in a scrollable row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of the interface on the GD900 Crystal, the phonebook is highly touch-optimized too. Scrolling is as smooth as possible with no lags and this is the only UI currently on the market to match the fluid response of the iPhone. There is a scroll bar on the right side to allow movement through the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there is a search option and it's available at the top of your contact list. The other way to access it is by the dedicated options button in the upper left corner. In the same two locations you'll also find the "New contact" buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available contact fields are pretty standard and offer whatever you can think up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can put a shortcut on the photo contact homescreen by selecting the small star button next to a contact. This contact then automatically appears in the appropriate place and you can reorder via tap-and-hold on the contact homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll hear us compare (and quite favorably too) the S-Class UI with the iPhone but the Crystal (and all the current S-Class devices for that matter) lacks kinetic scrolling, which would've made the great phonebook just perfect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal handles phone calls flawlessly, as you have every right to expect. The phone dialer works with an on-screen numeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any LG handset - the green receiver key takes you to the list of all calls. You can access them from the main menu too, but unlike the previous LG handsets, you won't find call time counters and the web data counter here. Instead, those are moved to the Call settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dial is also onboard. As usual, you can type any numbers and you'll receive suggestions immediately. They'll be organized in a dropdown window, same as a contact's details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call history is accessed by the green hardware button below the screen and it also follows the phonebook with its dropdown layout. The readings you get there are the usual call duration, time and type of call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal scored just good in our loudspeaker performance test. Here is how it stacks up against some of the other handsets we've put through it. More info on our test is available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging as it should be<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only two major sections in the main menu - Messaging and Email. The LG Crystal supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. Much like the Arena, Renoir and Viewty2, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages are neatly organized in a standard list view and sorted by date. You can choose a filter - SMS, MMS or notifications. Naturally, the Inbox is the default location when you enter the Messaging menu, but you can change it to Outbox, Sent, Drafts or My Folders. There is also an option for a threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the number pad, or you can flip the Crystal on its side and go for the landscape QWERTY keyboard. There is touch feedback either way, and typing is very accurate even if the QWERTY keyboard buttons are a bit small. Either way, thanks to the capacitive screen both produce no lag and are as responsive as the iPhone's virtual QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving your cursor through the text is also a breeze. You can either tap the place on the screen where you want your cursor or, if you need more precision, a longer press over the cursor activates a virtual loupe that allows you to move it around more accurately character by character (think iPhone style). Copying and pasting is always available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But hey, don't forget the nicely illuminated see-through keypad. When you slide it while typing, the onscreen keyboard disappears and you're free to use the hardware one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time is quite unusual because it's like typing with the virtual numeric keypad, but it's not virtual at all. And of course, the blue lights surrounding the whole thing are a feast both for your eyes and those around you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also handwriting recognition which is very capable, but really too slow for effective text input. It works fine on both screen and keyboard and is definitely a new thing among phones with capacitive screens. However, It's unlikely to be the first choice of a messaging addict.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, set up on the LG Crystal is hassle-free. Adding an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup scheme. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 1MB, as it was on the LG Arena. This is not enough for a 8 megapixel photo, which is a shame really given the camera the device has. A 3.2 MP snap or a small video should be no problem, while attachments such as documents or presentations will easily fall under that limitation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir for example had a 2MB limit, which is still restricting but a bit more respectable. If you decide to attach a picture in the Crystal's email client it won't even resize automatically. The only way for the phone to do it for you is choosing the "Attach - Take a picture" button in the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an image editor, which can also do the job of resizing a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but you can still save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and viewed directly inside the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for setting multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>File management is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal comes with 1.5GB of onboard storage and of course it's expandable via the microSD memory card slot. Hot-swapping a memory card is easy, especially given that this time the slot is not under the battery cover. We can also confirm that 8GB and 16GB microSD cards worked fine on our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal file manager appears as the My Stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders, but you may put various content in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast, even when your memory card has loads of images on (800+ in our case). Fortunately, the files on the phone memory and the card don't get listed together as it was on some previous LG handsets. That eliminates the problem of always seeing the files from the microSD first on the list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery still pleases us all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Crystal offers two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation, the same as in the Arena and Viewty Smart. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid sorted by date, type or name, while in landscape mode one image is displayed in the center with two more on its sides in a nice 3D spatial view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Did anybody say Cover Flow? Yes, the layout is quite similar to the Apple iPhone Cover Flow album art browsing, but let us remind you that the iPhone only offers that view mode in its iPod app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the LG GD900 Crystal supports multi-touch you can zoom in on images with the pinching gesture familiar from the iPhone. Bear in mind that quite naturally the 8 megapixel photos zoom slower than 2 or 3 megapixel snaps taken with an iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the standard options such as rename, delete, print, send and info, there is also a slideshow mode. You can choose the time interval and the display order (shuffle or not). The nice transition effects are random, we couldn't find a dedicated option for choosing a specific one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the "star" button is also here for creating picture shortcuts on the multimedia homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the hardware keypad is as easy as using the screen and the advantage here is that your fingers don't get in your way while scrolling/zooming. Multi-touch is also available and frankly we very much liked the whole idea of using an external sensor glass for exploring the gallery. You get the full touch experience, but you don't obstruct the view with your finger. When you add the transparent factor, the whole thing is so wonderfully sci-fi (geeks silently rejoice).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dolby Mobile as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal music player is accessible both from the Cube interface and the main menu. The Cube-accessed music player is rather basic but it does offer a quick route to your tunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The individual music tracks are displayed on a rotating reel and come with their album art "printed" on virtual vinyl records. You can scroll with your finger through them to change tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full-featured music player sits in the main menu. You can sort tracks by artist, album, genre and rating. The current track's artwork, name, album and artist are displayed in the screen's center while the next and previous tracks are visible at the top and bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new addition here is the huge Shuffle button on the top of the playlist, which is quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the music player automatically switches its orientation from/to landscape mode when you rotate the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very useful feature is the Search option. However, if you have applied some kind of sorting such as Album view, for instance, you can only search the album names and not the actual tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of equalizer presets (all non-customizable, though) and among them two managed to impress us. The first is the highly promoted Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Dolby Mobile the sound is richer and more spacious. Bobcat Mobile was also a really nice preset which is best suited for techno tracks. With all the presets available we're sure you'll find the one to suit your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Crystal comes with an FM radio that you can listen to both via the headphones and the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the headphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS. Scrolling stations is very easy and intuitive - you have quick access via the two rows of buttons below the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, when the FM radio is running in the background you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally A2DP is also supported, allowing you to listen to music via stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal comes with a high-res WVGA and relatively large 3-inch touch screen. That, along with the DivX/XviD support turns it into a potentially excellent portable video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the only DivX videos we managed to play on the Crystal were those processed by the DivX converter on the supplied CD. But that's no surprise since we had exactly the same issues with the Arena and the Viewty Smart. The LG Renoir for example managed to play every desktop XViD/DivX video we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch the video player to full screen mode you only need to rotate the phone to landscape position. A tap on the touch screen reveals the onscreen overlay controls. Alongside the standard controls (such as play/pause, volume, etc.) you can also change playing speed to 2x or 4x and to zoom in or out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement can also be applied during video playback on the LG Crystal. Of course, that enhancement is put to best use with headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Guess what - no Wi-Fi video streaming again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Crystal comes with YouTube integration and you can upload videos to YouTube directly from the handset. Bear in mind that the option is available only in the video player and not in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Crystal web browser, as with every other LG phone, doesn't have Flash support, so watching YouTube videos in the web browser straight from the desktop version of the web site is a no-go. The only way to watch your favorite videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately and typically, the LG Crystal allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over the EDGE or UMTS connection, so in essence you cannot stream mobile YouTube videos over Wi-Fi. A real bummer, we know. The same strange issue plagues the Arena, the Prada 2 and the Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since a lot of users don't seem aware of this fact, here's a tip - to watch any streaming video (such as YouTube) you first need to set up the dedicated streaming settings of the phone to use the same internet profile as your mobile web browser. The place you do that is on Settings row&gt;Connectivity&gt; Streaming settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>One of the worst 8 megapixel cameras around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal sports an 8 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. It boasts fancy Schneider-Kreuznach optics and a LED flash which, as you might have guessed, doesn't do much good. It might only make a difference in extremely dark conditions at the closest of ranges but don't expect anything beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface of the GD900 Crystal is identical to the one on the GC900 Viewty Smart. Access to all the camera settings is via the left taskbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for flash, focus mode (auto/macro) and exposure plus an advanced settings key. This left toolbar auto hides when not used and you need to tap on the screen to bring it back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the screen is another bar with a virtual shutter key, that also slides up and down to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside are the exit and gallery buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This taskbar is fixed and actually not part of the viewfinder - that's the way to get around the difference between the wide aspect ratio of the screen and the standard 4:3 image sensor. If you don't like that, you can opt for the full screen view where a part of the image does get cropped but you see the center bit in more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual Settings menu is a clever rotating dial with the available options for each setting displayed as a list. We have to admit that it is somewhat slow to navigate and find the right option but it is certainly very nice looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal sports a ton of extra camera features with geotagging, face recognition and smile shot being some of the most notable. You also get image stabilization and viewfinder grid to help you better frame your photos. The LG GD900 also supports up to ISO 1600 but unless you like looking at 8 megapixels of noise blobs, we would suggest you stay as far away from it as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the LG GD900 Crystal was somewhat of a disappointment. It might do the job if you aren't too fussy but any comparison to other 8 megapixel handsets on the market is to the phone's detriment. In fact the camera quality is absolutely identical to the LG Viewty Smart, and we thought that was pretty uninspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have to say anything positive about the image quality it'd be that the colors are pretty decent and so is contrast in the photos. The amount of resolved detail is also good but the noise levels can basically ruin the whole deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal, along with the Viewty2, is by far the noisiest 8 megapixel camera we have seen so far and the difference is easily visible even at the lowest ISO settings. This is probably another handset to confirm the "more MP equals more noise" mantra. While we'd still pick it over most 5 MP shooters, the Crystal won't be our weapon of choice in the 8 MP game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that both Crystal and Viewty Smart use same 8 megapixel camera sensors with identical image processing algorithms, which as you see are not quite up to the job. We wonder why LG didn't put some extra work to fix the image quality on both devices, but let's hope changes can be made with future firmware updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG GD900 Crystal. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal is capable of capturing video of up to D1 (720x480) resolution at 30 fps. The video recording quality, unlike that of the still camera, is pretty good. The level of detail could have been a touch better, but the colors are lively with an extra notch of saturation added by the camera. The noise isn't at all that much of an issue here. Yep - exactly the same as the LG Viewty Smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Crystal, just like the Arena and Viewty2, uses the outdated low-bitrate 3GP video format, which we didn't really like. We would much rather see more handsets like the LG Renoir, which uses the AVI file format with DivX encoding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slow-motion QVGA clips shot at 120 fps are also an option on the LG Crystal and the device, much like the LG Secret and Arena, takes the extra step of adding Fast videos. This is the time-lapse video capture seen in some dedicated digicams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the right subjects those shooting modes can be quite fun. Unfortunately, the output videos are still limited to QVGA resolution. The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH for example already shoots fast motion videos at VGA resolution of enviable quality. And as far as we know, those videos don't require more processing power than the device already has so why not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash can be turned on to act as a video light. Quite naturally, you can also record sound with videos, except in the fast/slow-mo modes of course. As we already pointed out, the dedicated video recording microphone is on the back of the phone. Videos are encoded in MP4 but are saved in 3GP format.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wireless connectivity is complete on the LG Crystal. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is on board and so is the HSDPA 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports the two local connectivity standards - Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Bluetooth version is 2.1 with A2DP support for stereo streaming while the Wi-Fi antenna works with 802.11 b/g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi options have a simple interface - you choose the desired network, type the pass key and voila. Of course there are plenty of advanced options available for the geeks out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last and most important thing is that every installed Java application which requires internet access prompts you to choose between UMTS and Wi-Fi, which is a great option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary universal connectivity port is used to connect the charger or a USB cable. Speaking of USB, Mass storage mode is also supported so you can use the phone as portable memory storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An optional TV-out cable can also be plugged into the connectivity port as the Crystal supports the feature. PAL and NTSC are supported, so it should work on most TV sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to LG Arena, the Crystal's internal memory gets listed as a second removable drive along with the memory card contents. We were also impressed that the Crystal can even receive calls in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A welcome decision by LG is to change their standard proprietary cable to a microUSB one. For people with more than one phone it may turn one of the most important changes, easing the work with cables, chargers and headsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing PIM details is done through the LG PC Suite that comes on the bundled CD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The browser lacks Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser is identical to the LG Arena's. Unfortunately, scrolling and panning is not really that fluid. Thanks to the multi-touch implementation, the Crystal delivers where other browsers fail - the legendary 'pinch' zoom of the iPhone (well, the Hero and Pre are to offer that as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loading speeds are not enviable either. Over Wi-Fi, the LG Crystal browser takes twice the time to fully load a page than the iPhone's and you can't really pan around while the page is still loading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-touch zooming has been tweaked since the latest LG Prada phone, but not at all since the LG Arena. There still is a slight lag, though nothing major. It's not as fluid as the iPhone but still does an ok job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls don't auto-hide and the only option to make them disappear is to turn on the full screen view from the browser menu or rotate the phone to landscape. There the accelerometer comes into play and does its job pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful feature is that you can have two pages open at the same time in tabs and switch back and forth between them. Saving pages for offline viewing is another thing that you'll probably use quite often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handy browser skill is searching web pages for specific words - the first match gets highlighted and the total number of matches is displayed with up and down buttons to scroll through them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A visual enhancement of the plain browsing history list is the option to view snapshots of the pages you've visited. You can flick between the pages and tap to open the one you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor keyboard really makes a difference in the web browser department. Besides zooming, you can also use it as a trackpad. Sweeping a finger across it moves the mouse on the screen. This eliminates the continuous tapping on some hyperlink or a button until the browser understands that you want to select it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. But, as we already pointed out in the video section of this review, you can go for the mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com once you tweak your streaming settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried the Opera Mini browser and it worked just fine. It's very fast loading pages, zooming or scrolling them, and there is also a nice integrated RSS reader. Especially the version without the Java aid controls and it worked just fine. There is no multi-touch in this one, but if you want speed, then Opera Mini is the way to go for now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer does a nice job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keeping a schedule is an important part of the LG Crystal and it has several applications to help you. The nice Organizer combines a calendar with monthly and weekly views and a task list. Event alarms can be set to go off up to a week earlier to give you enough time to prepare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to choose whether the week starts Monday or Sunday is also included. There's even an option to mark some days as holidays and set the Alarm not to ring on those days. 'Holidays' are not repeated annually so it's more useful to mark your vacation rather than national holidays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A To-Do application lets you keep a list of tasks sorted by their importance. If those reminders aren't enough you can always jot down a Memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal can store up to 500 calendar events, 500 To-Do notes and 100 memos and making a back up to external memory is just a few clicks away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the S-class interface the alarm functions have been completely revised for the better. Forget the ugly old settings used on the previous LG flagship phones. Apart from the default widget alarm you can create as many alarms as you want. This gives you access to another eye-catching interface - an analog clock where you set the hand at the desired time. Of course there is a digital one for those who'd rather. The other available settings are alarm tone, vibration type and availability, while the snooze option makes sure you are not late for work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you also get a Calculator with the new touch-optimized interface and a wide array of functions (basic and advanced mathematical functions), a Unit Converter, a World Clock and a Voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder does not have a limit on the maximum length of a voice note and once you are done recording you can send it via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games &amp; Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Picsel viewer handles Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Zooming in and out is done by - you guessed it - pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a useful option to fit the contents in a single column but it only seems to work for doc files. The viewer makes full use of the accelerometer and auto rotates to take advantage of the wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps also comes preinstalled on the LG Crystal but the lack of a GPS receiver limits the use of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled games on the LG Crystal are all motion-based - Flying Dice, Wheel Mania, Tepong, Dart and Golf Slope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flying dice lets you pick a board and play against another player. You take turns to roll two dice (by shaking the phone of course) and then release them on the table. You move round the board and can either land on a good or a bad square. Landing on a bad square can actually mean whatever you and your gaming partner agree on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wheel Mania also lets you choose a template - cards, foods, drinks, activities, cars and more. Then you spin the wheel and wait to see your fortune.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third game is ping-pong and we spent most of the time on it. It's simple enough - you must hit a ping-pong ball with increasing power and score more and more? until you hit an airplane (no kidding).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Golf Slope is a useful app for those of you who play real golf. It uses the accelerometer and three saved positions to create a virtual layout of the terrain. We can only assume this is supposed to help you in your golf game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If those aren't enough (and they really aren't if you are into mobile gaming), you can install Java MIDP 2.0 games and applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal is the first device that feels like it's from the future. At heart it is the same as the LG Arena and Viewty Smart, but sliding it up reveals something far more impressive. The transparent glass sensor keyboard is something genuinely new and innovative. Typing, browsing or viewing photos is a complete different experience and make you feel like you are in a sci-fi movie. Currently there are almost no competitors with this particular form factor, so let's at least look at those in the same ballpark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Arena is the first released S-Class handset and apart from some GPS limitations we could find little to fault it. In terms of features the two devices are essentially the same, except for the reduced megapixel count on the Arena's camera and the lack of a glass keyboard. It's currently priced at 300 euro, which is quite tempting for customers seeking the standard S-Class experience and who have no need of the fancy glass thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KM900 Arena</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8000 Jet has just hit the shelves but is already winning many customers. The new 3D TouchWiz interface may well be a match for the S-Class, especially given the powerful hardware on the Jet. The compact design and equally matched feature set (including full DivX/XviD support, full Flash support, Smart Unlock, excellent 5MP camera) make the Jet quite a threat, regardless of the lack of a transparent glass keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8000 Jet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Competition-wise, if it's a point &amp; shoot camera with telephony you're after, you should have a look at our 8 megapixel shootout. The contenders there are all aging gracefully and their prices are falling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson C905 ? Samsung i8510 INNOV8 ? Samsung M8800 Pixon ? LG KC910 Renoir</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH is probably the best among the new crop of slim 8 megapixel cameraphones and if imaging capabilities are a priority, you should definitely check it out. Its touch interface may be slower, but it's got the same form factor and its camera is little short of perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day the LG Crystal left a really positive impression on us. It certainly has a wow-factor to it with its unique look, style and transparent glass keypad, and is well-equipped comes with the most common features such as 3G, Wi-Fi, a fancy UI and 8 megapixel camera. Yes, the snapper may be a bit of a disappointment, but the rest is a wonderful and unusual experience. If the price seems reasonable for what you'll get, then we recommend that you go for it.</paragraph>
