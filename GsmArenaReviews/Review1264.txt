			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson can sit back and call it a job done. The last of the new Xperias is on the shelves and the impressive lineup gives them plenty of reasons to look forward to the holiday season.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a squad they have put together. The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro had to wait long months to finally get some game time. Announced way back in February, the Xperia messenger watched from the sidelines as others went ahead of it. It was a long line too, with two Arcs, two Neos, two minis, the PLAY, the Active and the Ray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It must've been a long wait for users too, judging by your comments on this website. There has been nothing official in the way of an explanation about the delayed launch. Maybe that's the way Sony Ericsson had planned it from the beginning. Perhaps they thought business users, who are a potential target, were least likely to lose their patience. Maybe they didn't want two very similar phones stepping on each other's toes - trying to get the best mileage out of the Neo before the Pro hit the shelves. Or maybe, they just wanted to finish with a bang.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the best Sony Ericsson have to offer today. That includes a LED-backlit Reality display with Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine, an 8 megapixel ExmorR camera sensor, 720p video with continuous autofocus, and the latest Android 2.3.4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone can't be blamed for falling short of the mark. And we don't mean that it gets away with the lack of some premium features just because it was announced early this year. The way we see it, a multiple core processor is something for flagships to worry about. You can hold it against the Xperia Arc S. By the same token, a cameraphone like the Xperia Neo isn't quite up to scratch without the 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro for its part is a smart messenger that might appeal to both business customers and young social users. That's right, these are two completely different targets but it's just the way of a market steadily moving towards smartphones and all-inclusive user experience. Anyway, the point is enough people may actually find the Xperia pro relevant to what they need even without multiple-core processing or FullHD video. One thing we're sure they don't need is a huge gadget in their pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson took their time with the Pro but it seems the competition hasn't been too keen on messengers either. There hasn't been anything major since the HTC Desire Z and the Milestone 2, at least not in Europe. The closest thing is another Sony Ericsson phone: the Xperia mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the mini messenger but Sony Ericsson obviously think it's time for the real deal. We're about to start our traditional hardware checkup and we're looking forward to a comfortable ride. The bigger screen and keyboard should make enough of a difference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xperia pro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro's retail box brings no surprises - a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for charging and computer connections) and an in-ear headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are a couple of user guides and an 8GB microSD card in the box. The only thing missing is an HDMI cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia pro 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Ericsson Xperia pro weighs in at 142 grams and stretches to 120 x 57 x 13.5 mm. That's nearly the same size as the Xperia neo, which is quite an achievement, considering they squeezed in a QWERTY keyboard without increasing the thickness. It's a reasonably compact messenger with good handling, and it looks even slimmer because of the inward rear curve.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of Sony Ericsson Xperia pro mixes Xperia neo and Xperia arc. Looked from the front, the Neo and the Pro are almost impossible to tell apart. The back has a similar inward curve as the two Xperia Arcs, slightly less prominent perhaps as the Pro is obviously not as tall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it's a familiar look and the styling lacks any kind of ornaments. We like the strip of silver that frames the phone's body asymmetrically - thin on the sides, wider at the top and bottom. Our review unit is the red flavor. It wouldn't have been our first choice but it has a serious advantage over the black unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro finish is heavy on gloss and gets covered in grease in no time. The smudges are quite hard to clean too but, luckily, not as visible on the red and probably silver version. For the black one though there is no hope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the phone?s front is taken by the 3.7" 16M-color LCD screen with a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The Xperia pro uses the same Reality display as the Xperia arc, neo, ray and arc S, enhanced with the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine. The high-quality LED-backlit LCD has pleasing colors and commendable sunlight legibility. The questionable feature is viewing angles: whn you look at the display at an angle, contrast is quickly lost and the colors get washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Reality display is no match for the Samsung?s SuperAMOLED, it?s on the better side of LCDs and we've repeatedly praised the recent Sony Ericsson smartphones for the notably improved image quality and outdoor performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our proprietary display test. On the Xperia pro, we were only able to do our display test with the screen brightness set to the maximum, as once you select anything other the maximum setting the light sensor kicks in and starts automatically controlling the screen brightness. And since we conduct our test in a completely dark room that would lead to inaccurate results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen we find the usual set of controls. The hardware Back, Home and Menu buttons do look a bit crammed up together but actually more comfortable and solid to press compared to the Xperia Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty crowded above the display: there?s the earpiece, an ambient light sensor, the secondary VGA camera and a proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand side of the Xperia pro has the 3.5mm audio jack and the tiny Lock/Power key. It seems to be comfortably placed to reach with a forefinger if you wrap your right hand around the device. It's so small though that it's almost impossible to press this way. We found we had to press it with a fingernail to be sure it will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the top right, there is the thin volume rocker and a microHDMI port under a small plastic lid. There?s a tiny status LED next to the HDMI port. On the other end is the two-step shutter key. It's stiff and small - just like on the two Arcs. What makes it worse here is the form factor. Every time we tried to push the shutter key all the way down, the slider gave in and moved up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top we find the centrally placed microUSB port. The lanyard eyelet is the only thing at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the Xperia pro open reveals its key feature: the four-row QWERTY keyboard. There's a setting allowing you to enable Smart Keyboard, which Sony Ericsson claim will give you instant access to relevant functions but it just didn't work on our unit. The slider motion unlocks the screen and that's that. We should warn against a minor wobble to the slider, which may or may not deteriorate with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the keyboard itself, it uses the exact same layout as the Mini pro but the well-spaced keys enjoy more room and that's all to the user's benefit. The keys are prominent enough with nice matte finish, the press feedback is good. This is one of the most beautifully lit keyboards we've seen too. Each key is outlined by a thin thread of light and the symbols are nicely illuminated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro has the 8MP lens and a single LED flash. The lens is recessed to ensure protection against scratches and smudges. The secondary microphone for active noise cancellation is also nearby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is all the way at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover, at the very end of the battery compartment, which rules out hot-swap. By the way, we had a lot of trouble opening the battery cover. There's no designated place to put a finger and pull up. We ended up scratching the surface to find the slightest opening. The Xperia pro supports cards of up to 32GB and comes with a complimentary 8GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is next to the microSD slot too. The Xperia pro is powered by a 1500mAh battery, which should be enough to last three days of normal usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Pro got a battery rating of 37h in our recently introduced standardized battery test. You can expect 37 hours between charges with an hour of 3G calls, and hour of video playback and an hour of web browsing each day. That?s better than what we are used to seeing from modern-day smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro is reasonably sized and comfortable to use and carry around. It's nearly the size of an Xperia Neo and they did a good job of fitting a QWERTY keyboard there. It's quite an efficient keyboard too, and beautifully backlit. A great physical keyboard and the 3.7? display, this is a full-size messenger many will be willing to consider over the compact mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is well built, though we have our gripes. They're not going to ruin the experience, just something to look out for when trying the phone. There is a wobble in the slider - the bottom of the phone is looser than the top. It's not too worrisome but it's there. The back cover is a hassle to open but let's say you won't need to do that too often. The Power button and the shutter key could've been better. We don't mind the plastic build and the sober styling. The phone looks good and handles well without being a design wonder. Because of the fingerprint issues we wouldn't recommend the black version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 2.3.4 all over the UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro comes with Android 2.3.4 preinstalled. We already saw this version running on the Xperia arc S, but in case you've missed it, let?s go over the new features available. Among other things, the 2.3.4 update brings screenshot functionality, enhanced Facebook integration, swipe text input and USB on-the-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a video of the user interface in action, which is a good starting point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the Xperia pro has a five pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung do in TouchWiz. However widgets here are not crammed in small hard-to-read screens. Instead, they?re all shuffled on a single screen, so they can better use the space and remain as big as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro has some custom-made Sony Ericsson widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher puts shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid. You can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually shuffle the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is simple, using the iOS logic (and visual layout). You drag one icon over another and a pop-up prompts you to select an icon and a name for the folder you?re about to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard Xperia fare. Which means you get notifications for Facebook events too. The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - the Take Screenshot shortcut. It's found in the power settings and you need to press and hold on the Power/Lock key to access it. It would have been better if Sony Ericsson has made it with a combination of two keys (like the iOS's Home+Lock combo) rather than a virtual shortcut, but at least it's there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. Timescape has a tabbed structure, allowing you to filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you not only see the latest activities and updates of your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or return a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of the new Timescape is that you can set it as a homescreen widget. It will show all of your updates as tiles. You no longer need to sacrifice all your homescreen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all these functions are not enough, there are free Timescape plugins on the Android Market for Sony Ericsson users. There are already plugins for mixi, Foursquare, Orkut, Gmail, Music, Photo, etc. extensions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarking the Xperia pro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset has been around for a while and we know what to expect from it in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson already used this chipset in most of its latest smartphones. As we suspected the Xperia pro showed similar results on the synthetic benchmarks as the Xperia ray. The video benchmarks are on par too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. Info for each contact is presented in side-swipable interface that holds contact info, recent calls and more info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can ?join? their contact info to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia pro as every other Xperia phone does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro automatically disables the touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro. Scoring a Good result, the Xperia pro isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might occasionally miss a call. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden in the Sound settings is xLOUD, a feature that claims to improve speaker loudness. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>xLOUD made a difference of about 5dB when you sum up the tests, maintaining the Good score. You should also know that placing the device down on its back doesn't seem to muffle the sound ? it gets amplified a few decibels instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flawless messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use search to locate a specific message in all conversations. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia pro offers a just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even on the portrait keyboard, typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The Xperia pro is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But who actually cares about those virtual keyboards, when you have the real deal - a full four-row QWERTY keyboard at your disposal. After all you this should be the sole reason the buy the Xperia pro. And guess what? The keyboard turned out to be excellent, as we already talked in our hardware section. It's the fastest and easiest way to do all the typing and you will be pleased for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about the T9 Trace swipe input. It works the same way as the Swype we already met in lots of Galaxy phones - instead of tapping on keys you sweep a finger across the keyboard. Even if you never used Swype input before, you'll get used to it fast and embrace it. There is also setting for automatically put Space between the words, so you don't need to every time you "swipe" a word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, why not Swype, but swipe or trace. It works the same way both in usability and precision, so you shouldn't really care about the name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have noticed the 3D switch by now at the top. It opens a different gallery section that stores only your 3D panorama shots. The standard camera photos and panoramas are in the familiar camera folder in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the 3D panoramas, you need to connect your phone to a compatible 3DTV. We tried them on the LG Optimus 3D, but the device couldn?t recognize them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added support for Facebook albums too. They are distinguished by the small Facebook logo on them and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Thanks to the Xperia ray's multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors, as it sharpens the image and reduces noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but the high-density screen of the Xperia ray makes them invisible. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend you keep it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The native video player is a disappointment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia pro as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia pro did play a 720p MP4 video (but not 1080p). And the 3.7? FWVGA Reality screen offers excellent image quality (the BRAVIA engine comes into play here too) and spot-on aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you re-encode your videos before hand, the Xperia pro can make a good PMP. Or you could just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier. This would address other deficiencies of the Xperia pro video player, like lack of subtitles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia pro is the same app you get in the Xperia ray, the Xperia arc S. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. You also get Silent mode, which mutes all other sounds except for alarms - great for uninterrupted listening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Gallery, the Music player on the Xperia pro lets you "like" tracks you're listening to, which posts it on your wall. Later on, you can discuss them with your friends through the Friends' music and videos app (sometimes called Media discovery). There's a widget too, so you can always be up to date with what you're friends are listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro did reasonably well in our traditional audio output test. It got some good scores here and there and was reasonably loud so most users won't have much to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the really impressive scores are achieved with the smartphone connected to an active external amplifier. In that case the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro hasn't got a single weak point to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, when you plug in a pair of headphones the stereo crosstalk rises beyond what we consider good, there's some distortion to be noticed and the frequency response deviates a little (though, that one remains pretty good). The noise level and dynamic range remain unaffected, but the overall performance in the second part of the test was pretty mediocre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera offers Sweep Panorama<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro boasts an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. Much like the Xperia ray, arc and arc S, the Xperia pro uses an backlit Exmor R sensor, which promises improved low-light performance. Our experience with these sort of sensors is that they indeed offer lowered noise levels but the improvement is nothing that major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia pro are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. The left one holds five shortcuts to various settings, while the right one shows thumbnails of the five most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pull to expand the settings taskbars or push them out of sight. It?s a clever solution that lets you pick how much of the camera controls are seen in the viewfinder. The shortcuts in the left column can be rearranged and you can replace some of them with others from the extended menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between five capture modes - Normal, Scene recognition, Smile detection, Sweep Panorama and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia pro take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two panorama modes are the additions brought by the Android 2.3.4. The Sweep Panorama option is available in lots of Sony portable cameras, so it should be familiar to some of you. Anyway, it?s very easy to take a panorama - you just follow an on-screen slider until you reach the end and your panorama shot is taken. Unfortunately you can't choose how long it will be, you have to shoot it until the slider run out. If you are too slow or too fast you'll have to start over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on which panorama mode you have chosen, you will be able either to view your 2D shot (4912x1080 pixels) on your Xperia pro or take it on a 3D TV and see it there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other settings include changing the resolution, toggling between front/back camera, photo light (but it's switched manually, not automatically as a flash), geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode. Also at your disposal are a self-timer, shutter sound, exposure, white balance and metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good - noise levels are kept relatively low and there is enough fine detail, although not the best in the 8MP league. Photos have good contrast and good though oversaturated colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama shots are captured with 4912x1080 pixels resolution and if you take them with a tripod they will be assembled perfectly. If not, you'll be surprised to out the pictures are almost as good as tripod enhanced ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a couple of shots in poor lighting so you can see the high ISO result for yourself</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro to our Photo Compare database. The tool?s page has a quick how to guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro performed very well on all the three charts, producing enough amount of detail and pleasant colors. Compared to similar Exmor R-bundled siblings, the Xperia pro turned to be equal or even better.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro captures 720p video at 30 fps and does a very good job of it. The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera - focus mode, metering, exposure value and image stabilization are all user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 format (6Mbps bitrate) and the frame rate nails the 30fps mark. The amount of captured detail is very good and so are the colors (though they're oversaturated again). Contrast is good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of detail drops a bit in the dark as noise reduction fights to keep videos mostly noise free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders. You'll find it a good match or even superior for the latest Gingerbread running HTC and Samsung single-core droids.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity, but you may consider a dock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro has a good deal of connectivity options. The basics are covered by quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) and Bluetooth 2.1 for wireless local connectivity. The Connected devices app turns your Xperia pro into a DLNA server, letting you view media on DLNA-enabled devices (e.g. TV, PlayStation 3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB v2.0 port handles both wired data transfer and charging. With the Android 2.3.4 Xperia pro supports USB on-the-go, but you have to buy the Sony Ericsson Live Dock to be able to use it. When you get the accessory, you can connect USB Flash drives, keyboard and mouse to your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LiveWare manager app lets you assign specific apps to be launched when a given accessory is connected, which can be quite handy (e.g. launch music player when you plug in headphones or a file browser for flash memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage has 240MB only available to the user, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone ships with an 8GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack and a micro HDMI port complete the connectivity tally. There is no micro HDMI cable included in the retail box, but usually is a market dependent feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser everybody likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, with almost no visible chrome by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 3.7? screen for web browsing. The Xperia pro browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing performance is excellent - panning, zooming and the text reflow are blazing fast. The Xperia pro web browser is an example of how a mobile browser should look and behave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. YouTube videos played smoothly at 360p, 480p and even 720p - no dropped frames and audio lag. It seems the new Flash 11 is much optimized than it?s the 10.x versions. Flash games played trouble free too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support both for viewing (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions) and editing/creating (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) document files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on the high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with both Gmail and the generic email app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. The generic Email app even lets you download the attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for Agenda: a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Events appear just like regular events but you can't edit them from the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can pull out advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either. There's plenty of those in the Android Market though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation: Google Maps and Wisepilot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro comes with a GPS receiver, which took less than 3 minutes to get satellite lock from a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks or the network positioning if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with Maps 5.6.2 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings, two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, those features aren?t available everywhere. 3D buildings are available mostly in the biggest world cities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view is, as usual, a part of the standard package - it gives you a panoramic view of every bit of road in the covered areas. With the compass mode enabled, it feels like a virtual tour of the place!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia pro came with Wisepilot pre-installed with full navigation license. It took it really long to get a GPS lock with every GPS setting turned on, but then it does what a SatNav software is supposed to - navigate (with voice guidenace). There are weather and traffic information too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just can't promise you your Xperia pro will also come with the same Wisepilot license, it may be a market-dependent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps expanding with apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia pro runs the latest version of Android and has a FWVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market. The MSM8255 chipset should be able to handle most apps in there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market had another visual boost lately plus a layout redesign. Now you get a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-app section is untouched though and we still find it quite unattractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the company's squad of droid smartphones is now complete with a QWERTTY messenger. It's the kind of phone that can enjoy demand from both business users and social networking fans. The entire Xperia lineup was thoroughly refreshed and ready to offer the Android experience to users of all backgrounds and ages. It was recently confirmed too that all the company?s recent smartphones would get the Ice-cream Sandwich update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson should probably next focus on future proofing the hardware as well. Although still a rumor at this point, a dual core phone with an HD touchscreen is already in the works. And who knows, it may be Sony without Ericsson to announce the next flagship. But well, that?s for the future to tell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Away from flagships ? and speculations ? the Xperia pro is here and now and more than decently spec'd for the intended audience. The screen size and resolution are more than adequate, the QWERTY keyboard is great. There?s a solid office and organizer package right out of the box ? and the Android Market is the limit. The social and imaging skills are not just a bonus, they add an extra dimension. Even without dual core under the hood, the Xperia pro is by no means underpowered. And it can squeeze more life of the 1500mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QWERTY messengers may seem to have gone out of fashion but Sony Ericsson beg to disagree. They have two of them but different enough to pull in different demographics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in Europe and want meaningful competition, you need to roll all the way back to the Desire Z and the Milestone 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They?re both already running Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the more recent Motorola MILESTONE 2 even manages to match the screen resolution and processing power of the pro. The Xperia messenger doesn?t have the aluminum unibody of the Desire Z or the solid feel of the Milestone. It offers an 8MP camera instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire Z ? Motorola MILESTONE 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E7 is another option and it?s soon to get Symbian Belle. We were impressed with the latest update of the OS and it?s certain to make a difference to an already solid business package. The E7 boasts a ClearBlack AMOLED screen, USB-on-the-go, HDMI and penta-band 3G. The anodized unibody and lifetime sat-nav license are welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re shopping for a QWERTY messenger, Sony Ericsson have the most recent models. The competition seems less interested in this form factor. And the different styling tells a lot about a changing market. Old school is cool: the metal-clad messengers of the older generation are solid and physical, more grown-up. But strictly business will no longer do. The Xperia Pro has the business acumen but it?s not the nine-to-five type.</paragraph>
