			<paragraph>Love it or leave it won't do here, we're afraid. Love it or hate it is more like it. There's so much to get excited about with Nokia N78. The excellent display and capable camera, topped with Navi wheel, FM transmitter, GPS and Wi-Fi sure round off a nice deal. And yes, the latest FP 2 is a downright treat. If only? Well, you must know already what we think of the package. Anyway, you're welcome to read on. Nokia N78 has a whole review up ahead to unleash its potential and a lifetime to beg for a facelift.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 stacks up just below the top of the multimedia phone market. The megapixel count and screen size are probably the only things to stop it from directly competing with the N95. It is still quite close and even offers a few features that the omnipresent Nseries ruler lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice - even if somewhat humble - alternative of Nokia N78 is Samsung i550w. Carrying a very similar feature-pack, it trades the FM transmitter and the Navi wheel for a trackball and a larger 2.6" screen. The best part about the Samsung is that it costs a great deal less than the Nokia N78, retailing at about 260 euro. Now, the FM transmitter and FP 2 are not exactly the first things one would choose to trade, but we can understand those willing to save themselves some money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handset to rival the N78 is Nokia N82. The best cameraphone by Nokia to date is currently available for about 300 euro. The 5 megapixel camera comes with protective cover and Xenon flash, while a built-in accelerometer is also on offer. On the other hand, N82 too lacks the FM transmitter, which might sound as a deal-breaker to some.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package brings nice surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia N78 fares pretty well in terms of content. The 2GB microSD card is a nice thingy to start with. There is also a microUSB cable included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired handsfree unit is quite stylish (there you go) and comes in two parts. That enables you to separate the remote and use another set of headphones. The box also holds a whole bunch of manuals and a quick start guide introducing you to the phone's main features. A PC sync software CD is the last addition to the generous retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N78 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N78 bar measures 113 x 49 x 15.1mm. Even if it doesn't sound that bulky, in reality the phone is slightly on the hefty side. With the huge number of features aboard however, we aren't really put down by size. Furthermore, the weight of 101.8g won't tear a hole in your pocket either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise Nokia N78 is obviously inspired (shall we say infected) by Nokia N81. Well, it's no secret that we are not in love with those looks and we hardly miss an opportunity to say it out loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 is finished in glossy black at the front and dark brown at the back. The best part of the casing is the brushed light brown surface at the sides. A few metal accents here and there wouldn't have hurt but the materials are still fine as they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major issue with the glossy plastic is fingerprints. It takes only a short while for the Nokia N78 to get all covered in smudges, so prepare for some major cleaning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N78 excellent display takes further advantage of the ambient light sensor, which is placed in the top right corner of the front, along with the video-call camera. The earpiece is dead center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central elements on the N78 front panel however are the 2.4" display and the keypad. Those will be dealt with a little later in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Nokia N78 hosts the dedicated camera key, the volume rocker and a loudspeaker grill. Both the camera key and the volume rocker are large and tactile enough, and provide sufficient press feedback so they are no problem to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite surprisingly the other loudspeaker is placed all the way down the diagonal on the opposite side of Nokia N78. It's found just above the lower edge of the left side. The remaining elements on the left are the charger plug, the microSD card slot and the microUSB port. Of those, only the microSD card slot is hidden under a plastic lid, which makes the USB port prone to filling up with grime and dirt - not to mention that the hole doesn't look all that attractive. The same goes for the charging port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD slot is neatly tucked under its protective cap but things are not as sweet in terms of usability. The problem is that releasing the card is a fiddly job. You would normally need to keep the cap out of the way while trying to eject the card from its narrow slot deep within the surrounding surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at Nokia N78 from above we notice the power key, which is also used for changing the ringing profiles and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. Its location is not that convenient - it's uncomfortable to operate the handset with a pair of headphones plugged in right on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone there's the microphone pinhole and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of Nokia N78 hosts the 3.2 megapixel camera with LED flash. The lens is unprotected and thus vulnerable to scratches and fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really displeased with the battery cover. It does wobble big time and annoying creaks are heard all the time when handling the phone. We are guessing it's the lock mechanism, which is far from perfectly designed. Other than the wobble, the all-plastic lock and side hinges do feel quite fragile and are likely to play up with use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to open the battery cover, you need to press the release button at the bottom and simultaneously lift the whole piece. Once again the latch is rather hard to operate, while the battery cover doesn't feel solid enough and we couldn't help fearing it might break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 is equipped with a BL-6F battery of 1200 mAh capacity. It is quoted at up to 320 hours of stand-by and 4 hours and 20 minutes of talk time, which sounds quite a promise to us. In reality it kept the phone going for about 3 days of moderate usage. yes, we know, that got us totally unexpected too. It may get beter once the battery reaches its full potential after several charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't really nag about the construction quality of Nokia N78. But we just won't let the wobbly back cover get away with it. Honestly, it doesn't feel right. The fingerprint disaster of a surface is the other thing. The rest of the handset is well done. After all, we wouldn't have complained about the wonky rear if the whole thing was one mess of a handset. But it's not, so those little details tend to get on your nerves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: thumbs up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 is equipped with a 2.4" 16M-color display of QVGA resolution. Beside ample size, it did manage to impress us with picture quality. Brightness and contrast levels are excellent and, overall, the display looks even better than that of N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is praiseworthy. Nokia are one of the best when it comes to producing displays that fare well in the sun and N78 makes no exception. Even on the brightest of days you will have little trouble using your N78 outside, albeit the colors are a bit washed out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad - lost in design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of Nokia N78 looks like nothing we have seen. Scratch that, it looks like a front panel is yet to be fitted. Following the Nokia N81 trail has inevitably made a negative impact on usability. That said, we do acknowledge the fact that many are attracted or must have got used to the N81 design. Everyone's free to feel whatever they like about looks. But hey, would the N78 type any sweeter if we called it great?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are fine with the D-pad and the multimedia menu key, which are large enough and provide good press feedback. The Navi wheel functionality (which is now usable in almost every menu) is a welcome bonus. It is in fact quite a fun way to control your handset, but it brings some inconveniences. The problem is that the D-pad is a bit too sensitive and will often trigger a move when you just want to confirm an action, sending you to the wrong menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are far from happy with the Call and End keys, which are utterly flat and placed a bit too close to the edge and thus a little uncomfortable to use. You do eventually get used to that - another flashback to the N81 experience, but this is not as easy as we hoped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is a story of its own. The knobs are way too tiny and there are no borders of any kind between keys within the same row. With all the free space around we wonder why it was necessary to make typing such a challenge with Nokia N78. Even the Nokia N82 keypad, which is not our favorite, is better for texting than this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu and clear keys have somewhat unusual (if you're not into N81, that is) placement on Nokia N78. They are on either side of the keypad and that too raises eye brows in terms of ergonomics. The major problem here is the C key, mostly when used in typing. It way to stranded on the edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of Nokia N78 is strong and even. It does make the phone more attractive to look at in the dark. We are even tempted to say that usability in the dark is trouble-free, but all those ergonomic peculiarities still hold true.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony uncompromised<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia N78 signal reception is simply flawless. The phone offers brilliant speaker quality and the sound during calls is amazingly clear and free of any interferences. Vibration is also strong enough to make sure you never miss an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from our loudspeaker test are at your disposal. Check out the table showing how it stacks along some of the handsets we've put to the same test. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S60 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd Edition user interface. Feature Pack 2 also comes preinstalled, bringing some nice novelties. In fact, Nokia N78 is the first handset to feature the S60 FP 2, bringing both visual and performance upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to notice was the new Active stand-by screen, which now allows quick access to a lot more features. The stand-by can be organized in vertical tabs with the D-pad used for scrolling them. Other than that its functionality isn't greatly modified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by screen is a nice and convenient way to bring shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access. The two soft keys functions can also be varied according to the user's preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the Navi wheel functionality is also improved to show much more of its potential. Other upgrades include improved gallery and geo-tagging of the photos but those will be discussed when the time comes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has also received visual enhancements and is now appearing on every pop-up menu. It is actually placed on top of every list, which may seem somewhat irritating. In addition, you can still use the well-known shortcut by pressing and holding the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some graphic improvements as well. Animations are now available when browsing the menus. Fading in and out of the camera viewfinder looks very cool and really adds an eye-catching to the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 96MB of RAM is an important factor to OS performance. In reality, 96MB is really hard to deplete unless you do it intentionally. Memory Full warnings are not something you can expect on the Nokia N78 screen on a regular basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating the menus is fast with instant response to user commands. The blue circle next to the icon of a running application is a well known Symbian indication reminding users to quit unwanted applications that are still running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78's built-in memory is 76MB, which is a decent count, although nothing spectacular. The included 2GB microSD memory card comes in very handy for extending it but you can go for an even higher capacity card if you like. Our test showed that Nokia N78 had no problem handling an 8GB microSD memory card, even though it did slow down the phone a bit when full. In all other cases, accessing applications or any other files from the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice a big difference compared to accessing content on the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia menu is among the Nokia N78 highlights, as seems to be the case with all other recent Nseries models. It is launched by pressing the dedicated key and provides quick access to the multimedia features of the handset. It is identical to the ones found on Nokia N81 and Nokia N82 with icons sorted thematically. They appear as drop-down lists when the respective tab is selected. If you find the menu layout unsuitable, you can freely rearrange icons to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It's doing a good job, being fully speaker-independent and recognizing a high percentage of the user commands. Its performance still falls short of what the Nokia N95 and N95 8GB were capable of, but not by a great margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N78 main menu offers four different view modes. Two of them are the well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list. In addition, you can choose whether you prefer your icons animated or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe views. Visually appealing though they might be, those are not really the most user-friendly we've seen. Font sizes are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you can change the currently active theme. There are four preinstalled themes on Nokia N78, three of which are named Nseries. The rest is left to the imagination of the user, as many other themes are available for download. Before doing that though, make sure you check out the fourth pre-bundled theme - Haze. We personally happened to find it quite attractive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its Symbian nature, Nokia N78 has an excellent phonebook with virtually unlimited capabilities. There is storage place for practically unlimited number of contacts and fields, with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. We personally find it quite a challenge to think of something Nokia has missed here. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application, although not exactly a part of the phonebook, is also one of Nokia N78's strengths. It holds up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enter the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers. The period can be shortened to save some space but you are quite unlikely to do that, as even with a huge number of calls the log only takes a few miserly kilobytes of memory space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging gets the same keypad treatment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 redefines heavy texter. With a keypad like this, stress is on heavy, big time. However, the software part of messaging partly makes up for that so, if you send a message every now and then - there is still some hope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N78 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The SMS and MMS share an editor. It is the well known intuitive application from previous Symbian S60 smartphones. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that a delivery report can be activated. The reports pop up on the standby screen and are subsequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All it takes to convert a common SMS into an MMS is insert some multimedia content. A nice feature allows resizing pictures automatically for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 also features the dedicated audio message editor. Even if technically a type of MMS, the audio messages must have seemed important enough to people at Nokia to have its own separate editor. You can either record the message on the spot or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very similar to what previous Symbian powered phones have offered. It can download headers only, as well as the whole messages. There is also support for attachments, so Nokia N78 can meet almost any requirement regarding the user emailing needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is another noteworthy Nokia N78 application. It has a huge number of supported audio formats, including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA. The M3U playlists are also managed flawlessly and files are added to the music library by simply choosing the refresh music library option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting your songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available. Tracks are transferred to Nokia N78 via Bluetooth, USB or by simply downloading them from the internet. You can also use a card reader for that purpose and transfer them directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon completing a USB transfer, the phone automatically prompts scanning for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets, which is a good count in our point of view. If it still seems insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 also comes complete with the A2DP profile support. This means that you will be able to listen to your music on a Bluetooth stereo headset. We had no problem connecting the N78 to a set of third-party headphones we had laying around in our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We certainly hoped that the audio quality of Nokia N78, unlike that of Nokia N82 would be at a good level but, unfortunately, this was not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our audio quality test showed that N78 has problems in several areas including extremely high intermodulation distortion and total harmonic distortion levels. The rest of the reading are also far from being impressive, save for the decent frequency response. So, even though the 3.5mm standard audio jack provides compatibility with a huge variety of headphones, you shouldn't set your hopes too high in terms of audio quality.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 features Real player for playing your video clips. The video player can be displayed in both portrait and landscape mode and can be switched to fullscreen. As you might have guessed, watching a video clip on a screen with this kind of picture quality is really enjoyable. The generous size is also a welcome benefit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in full screen, the softkey functions are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing experience and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N78 has a nice simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It has RDS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If internet connection is available, the Visual radio application can download all the local stations and save them to the handset with their names.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM transmitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time for one of the most interesting features of Nokia N78 - the built-in FM transmitter. It allows you to broadcast your favorite tracks over a predefined radio frequency. Those can then be picked up by any device with an FM radio receiver in the vicinity. The signal strength of the N78 is not that good and in city environment it loses when compared to the Sony Ericsson W980, which we reviewed a couple of weeks ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM transmitter application has a really nice and simple user interface and might do the job of a CD changer in your car for example. However it fails to transmit the artist and track info over RDS like the Sony Ericsson W980 did and all you get displayed on your receiver is "Nokia".</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D Gallery improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia N78 is simply great with the 3D rotating view. The Navi wheel is in its element here. It isn't bringing any kind of superior functionality, but is really fun to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Feature pack 2 also brings some really cool improvements to the gallery application. The browsing system is now improved with the speed of browsing your pictures increasing if you hold the direction buttons on the D-pad longer. This allows quick skipping through tons of photos in a blink of an eye. Besides, the gallery has a much more conveniently placed shortcut for accessing the picture details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, no changes are to be seen here in terms of features - pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and zoomed in up to 800% (not that anyone would actually need that much). Overall, picture browsing and zooming is really fast with almost no hanging even with larger photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also offers a nice slide show with customizable settings, including automatic browsing and playing a pre-defined track from your music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management functionality (which even includes sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and you bet Nokia N78 can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an application manager to take care of the installed applications on Nokia N78. Not much to talk about here, as it is identical to the one in any other Symbian device. Its functionality boils down to providing details about installed applications, removing them and keeping a log of movements in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard the Nokia N78. Its reserved line in the active stand-by menu no longer comes as a surprise. After all, an application this useful deserves to be conveniently placed. The application itself finds almost every item in your Nokia containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and then all results are shown.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3MP Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N78 is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It sports auto-focus and LED flash but unluckily no protective mechanism whatsoever. This means that the glass protecting the lens is extremely prone to scratches and finger smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the hip camera features is the geotagging capability, which by the way works with videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though not a 5-megapixel top-of-the-shelf cameraphone, the Nokia N78 camera UI is the same as in N95 8GB. It offers extensive settings - starting from manual white balance and ISO sensitivity and including exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast settings. Various effects are also at hand, labeled color tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gridline can be applied to the viewfinder to assist you in framing you photos, using the photographic rule-of-thirds. Using it to align your subjects and place points of interest on or near the lines and their intersecting points makes your photos more professional and aesthetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 UI Feature Pack 2 also enables tagging of your pictures. In addition to geo-tagging, which is automatically handled by the built-in GPS, you can also tag any keyword you can think of to your photos. These should help you organize and find your pictures easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Nokia N78 is quite good. The colors are really precise and the noise is kept to a very low level, except in the shadow areas. There is also more than enough detail and even foliage seems to come out well with the N78 camera. The sharpness levels are also very good with no traces of excessive sharpening. It seems that internal processing includes some time of shadow correction, which generally produces good results, but might look unnatural in some scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the sample photos made with the camera of Nokia N78.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the N78 camera shoots in VGA resolution at 15 fps. Although this is a decent achievement, the quality is not that impressive. The modest frame-rate is taking the fun out of the nicely sounding VGA resolution. Videos are captured in MPEG-4 format and have automatic or manual white balance. The other available features are night mode and color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video (6MB)</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connecting people<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers are a treat with Nokia N78. Every common data transfer medium is supported. USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP just start the count. All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - from GPRS, through EDGE to 3G with HSDPA support - Nokia N78 has it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the wireless communication tally, Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. A nice improvement coming with the FP 2 now allows for quick locating of hidden wireless networks. This was also possible with the previous Nokia handsets but took a lot more time as the WLAN wizard had to be used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the memory card slot, is here and comes in handy if you have a card reader at your disposal. The missing thing with Nokia N78 is the Infrared port but we are not going to pretend that we are even slightly missing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser scores a point<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet with Nokia N78, like with all Nokia smartphones, is a pleasure. No matter how elaborate the web page, it fits perfectly on the screen and looks almost exactly like on a PC. The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level is also adjustable at the expense of only a few key presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large amount of RAM is surely one of the best things that could happen to the browser, as it is one of the most RAM-demanding applications indeed. Now, even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background, you are extremely unlikely to run out of RAM. The 2.4" display is not as impressive as the 2.8" screen in Nokia N95 8GB but still makes even the finest prints readable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia N78 are really top-notch. Just name the application and you can count on it that the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has three different types of view - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel and PDF files seamlessly. Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included version of the Quickoffice. If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application at the Nokia Download center. The final ingredient here is the included ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to get into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games wanted<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are a game lover the Nokia N78 preloaded content is only going to bring disappointment. There was no preinstalled game on our unit, although it's an off-the-shelf unit. In addition, when we tried to install the N-gage application we kept getting incompatibility alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, there are plenty of third-party games out there so Nokia N78 users can easily download both native and java titles. N-gage support could be added for this model too. We just can't understand if it was that hard for Nokia to put a few just as a taster, it's not an E-series unit after all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is the pleasant surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the two N95 editions and the N82, Nokia N78 has a built-in GPS receiver. Having tested all of them it's safe to conclude that Nokia N78 is by far the best performer in the lot. Its receiver is way more sensitive and the slow initial satellite lock problem is completely solved. Only about 30 sec are needed for the N78 to achieve lock upon cold start. You can also activate the built-in A-GPS to reduce this time even further. Have in mind though that data transfer charges apply in this case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in GPS receiver works with the Nokia Maps application, which is one of the software applications to offer the most detailed maps. Furthermore, it is free and relatively easy to use as far as the most basic functionality is concerned. What's even better, with Nokia N78 it comes with 3 months of free voice-guided navigation. You should bear in mind though, that this is not applicable to every market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't want to use Nokia Maps you can go for a third-party application as there are quite a lot of those available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we have to admit that the Nokia Maps application itself is not bad at all and has little to complain about. It has very decent looks and easily customizable route planning algorithm. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. The route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as an electronic map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the Nokia N78 GPS functionality is extremely positive, if not the best we have had with a mobile phone. It will hardly leave even the most demanding users disappointed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First things first, we have to admit Nokia N78 really has some serious performance to back up that specs sheet. The new and improved interface is real snappy and there are a few nice surprises in store. The time-tested smartphone and multimedia strengths are topped with a capable camera, great GPS receiver and even a FM transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our dilemma here is whether to throw another if only at you. All right, we'll just say that "can't have it all" is but a lame excuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And no, it's not a matter of personal taste - some things boil down to numbers. Right now Nokia N78 retails at about 30 euro more than what you'd pay for a Nokia N82. If you are not among those mesmerized by the looks of N78, you might end up trading the FM transmitter and better GPS for a 5 megapixel camera with xenon flash and saving a few bucks. Still with prices possibly leveling out, some time from now Nokia N78 might just turn out a better deal than it currently is.</paragraph>
