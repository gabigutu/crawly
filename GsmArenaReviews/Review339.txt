			<paragraph>Combining the sleek styling of Samsung's slimmest and good looking phones with the high-speed technology of HSDPA and Wi-Fi, the SGH-i600 is a bar-shaped smartphone with up-to-date email and messaging services. Being rich in features it handles almost every need, yet disappears easily into your pocket when not in use. The slim and compact SGH-i600 does just that and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to Windows Mobile-based smartphones, it is not exactly a huge variety of brands that you can choose from. The major manufacturer on the market can be easily identified in face of HTC with its palette of smartphones and PocketPC's that come in different form factors. With a bunch of applications and features, their biggest drawback is weight and dimensions. Furthermore, the standard applications in the Windows Mobile OS are invariable in every consequent device that comes to the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Korean giant Samsung has wisely focused its effort in making lightweight and compact smartphone device, simple but stylish enough, sporting unique applications and latest communication capabilities. This is just the base you can expect of Samsung i600 smartphone. You can spot the bag of novelties even with a quick preview of the thin handset - among them are the handy card wheel home screen interface, uMenu application, multi-purpose thumbwheel, integrated Contents Manager software, a useful RSS Reader, complex Wake-up alarm, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung's i600 place on the market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i600 is the successor of Samsung i320, which is the first QWERTY Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone of the Korean company. It is not the design that can instantly distinguish Samsung i600 from its predecessor, but the communication capabilities, including Wi-Fi and 3G, VGA video call camera and a few new software applications. In terms of this functionality the new star sadly lacks stereo speakers, Infrared port, camera flash and the major drawback - the powerful Intel PXA 272 (416 MHz) processor housed in Samsung i320 is illogically replaced with TI OMAP 1710 (220 MHz) processor in Samsung i600. The increased need of a powerful processor in the new model is imposed by the 3G and Wi-Fi functionality (video streaming, data transfers, etc.), multitasking and the available upgrade of Windows Mobile 6 Standard OS. This makes the decision for processor downgrade in Samsung i600 look rather unexplainable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in Samsung i320, the new handset features 128 MB ROM and 64MB RAM, with 48 MB of the latter being available for the user making up for a good performance. Samsung has also added a microSD (TransFlash) memory card slot to enable expanding the memory. Samsung i600 allows you to access the memory card as a Mass Storage device on your PC. In other words, the phone can also be used as a portable drive. Both phone memory and the memory card are also accessible through TCP/IP and ActiveSync protocols making picture copying, ringtones saving, etc. a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get our attention back to i600. It is not that glossy superstar you'd probably expected, yet it is pretty comfortable at touch, packed with functional QWERTY keyboard and light touch soft keys. When it comes to ergonomics, the Samsung i600 is one of the best performers among the QWERTY smartphones currently on the market. Being 11.8 mm thick and 59 mm wide it is more compact than most rival models, and is by mere 0,3 mm thicker than Motorola Q. Other available QWERTY Windows Mobile based smartphones that might be of interest to high-end technology addicts are the HTC S630, powered by a 400 MHz processor, and featuring HSDPA, EDGE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a 2 megapixel camera and the Motorola Q 9h handling EDGE, HSDPA, Bluetooth, and 2 megapixel camera. Also worthy of mentioning is the rival Symbian S60-based Nokia E61i and the Symbian UIQ-based Sony Ericsson P1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, Samsung i600's dimensions are even comparable to regular phones if you don't mind the width, plus it is even lighter than most recent handsets on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Casing is practical<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling Samsung i600 is very pleasing, managing applications and phone functionality is really enjoyable. The entire back and side panels are finished in soft to touch rubber-like black plastic, ensuring better scratch-resistance. It hardly catches any fingerprints, but when it does, they are also really hard to clean away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available slots are suitably covered with soft plastic, adding to the phone's sleek styling and keeping dust and moisture away. A set of resourceful hardware decisions are integrated, namely the Thumbwheel, the flattened soft touch Send, End, Home and Back keys, which all feature 2-functions, as well as a 4-way navigation D-pad with comfortable OK confirmation key inside, etc. There are no colorful LED status indicators for Bluetooth and battery which is in no way something to mourn about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel sports an earpiece slot with a metal finished stripe placed on the top center. Sound quality provided by the earpiece is on high level in both volume and sound quality. In the top right corner, next to the earpiece slot is the VGA video calls camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper part of the left side shelters the dual-volume keys and the flap-covered headset/power/USB port. Similarly positioned on the upper part of the left side are the flap-covered microSD memory card slot, the Thumbwheel and the Back/Clear key. In all fairness to the Thumbwheel we have to admit that its ease of use allows quick and easy scrolling through menu options and files, while in the same time you press it to confirm and select items in the menu. Even more, a long press of the thumbwheel key accesses Samsung's brand-new solution called uMenu, containing shortcuts to your favorite functions, conveniently placed on the right part of the display. We will come back to that later in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the top end reveals a power button and eyelet for a carrying strap. The power button again has double functionality - when long-pressed - it invokes a well known QuickList menu with a set of profiles and other features: power off, wireless manager, key lock and device lock. The bottom of i600 pretty bare and there are no elements worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel has a swelling in its upper part, housing the mirror, main camera lens and the speaker grill. The battery cover is located on the lower half of the panel, firmly staked, yet easy to be opened. Samsung i600 relies for its power supply on a Li-Ion battery with 1200 mAh capacity. Under rather intense exploration (using a 3G network, Wi-Fi, music player, shooting video and photos, Bluetooth, etc), it will last up to 2 days. This is not really an exceptional performance for such a device but it is not disappointing either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i600 is nice when held in hand and we truely enjoyed using it. It fits great into the palm and its user-friendliness impresses from the very first moment you have a go with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile goes landscape<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i600 sports a clear and bright landscape-oriented TFT display with QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) resolution measuring 2.3" (41 x 35 mm), showcasing 65K colors for excellent viewing of multimedia applications and documents. It has 5 levels of backlighting, being crystal-clear even at the 3rd level. Color nuances are well represented, contrast too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Innovative QWERTY Keyboard - aren't keys a bit small?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A block with the main functional keys, placed in the middle of the front panel, divides the display and the QWERTY keyboard. In the middle of the block keys is located a large 4-way navigation D-Pad with comfortable OK confirmation key inside, slightly lifted, compared to the adjacent buttons. On the left is the Home key, which when long-pressed invokes the task manager, as well as the left soft key and the large Send key (a long press during a call will start the speakerphone). On the right side of the navigation D-pad are the right soft key, the back/clear key and beneath is placed the End Key (a longer press locks the phone). All the keys are large enough and operated remarkably well. And finally, beneath the keypad at the very bottom you will find the microphone pinhole - nothing special to mention here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What about the QWERTY keypad? The phone's compact dimensions had inevitably reflected over the keys size - they are not as big as you'd like to, especially compared to already mentioned alternatives, available on the market. However, with a little practice tackling the rounded buttons becomes easy and provides better typing experience. The keypad consists of 37 keys arranged in 3 main rows and a forth one used for specific functional keys. The keys are black with white symbols on them, except for the numeric keys, which are dark-grey. Each key serves two symbols, but only one of them is active, even if pressed simultaneously and logically is circled with a white line, showing their integrity. The only exception is the 0-key, which is twice the size of any other key. A subject of intense criticism is the lack of dedicated keys for both phonebook and internet, with only one available for messages, located in the bottom right part of the keyboard. The white keyboard backlight is bright and even.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Software innovations - we like them!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung merits special admirations of its strength in altering the core functionality of WM 5 OS, tackling with applications of major importance for fast and user-friendly performance. The Samsung R&amp;D department has done a great job at adding their personal touch to the software equipment of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our favorite among the Samsung software enhancements is called uMenu, a shortcut menu to your favorite functions, which suitably pops up in the right part of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This application is yesterday's news in Symbian OS based smartphones, but in WM smartphones is only available through third-party paid software. You can start the uMenu by pressing the Thumbwheel for 3 seconds. It is up to the user to choose from the two layouts: (1) thumbnails view, showcasing thumb icons of shortcuts, files or links, and (2) list view (featuring small icons with captions). Experienced users will probably appreciate the first view, as the big thumbs are virtually the same as the ones in the usual menu. At the top part of the uMenu with thumbnails view you see the name of the currently selected application. At the bottom are located the free RAM indicators measured in percentage and the current time. A drawback is that only 3 icons at a time are available on Thumbnails view. If you deal with numerous files, links or applications at a time the List view is surely going to suit you better. It is more illustrative with its 7 icons with captions.The uMenu is fully customizable through menu options (right soft key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Samsung i320, software developers make their best to broaden the palette of Home screen layouts and the effect is obvious - user has a vast choice of layouts to pick up from - apart of the standard set, available in WM 5 OS, other include Card Wheel, Samsung Simple, Samsung Popup, Samsung Calendar, and Samsung Clock layouts. However, color schemes are still limited to Default, Guava Bubbles (core WM 5 OS scheme), and Black Scheme. You may use the standard background image or a custom one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Card wheel manages well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A subject of profound discussion is the default Home screen layout dubbed as "Card Wheel".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Card wheel layout is colored in violet-dark-blue with graceful nuance overflow and as the names says, represents flipped, overlapping tabs, with different functionality and interface. It consists of 7 cards-style based tabs (each tab with altered right soft key functionality), shortcutting to the following functions:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Profile - a profiles manager. If you change the name of a profile through Settings&gt;Profile, it will also be properly displayed here. Unfortunately, you cannot change the icons and if you apply a loud ringtone to the silent profile and change the name, the typical icon with banned microphone will remain. The RSK (right soft key) function leads to the Quick List tab for changing profiles, which is otherwise available when you press the power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My photos - displays pictures as thumbs which you can scroll sideways. Those are otherwise available from the Pictures &amp; Videos folder. Pressing the thumb opens the image rather slowly with the proprietary Samsung Picsel Viewer. If you have private-information photos, be sure to keep them in a different folder or they will automatically get displayed in the card wheel "My Photos" slide. The RSK function here is Thumbnails (a shortcut to Pictures &amp; Videos folder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recent Songs - displays your recent track and shifts to Now Playing card wheel menu, once you press the desired track. The RSK responds to "Library". In Now Playing mode this tab shows info on the currently playing track with start/pause button. There are also next and previous song buttons available. The RSK will take you to the stylish fully customized by Samsung Windows Media Player 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Favorite contacts - you might add 10 entries of phone numbers plus their contact pictures. The phone book will be opened if you hit the RSK.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message center - includes items: voicemail (RSK calls it), Missed (RSK invokes Call History), Text Messages (RSK suggests New), Outlook E-mail (RSK starts New). The Message center is the only card where RSK has different functionality in accordance to the selected item on message center tab. However, you might directly press the OK button to start each of these applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Appointments - expands appointments from the calendar. In the card wheel dedicated menu only the first forthcoming appointment is displayed with no option to slide directly to the adjacent appointments, which is a major illogical drawback in this tab. The RSK will lead you to the Calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the card wheel is great - it enhances the home screen with numerous one-touch-away handy applications. However, apart of already mentioned drawbacks some fixes are necessary to be done, in order to achieve better user experience - if you have a current event, namely, missed call, incoming message, you have to scroll to the dedicated card wheel menu so as to access the application, which is inconvenient. Every WM fan cheers when the RSK changes functionality, so as that accessing the current event is just one hit away, but it would be even better if when a message comes, the dedicated menu automatically switched and the RSK allowed direct access to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other Home screen layouts are generally the same as the ones revealed in Samsung's i320 review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Grid or List?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two types of menu's layout - grid and list. In grid view you are unable to use numbers as shortcuts to applications but this layout is generally better compared to the standard list-oriented one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only a cosmetic change of the dialing screen; the standard blue screen is replaced by a flashy green-blue 3-D animation that we like a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i600 comes with a standard Windows Mobile for Smartphone phonebook - no changes there. You have multiple fields for entering information on your contacts - even ones you might have never thought of. The phonebook entries are practically unlimited as they depend on the available shared memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i600 comes equipped with speaker independent voice dialing software. All voice tags are created automatically and match names of contacts, applications and documents. Despite the fact the voice dial works best with English names, it handles very well with other non-English names, provided they are not too long or sophisticated for pronunciation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistant works accurately with included programs. The Voice assist program in Samsung i320 performs poorly in phone book, but we generally found it pleasing to use the upgraded version in i600. A suggestion to put a shortcut of Voice assist in uMenu will significantly facilitate the immediate access to it. We've conducted the test in normal office environment, but in very noisy environment you are sure to encounter more mismatches in its performance. Sadly, Voice Assist doesn't work with Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Again there are no changes in interface and functionality regarding messaging - managing text, multimedia and email messages is virtually the same as in every other Windows Mobile based smartphone. MS Direct Push allows for immediate reception of emails as soon as they arrive at the mail server, while typing a one is very convenient with the QWERTY keypad. It is also possible to view e-mail attachments, while the VPN support ensures security through encrypted wireless communications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: poor performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i600 features a 1.3 megapixel camera with fixed focus and no flash. Combined with the poor camera performance and QVGA-15-fps video recordings you should have no positive expectations at all. Generally, for such devices, camera is a mere formality and this one doesn't make an exception to the rule. Probably this is the reason for the camera not having its own dedicated button, and instead it starts with a longer press of the right-side back/clear key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum resolution, in which the messenger takes photos, is 1280 x 960 pixels. Settings are available for shooting mode, size, picture quality, white balance, effects, timer, and frames. Generally, images are greasy, obscured towards edges and blurred. The video clips are recorded at QVGA and 15 fps - acceptable performance for a smartphone, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may also see a sample Samsung i600 video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data transfers and communication<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i600 connectivity capabilities are up-to-date, sporting 3G (HSDPA 1.8 Mbps), EDGE, GPRS (class 10) ,Wi-Fi (version 802.11 b/g), VPN support, Bluetooth 2.0 (A2DP, AVRCP), and USB 1.1. This arsenal is meant for immediate performance - HSDPA boosts data transfer speeds of up to 1.8 Mbps. Users will appreciate the fast connections when downloading multimedia content or using the integrated MS Direct Push. Faster data rates enable the mobile user to access more files in the same amount of time, while providing greater fidelity for streaming video content. On the other hand, with Wi-Fi, users can make cost-effective calls when connected to a Wi-Fi network through a VoIP system. In addition, taking advantage of the super-fast speeds, users can access the internet or connect to other Wi-Fi enabled devices. You can also rely on a VPN support with encryption for enhanced security. Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP and AVRCP support allows wireless streaming of stereo music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also present in Samsung i600 are the default Windows Mobile applications, such as Internet explorer, Calendar, File manager, etc.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alarm extended<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since Samsung i320, the alarm became more sophisticated and functional, and a major improvement is the mp3 ringtone ability. It is possible to set up to 9 alarms with predefined alarm activation, tones, repeat, and snooze options. There is also Wake-up alarm piece of software with three functions for setting different alarm time for each day of the week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>D-Day application is software for creating events, which can be additionally accompanied by specific date and name. A D-Day event again lacks alert functionality, as in Samsung i320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing new in Picsel Viewer as well - it's still that sluggish software for browsing .doc, .xls, .pdf, or .ppt files. It takes good 18 seconds to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Media player 10 is smooth and cool. However, a fresh, more-player-consistent skin is a necessity, oddly neglected by Microsoft developers. Samsung's developers have upgraded the player with their own nice skin, vaguely reminding the default skin of Winamp player. We are not sure whether the sound graphs actually correspond to the actual music, but that can't be of much significance since they look nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of music quality and volume - we were rather pleased to find it at a very high level. The player balances well both the trebles and basses with no distortion even at max volume. The standard earphones, included in the retail package, are comfortable, ergonomic and firmly fit the ear. They have a remote control sporting volume control key and a key for accepting/ending a call. Compared to other Windows Mobile phones with special music-oriented functionality we rank the Samsung i600 among the best ones we've reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contents Manager makes an effort in integrating and managing video, audio, photos and documents but its efficiency is dubious and it's not that better than the standard File explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fully-equipped for Podcasting, this mobile allows you to receive your favorite podcasts anytime and anywhere, while RSS Reader obtains RSS feeds of the latest news, blog updates, favorite shows, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartSearch is software for complex search in the entire phone - each entry in the Smart Search field will look up for a mach in the available software applications and text inputs - messages, emails, contacts, notes, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other standard software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other applications worth mentioning are the Smart converter, Stopwatch, Task Manager and standard games (Bubble Breaker, Solitaire) but as they are standard and simple there is no need of in-depth explanation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung SGH-i600 is a slim, stylish and very compact smartphone. The up-to-date functionality, connectivity and innovative software solutions would allure Windows Mobile users to gladly shift to it. The innovative and competitive trait of "I" series of Samsung was marked since the introduction of i320 and users are pleased to notice the major improvements in this line in face of Samsung i600. As you read the review, extended unofficial information of Samsung i570 running on Symbian 9.1 OS snakes around the internet and it really looks promising. Let us remind you that Samsung has also officially announced the i600's successor, namely the Samsung i620 with slider form factor and killer functionality. All in all, at the current pricing, Samsung i600 is a true bargain.</paragraph>
