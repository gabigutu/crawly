			<paragraph>It's been a long time since we last held such an unusual phone in our hands. Nokia 7500 Prism is so much different from all other mobile devices in terms of design. With its dazzling geometric patterns and distinctive triangular keys, the Prism is one of the most striking phones announced recently. Keeping a low profile is one thing this device can't do. Anyway, stay with us for the good and bad of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7500 has been in the limelight since the very day it appeared on the Chinese website of the Finnish company. With the angular design and a price tag befitting far greater functionality, there is no doubt that this is a love-it-or-hate-it phone. A mere glance at the specification sheets is enough to convince us that Nokia 6300 offers almost the same set of features at a significantly lower price. Shiny plastic and diamond-like shapes on the outside, we are yet to see if its performance is diamond-hard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Out-of-the-box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contents of the package are downright mid level. Alongside a 512 MB microSD memory card, there's a wired stereo handsfree. The earphones aren't as good as the ones found in Nokia 5700, but still produce decent quality sound. Sadly, we found no adapter for the microSD card (making it compatible with standard SD card-readers), nor a USB cable. The DC charger was there but we were disappointed to find out that this phone was using the Nokia AC-3X charger, instead of the AC-5 we found in the Nokia 5700 box. The typical retail package also includes an artificial leather wrist strap, a pouch and two exchangeable color accents. The color accents are very easy to replace and make a surprisingly big difference refreshing the phone's looks. A manual and a booklet highlighting the Nokia 7500 most important features complete the box contents. We should once again make a note here that part of the content of the retail package is market dependant and will probably vary by country or vendor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Triangular plastic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7500 Prism is dressed in black and has a body made of plastic with only a few metal details. Except for parts of the back and the sides, where matt plastic was used, most of the handset's body is shiny, which sadly makes fingerprints an inevitable burden. The device stands at 109 x 44 x 14 mm with a volume of 70 cc and weight of mere 83 g. Overall the construction quality is good and there were no creaks or other disturbing sounds during our test. It does feel good in hand but cleaning your Nokia 7500 is a fulltime job, as every touch on the shiny plastic results in a fingerprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting to inspect the phone exterior, you will find the speaker positioned right above the display. A tiny metal ornament is placed right above it serving a purely decorative purpose. The 2.0" display itself is basically what you would expect in a phone in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Topside you'll find the on/off key, which is slightly sunk to prevent accidental presses. It is enclosed in a thin metal circle and is the only control on this part of Nokia 7500. The top, like the sides, is made of matt black plastic except for the metal framing that goes around the phone and the exchangeable accent. The accents themselves are plastic framework elements of different color, which are inserted under the phone's back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is probably the easiest to describe, as it holds no functional elements at all. The bottom side is much more crowded. It houses the eyelet for a attaching a neck or a wrist strap. Right next to it is the charger plug. Further on to the right you will find the 2.5mm audio jack and the USB slot. Nokia 7500 supports microSD cards, which is nice as those are quite well-spread. So are USB cables by the way, and Nokia must have figured that users are quite likely to have one. As we already mentioned, there's no USB cable in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is where the dedicated camera key is placed. Above it, is the dual volume control key and that is all there is to notice regarding the functionality of this part of Nokia 7500. A great flaw of Nokia 7500 is the lack of hot swap memory card slot. To us it's rather outdated to have to turn off the phone every time you take out or insert the memory card, but apparently not to the phone's designers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is covered with asymmetrical patterns of shiny plastic while the rest of it, as already mentioned, is finished in matt plastic, which may not be as nice looking but deals with fingerprints a whole lot better. The Nokia logo is engraved on the lower half and the camera and the LED flash are located in the upper half. The flash window is also triangular to match the shape, which dominates the phone's design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the battery, the back cover is removed by lifting, starting from the top until you reach the bottom where a triangular button ought to be pushed to fully release the panel. Under the cover is the BL-4B battery and of course the currently chosen color accent goes around the rim. The BL-4B battery is one our greatest disappointments with this phone. Under heavy-duty usage, it was able to last roughly about a day. Our guess is that if you use the phone mostly for talking and do not make too many calls, you will have to charge it every 36 or 48 hours at the most. We could have probably lived with that one if the phone was really feature-packed or at least the display was large enough and of superior quality, but unfortunately neither of those excuses works with this handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking the battery away you will notice the SIM card slot and the microSD card slot. The latter has the lock system, which Nokia usually uses for the SIM cards. We do find it a very nice idea but it's not nearly enough to removing the bad impression from not having a hot-swap slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the keypad. All keys are triangular but surprisingly that didn't bother us at all when typing. It goes to confirm that Nokia does know how to produce a comfortable keypad. Right in the center of the front panel of Nokia 7500 is the joystick. It is a little too rigid for our taste and requires a little extra effort pressing it but, on the other hand, we found it very reliable. There is little chance that it will go slack with time or start losing responsiveness. We will refrain from calling it uncomfortable but we'll note that it does need a little time getting used to. The Call and End keys are on its both sides. The Menu and Clear keys are also a little unusual here, as they are not situated above the mentioned Call and End keys but to their sides instead. Not that it bothered us once we got used to them, but we need to mention that. It probably just adds to the one-of-a-kind image the phone strives to project.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Light, more light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display in Nokia 7500 may not be the largest on a feature phone, but its 2.0" diagonal is just about right, on par with most of its segment competitors. What bothers us here is not the size but the quality of the display - it definitely lacks the brightness of 5700 for example and, despite having a QVGA resolution, it is definitely not the best Nokia achievement in that area. The graphics are smooth and legibility under direct sunlight is very good but still, the overall performance is a bit below the Finnish standards. Nokia has raised the bar really high and now has to jump accordingly, so to say. Well, this isn't the most successful attempt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither backlighting, nor contrast is user-configurable. In the menu you can only set up the phone's behavior, if left inactive. An animated screen-saver can be set up to appear on the display and consequently convert into a screen-saver showing a digital clock, the current date, and icons indicating missed events, if any. All these details are perfectly legible in any light condition. In the menu you will also find a sleeping mode option, when the display goes out completely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7500 signal reception lives up to the high expectations you would have with a Nokia phone - flawless. The loudspeaker is also good and, although we wouldn't completely rule out the chance of missing a call or two in a very noisy environment, we would say this is very unlikely. Ringtone volume is loud enough, making it audible even in crowded places. The vibration of the phone is at decent level but be careful, as with the preinstalled silent profile it is set to off. You will probably have to change that manually to make the profile more usable. In terms of sound during calls, Nokia 7500 is very good and even manages to successfully muffle most surrounding noises, allowing better communication even in noisy places where you usually have to repeat your words a couple of times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: time-proven quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises here. Nokia 7500, alike plenty other Nokia siblings, is built on the Series 40 user interface but this time the 5th Edition was used. In other words, neither the menu, nor the controls of the phone differ much from those in other Nokia models based on the same platform. You will be pleasantly surprised by the wide-ranging user-configurable options of the phone; the drawback is that these make the menu structure somewhat complicated and hard to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in stand-by, the display visualizes not only the pre-selected wallpaper, but in the top bar you can also monitor signal strength, battery state, time, and the icons of any other currently activated functions. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the descriptions of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and to the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The left key is pre-set to serve the Go to menu, where you can insert all your favorite or most used items. The font on the main display can be of any color. Naturally active stand by is also present here. The one implemented in Nokia 7500 consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated in various ways. In the standard case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player and the built-in radio. At the very bottom are displayed events from the calendar set for the current day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two softkeys' functionality is also configurable. The left one however will wait about a second before executing your command. The reason for this is the standard keylock pattern of left selection key and asterisk. So when you press the left key, the phone will wait to see if a lock command is to follow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 7500 can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. Nonetheless, our personal choice was the typical grid view - a matrix of 3x3 icons with legends. The icons are designed with style; the active icon is animated. Icons can be freely re-ordered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other menu levels follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes. There is really a great bunch of such themes on Nokia 7500. No less than 12 of them were to be found on our handset, and most of them went pretty well with the phone's design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. This is probably the greatest benefit of the Series 40 user interface in comparison to other devices on the market. There were also no halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our testing of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Themes for everybody<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned the preinstalled themes in Nokia 7500 reaches the respectable count of 12. Along with the standard Nokia theme, there are 11 extra, which all seem designed to suit the phone's extraordinary looks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The six predefined ringing profiles (seven with the Flight mode) should prove to be more than enough for practically any situation that a Nokia 7500 owner may find themselves in. The flight mode can be used without a SIM card inserted, which is very convenient, especially if you want to make use of your phone as an MP3 player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: Plenty of room<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers space for up to 1000 contacts as well as various configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields; for example 5 phone numbers, email address, website, and street address; birth date, company, job title, and nickname. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems when the phone is synchronized with Outlook. Ringtones can be attached to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears incomparably smaller when you dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can show only the contacts saved in the phone memory or only those stored on the SIM card, or both lists simultaneously. The phonebook appears on the display in one of three available view modes: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. The phonebook font size can also be enlarged, should the user find that necessary. Searching is done by gradual typing of the first name of the corresponding contact. This is a huge downside, as the phone doesn't allow searching by last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last comes the well known grouping: contacts can be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another application worth our complements is voice dial; no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary as its fully speaker independent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 7500 holds no surprises. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 10 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message menu has not undergone any modifications either. It is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 7500 is capable of receiving and sending multimedia messages, sound messages via MMS, and emails. Message type is easily alternated. As soon as you insert a picture or a sound in your message, the SMS editor switches to MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with last recipients in the call register. As you see, everything here is organized in a practical and time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. The phone naturally offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A message can be maximum 1000 characters long. Both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into are constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB. A handy feature of the phone is that it automatically scales down pictures for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is luckily no longer a built-in Java application but the fully functional email client instead, that we have come to know from most Nokia smartphones. It is therefore much faster than the one used in Nokia 6300 for example. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Automatic message download is not user-configurable. There is a simple spam filter for unsolicited mail. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Both message headers only and entire messages can be downloaded, as long as they are no bigger than 300 KB, including the attachments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>XpressMusic player for all tastes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia 5300 music phone and the Nokia 6300. It is an elaborate player with extensive setup options. Besides managing all the typical functions of a music player, it also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player is highly customizable through a number of themes that are at your disposal. We found most of the themes quite eye-pleasing and the sound wasn't bad at all either. Our test revealed it is a bit better than the music-oriented Nokia 5700 in terms of dynamic range but lacks quite a lot in noise level. All in all, the music capabilities of the phone are more than fine for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the retail package you will find a Nokia HS-47 headset. The earphones quality may please you, as long as you do not have big expectations and you tend to use the music player rather occasionally. The handset features a 2.5 mm jack, so substitution for another set of headphones is possible only through an adapter. The sonic experience is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. The equalizers do deserve attention, as they perform very well and have nice graphic visualization. As opposed to most other Nokia models, the selected equalizer has an almost instant effect without the usual few seconds lag. Nokia 7500 has only one loudspeaker located on its rear cover, right next to the camera. It sounds quite well, though. Surprisingly enough, it does not get muffled when the phone body is placed on its back on an even surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with MP3 files, turn on the stereo FM radio. Stations are searched automatically or by direct typing of a specific frequency. The phone can store up to 20 station names. The radio can also be listened through the loudspeaker; just make sure you have your earphones plugged in to serve as an antenna. There is also the Visual Radio function, but it is inapplicable in most countries. We would have definitely appreciated RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode as well as forwarded or rewinded. A nice improvement is the possibility to remove the shortcut key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Up until now sound quality in our reviews has always been a subjective matter. Realizing that mobile phones are evermore used as portable music players subjective doesn?t cut the mustard any more. That is why starting with this review the GSMArena team will be including a new audio test in our reviewing routine in order to give you a more objective view on how the music player of the all those handsets perform. Soon we will publish a separate article which will describe our analysis procedures and will serve as a reference point for all the handsets we?ve had a chance to analyze. For now we will only mark that all the sound tests are done on M-Audio Fast Track Pro external audio interface and RightMark Audio Analyzer 6.0.5 software with special sound samples. This gives us the opportunity to create a controlled environment which should produce accurate and comparable results throughout all the units tested. So here are the results of the Nokia 7500 Prism and its graph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response   Nokia 7500 vs Sony Ericsson K770 ? Nokia 7500 - Normal vs. Pop Equalizer</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery hasn't made a move<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No significant changes in the gallery were made with Nokia 7500. We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models but, as it's used as a file manager at the same time, it is understandable. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is quite slow and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help. You can also edit the picture through the picture editor, but it doesn't offer that many options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders but this still fails to convince us that the gallery is the best Nokia can do. This is the 5th edition S40 and we still expect improvements in this area of the user interface. We do believe that creating a separate application that has less to do with a file manager will benefit user experience with Series 40 phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: Not the Prism's element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Talking about multimedia capabilities, the camera is one of the most important things to mention. Nokia 7500 is armed with a 2 megapixel one with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. Camera settings aren't the richest you can find on the market but no one expected them to be. There are white balance settings, as well as three quality settings going form basic to high. Color effects and sequence shots are also available. The flash can be forced to on, regardless of the light conditions, to use as fill flash. Naturally, an automatic mode for the LED is also available. In terms of performance however, we found the flash quite inadequate. Not that we had any great expectations but still even indoors it doesn't even come close to allowing decent quality pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is also inadequate. It has no lens cover and is only a little recessed to protect it from scratches. Moreover, the metal frame around the camera lens gets scratched far too easily which somewhat spoils the looks of the phone. Although not the most comfortable of all, the dedicated camera button is the beam of sunlight in the camera performance. Photo quality is average; in favorable weather pretty nice images can be produced, sharp enough, with less blown colors. The noise levels are high in areas with no detail like the sky for example. Given the absence of autofocus, you'd rather not take a picture of a closely situated objects or text, as they will surely be blurred. Text is only legible if captured from a distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest disappointment for us was the long outdated QCIF (only 176 x 144 pixels) video resolution. For example Nokia 6233 manages video recording in VGA resolution and costs a great deal less. The length of videos in 3GP format is only limited by the free memory available. Zooming is also an option but, all in all, video capturing can be described as nothing but a flop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regarding connectivity, Nokia 7500 offers passable functionality for this price range. No bells or whistles, but still does a pretty decent job. USB connectivity is the main focus here, as it is truly seamless. Upon connection it prompts you to select the connection mode. You can then alternate these modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory card to be directly accessed from a computer. The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile, which allows stereo wireless connection. This time the Infrared port is not present but we didn't miss it at all. The network capabilities for data transfer include GPRS and EDGE, both Class 10. The lack of 3G yet again underscores that this is a fashion phone rather than a functionally rich handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>On the Web<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7500 has an integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages with WAP 2.0. No significant changes in functionality have been made and it is identical to the one used in Nokia 6300. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set at the smallest font, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browser faces serious competition from another brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java application. The latter is pre-installed and located on the memory card. Overall, the browsing experience is not as enjoyable as with Nokia's smartphones, but it is still at a more than decent level.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time-tested time management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer brings no novelties either, and, frankly, it needs none. Month, week, and day views are available. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: appointment, call, birth date, note, and reminder. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like starting and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily moved into the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length limit is 3000 characters. The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set up to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some other organizing functions available in the phone: voice recorder of 60 minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer, and calculator. The latter is very detailed and offers quite a lot of mathematical functions and even a loan calculator.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Miscellaneous<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The folder containing Java applications is located on the memory card. It features the Sensor application for Bluetooth-based communication. A very nice looking size converter and a unit converter are also to be found there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensor is quite an interesting application, which acts as a Bluetooth instant messenger. It makes the fashion Prism the right kind of device for the fond of blue-jacking and proxidating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size converter will convert size for everything from shoes to clothing and has a rich database including all types of measures (Japan, UK, US etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application is the world clock which allows checking the time in all World time zones at the expense of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will also appreciate the preinstalled applications, as they include four games, which met wide appreciation among the GSMArena team. City Bloxx was already described in the Nokia 6120 review, while 3D Snake is a hallmark in Nokia phones. The version used here is Snake 3 and we rate it among the best ever produced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Guess is about guessing the name of the song played by the phone. It is quite amusing indeed and allows you to make your own library of songs for the purposes of the game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last game is Sudoku, which is a Java interpretation of the popular Japanese game. Navigating the board is easy; the game is as good as played on paper.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Judging a book by its cover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Drawing to the end of our review, it is time to summarize our experience with this particularly strange phone. As it turns out, it is not that eccentric inside, as it is in terms of looks. What's more, after a week or so of working with this handset, we got used to the angular design and it wasn't even that oddly looking to us anymore. If design is high on your list and you're really after a one-of-a-kind device, then Nokia 7500 is your most logical choice. If not though, you better look elsewhere. There is a whole bunch of devices out there to offer the same functionality at a cutdown price. The most obvious alternative is the Nokia 6300. So, basically, buying the Prism or not boils down to choosing your priorities.</paragraph>
