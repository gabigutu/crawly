		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not like we didn't tell you. And hey, it's not like we're on time either. But we guess better late than sorry goes both ways. Once a popular (mostly stateside) PDA and smartphone maker, Palm were going full blast from safe to sorry. So, did they try to put the brakes? Negative. They hit the U turn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many must've doubted Palm ever getting out of the twilight of their dwindling smartphone line. But we're not gonna give you all that crap about second chances. It won't be fair to the Palm Pre. It couldn't have been bleaker for the company but the Palm Pre is not the kind to walk around a with "Will work for food" sign on its neck. No sir. It's looking to elbow its way through a crowd of apples, androids and PocketPCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are we talking the mother of all comebacks here? We honestly don't know. But it looks like a debut of the same magnitude as the iPhone OS, Android and Maemo. The Palm Pre seems to have all the things that made the iPhone so special: multi-touch display, an Application Store, fluid and creative UI and a good web browser. But Palm didn't stop there - the webOS is all about multitasking - to an extent that gives quite a point to those who wouldn't call the iPhone a proper smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The webOS and all the touchscreen gadgetry will sure keep us busy enough. It's the interface and the handling that will earn the Palm Pre its deserved share of admirers. But before we power up this multitasking monster and start navigating its new and unique system, let's look at the package itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs ring the iPhone bell and you may think the Pre is just another copycat - you'll be wrong. The Palm Pre is pushing a brand new OS and doesn't keep a stiff upper lip like some other smartphones - that goes to you Symbian and WinMo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But so much for the resemblance to iPhone. It's a completely different form factor, there are some novel navigation solutions and there's a QWERTY keyboard and multi-tasking. The Palm Pre is a fresh and exciting addition to the world of smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The webOS may have learned a lot from the iPhone OS, but it certainly is trying to do things its own way. The Pre is obviously limited much like the first iPhone and earliest Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the list of do's and don'ts that makes this phone though. It's not the capacitive, multi-touch-enabled touchscreen, it's not the QWERTY keyboard. The Pre hopes to be a symbol of a company's rebirth and promises an exciting time for touchscreen. And it's got a darn good reason to be hopeful: the webOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get there but let's take this one step at a time. The Palm Pre gets unboxed, handled and described right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Palm Pre winks at iPhone, save for a slashed corner. The unusual shape is an eye-catcher, and it feels like it was made with shop windows and shelves in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contents are on the modest side though. The Palm Pre ships with a two-piece charger, a USB cable (it serves the charger too) and wired headphones with a remote/mic. The only bonus piece you get is a black velveteen case with orange inner padding.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Palm Pre 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre doesn't look and feel like the QWERTY slider it actually is. And it's a regular portrait slider too - a true rarity in a world where touchscreen handsets usually get side-sliding full keyboards. The weight of 133 grams is friendly enough and the good hand balance is perhaps the more important thing to note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, to get it straight - it's a Palm phone and the QWERTY keyboard is simply non-negotiable. But the Pre is trying to reinvent touchscreen and a full keyboard is more of an add-on that needs to be out of the way. Last but not the least, the phone needs an identity so it doesn't get lost in touchscreen uniformity. That's too many tasks for the designers already and we guess the Palm Pre pays the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First things first: the simple, organic shape works well for the Pre. Nice friendly attitude, a pebble in your hand. If only it looked a bit more stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic finish is not to blame here. It's not the basic looks or fingerprint issues either. But the unpleasant rustle and creak of plastic rubbing against plastic every time you slide the keyboard in and out is just too much for the money you paid. And the Palm Pre does wobble - you'll feel it as you do the swipes across the gesture area beneath the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rounded shape of the Pre results in a bit of kick-slide profile: the slider bends in to give the screen a slight tilt. The phone is quite secure to hold this way and single-handed typing is comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4-row layout of the trademark keyboard has accommodated well-defined keys with adequate press feedback. There's nothing you can do about the limited space but we think the Pre's QWERTY keyboard can give you reasonable comfort and speed of typing. The keys have some kind of rubbery finish so your thumbs won't slip and the arrangement is pretty standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre has a 3.1" 16M-color TFT display of 320 x 480 pixel resolution. The pixel count is the same as iPhone's but size is well in favor of the iPhone with its 3.5" touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre display, similar to iPhone again, has near perfect sunlight legibility and great backlighting. The keyboard illumination is equally pleasing. Both indoor and outdoor performance is excellent. An ambient light sensor integrated in the earpiece makes sure the display and keypad backlighting turn on when needed. The only difference is notable in direct sunlight where the Palm Pre screen manages to keep colors warmer and more vibrant than the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the screen you'll see the single button, that is the only navigation control the handset has to offer. The whole area around it though is touch-enabled to make the Palm Pre so novel and exciting to handle. This touchpad lets you perform a series of gestures to launch the menu, get one step back in the interface, switch between active applications, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solitary button is a Home key of sorts but the new logic of the webOS makes it a Task Manager too. You see, the whole thing is a multitasking engine with all applications potentially available on the homescreen. But more on that is to follow as we look closer at the Cards UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are small LEDs on either side of the Center key, which are absolutely invisible when the phone is idle. They glow in soft white as your finger sweeps on the Gesture area are recognized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset features the volume rocker only, while the right hosts the standard microUSB port covered with a plastic lid. The Pre can charge off a USB connection, so you can plug it in to your computer anytime you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All there is at the bottom is the battery cover latch. The mouthpiece is in the bottom left corner up front. You can take calls without sliding and the kick-slider form factor has nothing to do with in-call ergonomics. It does provide a comfortable hand-hold for typing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the other sides, the top looks crowded. The 3.5 mm jack, the mute switch and the Power / Lock key are all there. The mute switch is a trademark Palm control, which you get on the iPhone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plain backside of the Palm Pre houses the 3 megapixel camera lens, along with a LED flash and an old-school loudspeaker grill. There is no camera lens protection except slight embedding and the whole rear is made of black glossy plastics that cover in smudges in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is neat and minimalist, with a nicely engraved Palm logo. It doesn't look or feel cheap but the finger-print issues should be noted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you slide the keyboard out, the back of the top part of the phone reveals a mirror surface. It may not be a great benefit but will sure have its uses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 1150 mAh Li-Ion battery. It's said to provide up to 500 hours of stand-by and 5 hours of talk-time in a 2G network or 500 hours of stand-by and 4 hours of talk time on 3G. Based on our experience, a single charge will keep the phone going for as long as four days of moderate use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we guess we can safely move on to the more exciting part of this review - the webOS, the cards interface and all the multi touch and multitasking we can handle. Design has always been a matter of subjective opinion and you have every right to disagree. We don't mean to say the Palm Pre is failed by its looks but design sure had its ups and downs here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to talk about handling omitting the exciting ways to navigate and control the device. But the plastic finish, flimsy slider and the funny looks (bordering on stupid) do no justice to such an inspired and inventive piece of gear. We can't even make up our minds about the QWERTY keyboard. We guess it's reasonably good for the limited space it has to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Palm Pre loves to sit in the hand and is fun and exciting to navigate. There's nothing we can do about the build and finish but that won't change our mind about the webOS. We get busy showing it to you after the jump.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Palm Pre interface: webOS, Cards, gestures, multitasking and all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with, the Palm Pre does the one and only thing that iPhone can't (not without jailbreaking) - multitasking. The Pre is so much into it, the entire user interface is simply a giant task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called Cards Interface doesn't even involve a classic homescreen with shortcuts or widgets. The only thing you can do around these parts is change the wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there are five docked icons on a quick-launch taskbar - dialer, contacts, email, calendar and Launcher. The first four of them can be rearranged by tapping and dragging to the preferred location within the taskbar. The Launcher has its position fixed and is essentially the Palm Pre's main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar hides automatically when you open an app, but you can recall it any time by an upward finger sweep that starts at the gesture area and continues onto the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar emerges, sticking to your thumb and rippling and moving like a wave. It stays on screen as long as you don't lift your thumb and it's side-scrollable too - you can hit any of the shortcuts on it. The fancy wave-like animation is more of a show-off than anything else but it's nice to know a quick launcher is always at hand and you don't have to go all the way back to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's the very essence of the webOS and the Card Interface to begin with. Anything you've opened is available on the homescreen - like thumbs of running apps, or cards as Palm call it. Essentially, the screen is your workplace - the table to deal and shuffle the cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running apps are displayed as cards. They look and even behave like one. Every time you launch an app, it appears in full screen of course. Hitting the center key will collapse (zoom out) the fullscreen app, so it appears as a card (or thumb) on the screen. A tap on a blank screen space will zoom out even further, so you have an even smaller card. When many apps are running at once the small card view makes them easier to manage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter if you have the card view or fullscreen view, running apps can be switched between with finger sweeps - either across the screen or the gesture area. Simple and easy, just like you're switching homescreen panes. In Card view, taping on a card will expand the respective application fullscreen for you to work with. Alternatively, you can flick a card up and off the screen so it's removed from the lineup. In fact, it's the only way to end a task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can run as many apps as you want, but you'll eventually run out of RAM. We tried to run all the available stuff all at once. At one point we had a total of 28 cards and the Pre was going good. The next time we tried it we got a low memory warning at the 12th opened tab. So obviously the number of opened apps is not fixed - you can continue opening new ones as long as you have available RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a look further down</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this is what's happening onscreen but the Pre has a lot going on at the bottom too. The whole space around the Center key is touch-enabled. Palm calls it the Gesture area. We already told you how to drag the quick launcher on screen over an app that's running fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other navigation gestures include horizontal swipes across the whole Gesture Area: you can swipe left or right to browse the running apps - in Card or Fullscreen view regardless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short horizontal swipe left (starting at the Center key) will take you one step back no matter where you are in the interface. A series of these swipes will eventually take you to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe up doubles the Center key action - it will collapse a fullscreen application and show the card view. A second swipe up will start the main menu, which Palm call the launcher. Another way to do that is using the taskbar of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Launcher (main menu) is semi-transparent with colorful icons. The menu organization is pretty standard. You have three Launcher screens available - you scroll left or right to alternate them but they're vertically scrollable too. The first and second Launcher screens hold all your apps, while the third is dedicated to the phone settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page indicators are available at the bottom as you move through screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As any other handset - the status bar at the top of the screen on the Palm Pre displays the usual stuff - network name, digital clock and indicators for wireless and cellular coverage, along with the battery status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Status bar launches a semitransparent menu that can be used to manage Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Flight Mode, see the current date and battery levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally let's mention the event notifications. They are shown at the bottom of the screen just bellow the taskbar. Taping on a notification will reveal more additional information. For example if you have a new message a small bubble appears at the bottom and when you tap on it you will see who sent it. Alternatively, you can flick a notification to the side and off the screen when you're done with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synergy in action<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Managing contacts is easier than ever with Palm's Synergy. It supports multiple services (Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft Exchange, and Facebook) and you only have to enter your account and hit "sync" to start the automatic synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any changes to the contacts are synced automatically both ways. By the way, Palm's Synergy extends well beyond Contacts to Calendar, Emails, and Tasks (however, you can synchronize tasks only with Microsoft Exchange).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can add and edit contacts the old way - manually or using vCards received via email. If there are contacts appearing in multiple accounts they will be transferred to the phonebook as several entries. However, you can easily merge them under one entry (Palm call it linking). Of course, it's not actually merging the info from all services - it's just showing the various info under one common item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to browsing the contacts, there is something else worth mentioning. There is no onscreen alphabet scroll but you can jump to a certain letter using the hardware keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compose a text or MMS directly from a contact's detail page - using a dedicated icon which launches the message composer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management the simple way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any phone - that still holds true for smartphones no matter how smart they get. The Pre meets high standards of in-call voice quality and signal reception, but keeps it rather simple in terms of call management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a basic virtual dial pad with no smart dialing. During a call you can opt for speakerphone on, mute, display dial pad or add call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pre did quite well in our loudness test. It snatched a Very Good mark and here is how it stacks up against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging gets more fun by the day as you get used to the smallish keyboard and portrait orientation. As we've already pointed out, there is no on-screen keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notice that sending a message happens by just tapping on the button in the lower right corner of the screen. There is no confirmation required so once you've touched the button, the message gets sent (even if you tapped it by mistake).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something else you'll need some time to get used to is positioning the cursor. There is no magnifying glass as on the iPhone. Instead, you have the orange button on the hardware QWERTY keyboard to help you move the cursor without hiding the text with your finger - press and hold it to make a dot appearing right below the cursor, then move the dot wherever you want and the cursor will move along with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instant messaging is also supported (Google Talk and AIM only).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically. As far as the email editor is concerned, it's similar to the one responsible for SMS/MMS. You can also attach various types of files (including files that are unsupported by the device but are stored in its memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have multiple email accounts it can get complicated to get to the desired message. That is why you can mark several folders (inbox, outbox, drafts, etc.) as favorite and they will be displayed on top. By the way, that works even if you have one account only and is still very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting multiple messages (if you want to delete them) is impossible. On the other hand deleting a message is as easy as flicking it off the screen. And you're done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While reading emails you can take advantage of the multi-touch support and use the pinch-to-zoom gesture. You can also view attached documents (such as office documents, PDF files, images, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery with multi-touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Palm Pre sports a very nice, thumbable gallery. You can browse the images taken with the inbuilt camera or the ones stored in the phone's memory. Images are displayed as 4 x 3 thumb grids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While viewing a single picture you can zoom in or out by the pinch gesture (the volume rocker doesn't work here). And if you tap twice on the screen image is resized from fit-to-screen size to 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning is fine and the same goes for the accelerometer - changing the phone's orientation rotates the images instantaneously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Equalizer-less music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre features a standard for the class music player which sorts tracks by artist, album, and genre. You can also create playlists and album art is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you don't get is equalizer support. And we don't mean that there aren't any user customizable equalizers. There aren't any equalizers whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player interface is quite attractive and easy to navigate. Strangely, the player works in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can minimize the player and let it play in the background. The controls are hidden so to get to them just tap the icon in the lower right corner on the screen. And to get back to the player, use the card on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality, but for the stereo crosstalk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Competing head-to-head with some of the best sounding devices in business, the Palm Pre is allowed no slip-ups here. It is the first Palm we ever get to test for audio quality so it's quite interesting to see how the guys over at Sunnyvale did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pre didn't manage to top any charts for audio output but its performance was very good nonetheless. Noise levels and dynamic range are particularly impressive, probably the best we've seen on a mobile phone. Not that the subtle differences here will make any difference to a regular user but they are still an impressive achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is great with minimal-to-none deviations across the range. That little bend that you see in the graph is actually outside the audible range so it hardly makes any difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortion levels are also great. Even though they are a bit higher than the best we have seen it's unlikely to make a tangible difference to anyone but our testing gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk is the only aspect of the Palm Pre audio that we're not impressed with. At -53.9 dB it's among the worst we have seen on a mobile phone and mixing the two stereo channels will quite likely be audible at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the actual results so you check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Palm Pre vs Apple iPhone 3GS frequency response </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like everything else on the Pre, its video player has a simple interface. Videos are loaded in landscape mode and you can't change the screen orientation. You can only toggle ful-screen and original size view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to skip forward 30 sec you just need to sweep from left to across the screen. A swipe in the opposite direction will let you jump 10 sec back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no DivX/XviD video support so you'll either have to look for compatible videos only or you'd better get your PC a good video converter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel camera with flash and no autofocus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Palm Pre comes with a 3-megapixel fixed focus camera with LED flash and geo-tagging. There are no settings at all. You can't even change the image quality or resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your only chance of interaction is switching the flash on or to set it to auto mode. Kinda reminds the iPhone, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to the images themselves, the situation isn't much different. Color rendering and contrast are good. Noise levels are low, but that is achieved through heavy noise-reduction that smears away fine details and textures. The sharpening algorithm on the other hand is way too harsh and produces visible artifacts in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out a short shoot-out pitting Palm Pre, Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and Nokia E71 against each other. As you can see, none of them managed to impress with results. Nokia E71 turned out the best among those three while Pre's shots were the worst.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Palm Pre. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the resolution chart, the resolved detail is not as much as we hoped and the resolution doesn't seem enough for a 3 megapixel snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No video recording out of the box</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre can't record video out of the box. However, there is an application that enables video recording but it's still so early in development there isn't even a beta version. Well, it has a major flaw - there is no live viewfinder. The videos however are promising - the Precorder captures 480 x 320 pixel videos @ 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Precorder is an unofficial application so in order to get it you have to do some careful reading. This is a nice guide which will help you to get your Palm a video recorder and much more apps that aren't available in the App Catalog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video captured by the Pre.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: Bluetooth trimmed down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity the Palm Pre has it all - HSDPA, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. But here comes the cold shower: Bluetooth support is limited to headset use only (luckily, A2DP is supported) so forget about file transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news about file transfers is that you can access the 8GB worth of internal memory in mass storage over a USB cable - unlike the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pre has quad-band GSM support and tri-band 3G at 850, 1900 and 2100 MHz. You can check out our Worldwide GSM Network Bands distribution database for more info on those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 connections are supported as well (through a microUSB port). When connected to a computer, the Pre prompts you to select between Media Sync, USB Drive or Just Charge mode. You can use your Pre as an external storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm audio jack for the audiophiles is also onboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Palm Pre packs a nice WebKit based browser but without Flash support. There's no Flash video either but that's coming up sometime in 2010 with the Adobe Flash Player 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is extensively touch-optimized and supports multi-touch. On that nice capacitive screen and powerful hardware, the web browsing experience on the Pre is just great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages load quickly and look very good on the 3.1" screen, the pinch zoom is smooth and very fast with no visible lag. Scrolling up and down the page is also fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll see when starting the web browser are the bookmarks displayed as small web screenshots. In the field above them you can enter the address of a web site or enter a search query.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the currently missing Flash video support is concerned, there is a partial compensation for that - you get a preinstalled YouTube client, so watching streaming videos from the mobile YouTube version is trouble free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Let the Pre keep you organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Palm's first webOS based device offers several time-management features and all of them are easily accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers daily, weekly, and monthly views. And if Synergy lets sync easily your contacts from various accounts here you can have multiple calendars synced with the same services. It is possible to see the entries from all calendars together or separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new appointment is lightning fast: you just have to tap on the certain hour and start typing. The final touches (setting the reminder, etc.) are added by tapping on the "i" sign displayed after selecting the entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option to have it all planned and set is Memos or Tasks. Both apps have nice colorful interface and are easy to use. Memos are displayed on a cork board full of post-it notes. Note background can be easily changed and there are 4 color options. In the Tasks app you can create plenty of task lists and change their order as you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go to the Universal Search feature just start typing on the homescreen (no matter if there are any cards open) to find the application or contact you're looking for. The Universal Search goes even further and offers Google, Wikipedia, Google Maps, and Twitter to help you find what you're looking for. But don't go looking for calendar items or emails. They are not search-supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the simple calculator. All the on-screen buttons are large enough to guarantee problem free typing. The calculator works only in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing we're going to take a closer look at before we move on to the document viewer is the Clock. You can't get to it by tapping on the clock displayed on the homescreen. To reach it you have to go to the menu. You can set multiple alarms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A document viewer is readily available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren't too many things that come preloaded on the Pre but document viewers are at hand. It's worth the mention given the amount of time it took Android devices to finally have them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, there is no option to edit documents but the office and PDF viewer apps work fine and support multi-touch for zooming. Even if the CPU is quite zippy, you might have to wait for a moment or two at times for a file to be loaded. Afterwards everything works excellently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The App Catalog is far behind the competition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Palm Pre comes with only a few preloaded apps (there aren't any games among them, though) but luckily there is the App Catalog only a tap away. At least, this is what a person would think. The truth is the App Catalog has quite some to catch up with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the moment, there are approximately 800 applications in the App Catalog. Although their number grows by the day that hardly compares to the variety offered by competitors (Apple and Android mainly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we didn't have access to the App Catalog for some reason. Some sources state that the reason is Palm have made the App Catalog available only in countries where the Pre is sold officially.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope this isn't true. There must be enough SIM-free Palm Pre owners living outside Germany (or the UK, Ireland and Spain) who have spent plenty of money on their devices. And limited access to the store also means limited phone functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, when it comes to the App Catalog itself, its structure is reminiscent of the competition. You can easily find what you are looking for. Well, if it is available at the store in the first place. And if it isn't, you may want to try some unofficial applications (like the Precorder).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lonely GPS receiver<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Palm Pre comes with a built-in GPS receiver however the only mapping software that makes use of it is Google Maps. You know how it works and what it can do. Long story short: actual navigation is a no go and if you still want to give it a try, you'd better have a data plan since it needs constant access to the Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan your trips with Google Maps. And as you know, there are even turn by turn directions but no voice guidance. Unfortunately, Pre's Google Maps version doesn't offer the Street View feature that we happen to like very much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Sprint's CDMA version of Palm Pre packs a great piece of software with voice guided turn-by-turn navigation and all the other goodies. We really hope the Palm Pre GSM gets the same treatment soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From a user's point of view, Palm were only a step away from going bust, when they announced the Palm Pre and its webOS almost a whole year ago. From the very start, it was shaping as one of the most eagerly anticipated and novel gadgets of 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the smartphone didn't get that big in our part of the world - probably due to the late launch of the GSM version worldwide. But it may be enough to jumpstart Palm's business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Palm Pre sounds like a recipe for success but obviously something went wrong. It's got a great potential - a brilliant capacitive touchscreen (which could have been a tad bigger actually), zippy hardware platform, various connectivity options, integrated GPS receiver and much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But unfortunately there are a lot of things about the Pre that seem quite premature even though they've had almost a year now to work on its software updates. The WebOS UI is quite a looker and it's well planned and executed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we run into "blank spots" wherever we hit. For instance, the Pre has no file manager so your only option to delete files is via a computer cable connection. The Pre has got stereo Bluetooth support - but no wireless file transfers? The Pre has a nice physical keyboard, but what about a virtual on-screen one? We can go on listing, but we've made our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is more, they've had over a year to optimize the OS code, but the Palm Pre still feels slower than the iPhone 3GS even though both use the same hardware. Truth be told, its performance matches that of the older iPhone 3G instead of its successor's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Palm Pre, with its colorful and innovative user interface feels like a breath of fresh air to us tech journalists. It brings lots of new ideas and we really hope Palm will have the chance to improve them in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPhone 3GS ? Apple iPhone 3G </paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you think we're being too harsh on the Pre and its unfinished business, turn back the clock just a few weeks to our Nokia N900 review. It felt even rawer than the Pre. But both have huge potential and our only regret is Palm just didn't make good enough use of a whole year since the Pre's launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, if you don't fancy the idea of becoming a Maemo 5 early tester, you can also go for a device like the Nokia N97 or the N97 mini which run a touch optimized version of the Symbian S60 platform. But, yes, their OS feels inferior to webOS in terms of user friendliness and feel.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Speaking of new software platforms, there is one more that we can think of: Google's Android OS. And if the Pre was Palm's survival plan, Milestone (DROID) was Motorola's. It runs the latest reincarnation of the Android OS and has an impressive feature pack. There is hardly anything missing. If you feel like going for Android, you can also take a look at the now elderly HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) or the newer HTC Hero. The Hero lacks a hardware keyboard, but we'd skip it anyway.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another well-equipped device without hardware keyboard is the BlackBerry Storm2 9520, which has an improved touchscreen after all the issues that used to plague the predecessor. The next level of the Storm evolution packs a large capacitive touchscreen, HSDPA, Wi-Fi, and GPS plus the typical BlackBerry messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Storm2 9520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is clear Palm didn't see much point in inching their way out of oblivion. They needed to come back with a bang. And they did. The Pre did its job and the sooner they move on, the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever negatives we might have said about the phone can't change the fact that we like it. It's a strange looking thingy with a rather vague concept of build quality. But it got propelled to the top by its creative webOS. Not bad for a late comeback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess it's now time for the next webOS phone and we don't mean the Pixi. Mainstream would be too much to ask from Palm, but a device capable of a much wider appeal seems the only thing to do their OS justice.</paragraph>
