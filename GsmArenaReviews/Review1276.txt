			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new generation of 1GHz Symbian- powered phones can get far. They need a place to start though and the Nokia 500 is happy to help. The common belief seems to be that there are more exciting things than Symbian on a budget. OK, well, the Nokia 500 is supposed to make you reconsider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the sound of a 1GHz processor, this phone doesn?t mind starting small. The Nokia 500 is hitting the shelves with Anna inside and the upcoming Belle gives it extra value. By the way, the Nokia 500 seems to make enough sense even without the most recent software. The Finns have more than a handful of basic smartphones whose owners will be delighted at the news of a next smartphone for the masses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia didn?t skimp on hardware to give the 500 a bump in processor and data speed. The excellent connectivity package is hard to beat in the low end with goodies like free SatNav and penta-band HSPA coverage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, they needed to match the power hike with cuts in other departments. It?s always a matter of balance in the low end after all. The all-plastic finish and garden variety TFT display are things we can live with and we think the exchangeable covers will help the target audience agree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low-end imaging and media are things to warn against but we guess a long list of limitations is hardly surprising for a basic smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, no point wasting time on lengthy introductions. This isn?t the first time we meet the Nokia 500. We know what to expect but focus this time will be on the actual performance. Can?t do without our traditional hardware inspection though, coming up after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia 500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 omits a memory card in the box. It's a basic package, which only has the essentials: a compact charger, a microUSB cable and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 is a reasonably compact phone at 111.3 x 53.8 x 14.4 mm, as long as the Nokia 700 isn't around. We're talking the same screen size and pretty much the same height and width - but the Nokia 500 is quite a lot chubbier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rich assortment of colorful back covers gives the Nokia 500 enough youth appeal but other than that, it's actually a conservatively designed phone. It's a touchscreen-bar device of simple styling and low-cost finish, nothing extravagant about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved rear makes it comfortable to hold and the soft rubbery finish is pleasant to touch though probably not very durable. Unfortunately the screen glass and the black glossy frame get covered in fingerprints in no time. The Nokia 500 requires regular cleaning if you want to keep it looking good. The soft rubbery finish of the back cover isn't particularly strong - it appears we managed to scratch it by simply pocketing it or putting it on tables.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is dominated by the 3.2" nHD (360x640) capacitive touchscreen. The resolution fits the screen size nicely and the display looks good with pleasingly vibrant colors and enough detail. It's just not as crisp and punchy as a ClearBlack screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, outdoor performance is average, bordering on poor. With brightness set at maximum it will do on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display you'll find the two call buttons, the Menu key in between. Just above them, in the display bezel, is the Nokia 500 microphone. The earpiece is above the display where you also have an ambient light detector and a proximity sensor to disable the display during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone features the Lock button, which replaces the lock slider usually found on Symbian handsets. The thin, but tactile, volume rocker is above it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing to note on left side of the Nokia 500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is where the connectivity ports are. The MicroUSB port is enabled for both charging and data connections. There's a standard Nokia 2mm charging port, as well as a 3.5mm audio jack. All ports are unprotected so they are prone to dust, but have nothing to get in the way when you are actually using them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the device only holds the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Nokia 500 unit is all black but it came with an extra couple of rear covers, in red and blue. The back cover wraps around the phone's bottom to create a nice color accent. Unlike the standard black cover, those two weren't so prone to smudges. The phone does look fresher too, with a bit of color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back you see the 5 MP camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. There's no flash on the Nokia 500 and no camera key either - a virtual shutter is all there is. A Nokia logo is nicely etched out in the soft rubbery surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 1110 mAh Li-Ion battery powers the handset, with both the SIM compartment and microSD card slot under it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 is quoted at up to 500h of 2G standby and 455h in 3G. Talk times are 7h and 5h respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 feels comfortable in the hand and isn't a hassle to carry around. It's a simple design free of embellishments and we don't mind the plastic finish. Exchangeable back covers are the only design feature to note.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hanging with Anna, waiting for Belle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 is said to be getting Symbian Belle, though that should only happen at the end of the year. Symbian Anna it is for the time being - and you would've thought it made perfect sense in an entry level smartphone. That's what we thought at least. But we were left wondering if Symbian Belle could do anything to make things better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is, the Nokia 500 didn't behave too well. We experienced lags all too often, even in something as simple as scrolling the homescreen panes. Nothing major but we were less than impressed - and we thought that's what a 1GHz phone should do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Anna edition does introduce a few changes that make Symbian better than its predecessors. Nokia finally fixed text input (though they didn?t do a perfect job of it), the browser is updated and so are other core Symbian apps. But there are still some issues left to Belle and its successors to address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get into detail, check out this video for a bit of Symbian Anna in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian Anna homescreen consists of three panes. You are free to fill it up with widgets and reshuffle them as you see fit. You can delete the ones you don?t need but you still can't have more than three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrolling of homescreen panes is looped so you never need to go back from the last one. Auto-rotation of the homescreen is enabled too. In fact, Nokia take auto-rotation so seriously that even the dialer rotates in landscape. Not that it makes any sense - it doesn't turn into a QWERTYkeyboard or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna brings with it a new style for the icons in the main menu - they are now very rounded squares. It's an aesthetic change mostly, as they are just as easy to hit with your thumb as the old ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is unchanged, retaining the hierarchical folder structure. This dates back from much earlier Symbian versions and we were hoping that it would change - to get to your apps, you have to hit the menu key and go into Applications. Modern day smartphones have dozens of apps installed, so easier access to them would have been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are free to rearrange icons as you see fit so you might go for placing them all in the main folder and get a flat-ish menu system, but you have to do that manually, there's no bulk move option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create custom folders too, which can help you organize your apps. All custom folders look the same however, giving no clue of what's inside. A list view mode is also available but that involves much more scrolling and that?s why we preferred to leave things in grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager is identical to the Symbian^3 implementation - it shows screenshots of the running apps, up to three at a time (regardless of screen orientation). You can swipe sideways to browse the apps and you can terminate them with a single click too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature is the popup available by tapping the top right corner of the screen. It gives you a bigger clock, a shortcut to the connectivity menu, a battery button (charge in % and a shortcut to power saving mode) plus notifications - e.g. missed calls, new messages and others. It just shows the number of events, it won't show you the beginning of a new text message like Android's notification area will. This pop-up menu is available throughout the phone interface and you can also toggle Wi-Fi and USB settings from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One positive change is that there's always a Back virtual key visible, which makes navigating apps simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Options menu still relies on the menu/submenu structure, which is a relic of the non-touch days of Symbian and is begging for an Android-like solution (menu key that shows a panel with 6-8 buttons for the most common options, maybe a More button if you really want to dig into the settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise the Nokia 500 should be better than the previous Symbian^3 and Anna models - now that it's got a 1GHz CPU. But although we can?t quite put a finger on what's wrong, the performance is not up to scratch. The phone is just slow to react and after a while you might find yourself annoyed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A Symbian phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 comes with a fully functional phonebook, which can easily be synced with your exchange account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time and now the Anna also improves the SNS integration to bring it more up to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the displayed list. This saves you quite a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact?s details is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. You can see the latest status update right from the contact info - or at least the first two lines of it. Tap on it to read the full message or send a reply. That takes a few seconds though as the Social app needs to load first.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony offers turn-to-mute<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any call-related issues with the Nokia 500. Reception is solid, voice quality good on both ends of a call. The earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available on the 500 and gets activated by pressing and holding the call key on the home screen. It is fully speaker-independent and as far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer. Bear in mind too, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the system will dial either the default number or the first in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also here - you just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call. Searching by portions of the contact's phone number doesn?t work though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 500 has the usual accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down is present. That same turn-to-mute trick also works for snoozing your alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically when you hold the phone next to your cheek during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 lacks active noise cancellation, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has conversations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 can easily cater for all your messaging needs. All your incoming messages arrive in a common inbox. If you like, you can also get them sorted as conversations, in threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 relies on a shared editor for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Insert some multimedia content the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 email client allowed us to setup our Gmail account quite easily, including syncing the account as an Exchange Active Sync one so that we'd get all our contacts. Usually, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go in no time. The Active Sync setup required a few manual settings though and we believe Nokia should do something about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia 500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be filtered by various criteria such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, searching is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need on a mobile device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Proper portrait QWERTY at long last<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Anna, the Symbian portrait QWERTY keyboard has split screen support, meaning the top half of the screen is left for the app, while the bottom part is for the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the portrait QWERTY are a bit small, despite the available screen estate. Still, you can activate word prediction, which will guess the word you're trying to type and show a small popup with the word you actually typed, in case you're trying to enter something like a user name (which doesn?t have to be a valid word, in fact word prediction in this case gets in the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This eliminates the annoying situation of taking you out of the app and into a text edit screen and then back to the app (entering URLs in the browser and using the URL autocomplete was the most painful example). Also, you don?t have to change orientations just to use the QWERTY keyboard, which was mightily annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's not perfect - several apps would popup the old text edit screen, obscuring the app even though we were using the portrait QWERTY. The Ovi store app is an example of where that happens, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery app in Nokia 500 is quite the looker. It's the updated gallery from Symbian^3 PR1.2, so it's not exactly new but we're still glad to see the change. Photos are displayed in a grid (3 columns) and you can scroll up and down (with kinetic scrolling no less).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you?ve zoomed on an image, kinetic scrolling is still there but it's hard to trigger some times and that?s sure to cost the 500 a few points. On the positive side, opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the familiar pinch gesture you can also zoom in by double taping, the volume rocker or even the on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available straight in the gallery. The Send option offers only MMS, email or Bluetooth with no image sharing service integration. The Share key takes you to the Social app where you can choose between Facebook and Twitter social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features of the image gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall picture browsing and zooming is relatively fast, so we had no complaints of the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A familiar music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian never had trouble with the music player features but its looks were far from impressive. With Symbian^3 however Nokia introduced a new Cover Flow-like interface, which adds the much needed eye-candy. They haven't changed anything since.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight on the phone. With the huge number of supported formats, equalizer presets and effects the feature set is complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case you can control it through the music player widget on the homescreen, which also displays the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has lots of limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 video player looks quite capable on paper but the actual performance was a letdown. The player supports DivX, XviD and MP4, but cannot play larger files properly (if at all), nor is it capable of 720p playback. WVGA clips are the limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player app itself only works in full-screen landscape mode. A tap on the screen shows the controls, which are otherwise hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is incapable of playing 720p videos or files bigger than 1.5GB or so. But that's hardly a problem, since even 300MB Xvid files turned out to be really hard to handle for the Nokia 500 - dropped frames, choppy videos and lagging sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Videos section includes several extra apps. One is an editor that lets you create videos and video slideshows. The others are YouTube, CNN Video, E!, National Geographic, and a Paramount Movie Teasers application. They require an internet connection and not all content is free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 500 has the same neat and simple interface like on its Symbian^1 and ^3 predecessors. You can search skip preset and new stations alike with sweep gestures or you can use the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 500 has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel, the 500 should hopefully be able to auto-tune to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is the best part of 500 radio app. The radio station name gets displayed with cool effects across the whole screen, while the rest of the readings are printed in nicely legible font at the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 didn't disappoint in our audio quality test. As a matter of fact it manage to bring a nice surprise by performing better than the Nokia 701.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no reistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia 500 achieved great scores all over the field and it was slightly louder than its more expensive sibling. You probably won't be able to detect the difference with a naked ear, but it's still a nice achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, the Nokia 500 experiences very little degradation when you do plug a pair of haeadphones. Stereo crosstalk increases less than we are used to, while intermodulation distortion jumps, but still remains at a good level. That's certainly a performance better than the price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 5 megapixel fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. Unfortunately the lack of autofocus continues an unfortunate trend from most other Symbian smartphones we?ve seen recently. There is no LED flash either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only a couple of shortcuts available in the viewfinder plus a slider for the digital zoom. The shortcuts allow you to allow you to toggle camcorder and still camera and access the rest of the customizable settings (at the mid-bottom).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred a few more shortcuts to be available right on the viewfinder. Also, changing a setting harkens back to the days of tap to select, tap again to activate, which should have been long forgotten by now. For example, it takes you four taps to change the ISO - the first to open the settings menu, one to go into the ISO menu, one to select an ISO setting and one to activate it. Can you pick which step is one too many?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the functionality is mostly there. On the Nokia 500 you?re in charge of white balance, color tone, exposure, ISO, contrast and sharpness. You can also go for one of the preset scene modes and there is an option for creating a custom scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection is also available on the Nokia 500. As for geotagging, it lets you record your current location in the EXIF information of the photos, using the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos look great on the phone's nHD screen and this is the most important thing for the majority of users. When stretched on a larger screen, however, the Nokia 500 images aren't so impressive. The colors are decent, contrast is very good and there's a reasonable amount of detail, but noise levels are way too high and there are lots of artifacts, caused by the aggressive processing algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also the major missing feature ? autofocus ? becomes apparent when you try taking a close-up. Anything closer than 50cm is a no-go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. It actually did quite decently here as the side-effects of its image processing are less pronounced on the black-and-white charts than they are in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 500 in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor VGA camcorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 shoots in VGA resolution at 15 fps - nothing to be excited about. The video quality is also disappointing - the lack of detail, the high compression and the low frame rate result in highly disappointing videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample from the Nokia 500 ? VGA@15fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 is a true globe trotter. All kinds of network connectivity options are at your disposal - quad-band GPRS and EDGE along with penta-band 3G with HSPA. You can go pretty much anywhere in the world where there's GSM or UMTS signal and connect. The 3G is pretty fast too with 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB is version 2.0, with the standard microUSB port capable of charging the phones besides transferring data. There is no USB on-the-go support though. The phone is capable of charging via a standard microUSB charger, but not via a microUSB cable connected to a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth connectivity is versio0n 2.1 with stereo support and there's a Wi-Fi b/g radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot can be used for transferring data to and from your 500. Unfortunately the card slot is under the battery, so it's not hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio port completes the connectivity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser: better features, poor handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser has been a sore weak spot in touch-enabled Symbians but Symbian Anna fixes a lot of the issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 browser has good page rendering and offers some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager. Panning is relatively smooth but zooming can be a little slow at times, taking a second to redraw the page content after you zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the nagging issues in the browser were fixed too - you can now open a new tab easily (why it took Nokia this long to implement this we'll never know) and it takes you only one tap to get to the popup menu with the most useful browser options (it used to take two taps, which is one too many).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the popup menu's shortcut on the right of the screen, there's also an always-visible back button on the left. They are quite small and don't cover much of the screen. It used to be that you needed two taps to go back a page too - once to make the back button visible and once to press it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back still uses the 3D stack of page thumbnails to let you choose how many steps back you want to go (it's an option that you can turn off if you prefer to go back one step directly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we're really pleased to see is how the QWERTY keyboard integrates with the browser. You can use the portrait QWERTY to start entering an URL and the list suggested sites pops up immediately. The previous screen required going back and forth between screens, which was pretty much unusable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a chunk of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the text doesn't auto fit to the smaller viewport and you still need to scroll sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Flash Lite 4.0 support, 360p YouTube videos played in the browser but with both video and sound quite choppy. Flash games wouldn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may as well choose to switch Flash off to cut down on loading times and save some data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing on Nokia 500 was a disappointing experience. It's slow and laggy, whether zooming, panning or scrolling. Despite the Anna optimizations, this didn't feel at all like a 1GHz device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer omits a document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian has traditions in the Organizer department and the Nokia 500 with Symbian Anna is no exception. Nokia has just tweaked a thing or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves from the Ovi store for free. There is a ZIP manager too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 comes with social networking integration, part of which we saw in the phonebook. The Social app however is the nexus for all things social - it supports the two most popular networks, Facebook and Twitter. You can have multiple accounts on each network but only one of each can be active at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section offers extensive options with an easy to use, touch-optimized user interface. Posting a status update is simple as is attaching a photo or video (or shooting new ones on the spot) as well as adding geo-tagging information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is accessed through a similarly easy interface. There's a handy button to shorten links and you can attach photos and videos to your tweets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input field for status updates for both Facebook and Twitter covers only the top half of the screen and the portrait QWERTY fits snugly on the bottom half of the screen, which is pretty clever positioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is the All Activity section that becomes available when you add both Facebook and Twitter accounts. It pools status updates from both networks into a single list. You can also post a status update on both networks simultaneously from here. Unfortunately, there's no option to post only to one of the networks - you have to go to the networks specific section to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend search also becomes available on both networks - it searches both accounts for a given name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store provides you with apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still one of the most popular smartphone OSes in the world but its application store is pretty barren compared to the two juggernauts, the iOS App Store and Android's Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has refreshed their Ovi store interface to make it more user-friendly for Symbian^3 and it's what you get on Anna too. And while the UI is indeed very handy to use, the number of apps is somewhat of a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default screen shows a list of featured apps or you can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? Summer Gift of Games, Chat Collection, Apps Start Kit, Travel, Tools for Professionals and Apps for Kids are the collections available at the time of this writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps record of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Free lifetime navigation with Ovi Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 500 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a satellite lock from a cold start (A-GPS turned off) in about two minutes. Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the 500 even in a dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know since the start of last year Nokia made their Ovi Maps navigation free for all their smartphones, which naturally includes the 500. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Ovi Maps application itself, blessing it with a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as the Lonely planet city guide, HRS hotels and the Michelin restaurant guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also 5-day weather information for cities available along with Map Reporter, which can be used to report inaccuracies you find on the map. You can choose which of those are visible in the menu, which helps avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Ovi Maps 3.06 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps. Starting with v3.06 can download maps directly from the phone, no computer needed anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map. Ovi Maps 3.06 also joins in on the location check-in craze and supports a long list of networks (but not Foursquare, understandably).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 500 left us with mixed feelings. The spotty web browser and the poor camera performance left a bitter taste and we found it hard to describe the UI as fluid or responsive. In fact, more often than not it was downright laggy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve seen this new 1GHz hardware platform do much better elsewhere so we are willing to blame it all on the non-optimized software that was rushed to the market. Of course that?s where we got our review unit ? right off the store shelves. And we have to say, it performed worse than the pre-market sample we previewed earlier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the free lifetime turn-by-turn navigation and the brightly colored exchangeable rear covers didn?t make up for the poor impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s more - the asking price of Nokia 500 doesn?t seem all that reasonable either. Currently, the Nokia 500 can be found for about 170-200 euros, the kind of money that will buy an Android smartphone like the latest Sony Ericsson Xperia mini and we are not even talking the X10 flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting the droids aside, Nokia's own C6-01 already runs Symbian Anna (and it?s prepping itself for a Belle upgrade). The C6-01 costs the same as the Nokia 500. It is based on a less capable hardware, but strangely, offers far better performance and comes with an AMOLED ClearBlack display with Gorilla glass. It offers goodies such as USB on-the-go and an 8 megapixel camera with a 720p camcorder. And it does have HD video playback,unlike the Nokia 500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, something went really wrong with the Nokia 500. It could be the software being a rather rushed job or it was done on purpose so they could keep it down in its market niche. Still, we?re willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope things will only get better for the Nokia 500 ? both performance-wise and price-wise by the time the Belle update is released.</paragraph>
