			<paragraph>The Touch HD is storming the WinMo stage to leave a footprint the size of half the HTC portfolio. Not so long ago we saw Windows Mobile changing for the better thanks to the TouchFLO 3D, The latest flagship gets things even hotter with a multimedia twist. And the new screen? well, beauty's in the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks like all that stands between the Touch HD and legend is the actual performance. A bold statement it is, so what we're about to do is push it to its limits. An unforgiving spec sheet calls for unforgiving scrutiny. Join us as we set sail to explore the HTC Touch HD big sway and little secrets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch HD is simply the next big thing in the Windows Mobile realm. And big is by no means limited to size. Indeed, the handset does come out a little too hefty but the feature pack is the kind to make you forget about size. The massive screen and so-unlike-WinMo multimedia skills give HTC Touch HD the kind of crossover appeal to reach beyond the hardcore PocketPC following.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main market competitor is probably the Samsung i900 Omnia. Now, technically, it should be the Omnia upgrade competing against the HD, but there we are for the want of any. While the Omnia has a smaller screen with merely a quarter of the pixels, it certainly comes closest to the Touch HD among all WinMo devices. In addition, it is a bit smaller, has some massive embedded memory and goes at a lower price, having been around for quite a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the HTC very own - the Touch Diamond will probably seem more appealing to those who find the HD too big for a nice ride. The Diamond lacks the 5MP shooter but it ain't much of a loss from our point of view. And if QWERTY is higher on your list than screen estate - the HTC Touch Pro is a must consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having mentioned Touch Pro, the archenemy Xperia X1 inevitably leaps to mind. However we're not quite sure whether we can call the Xperia a direct competitor of the Touch HD. It's not only the smaller screen and full QWERTY. It's just that the Touch Pro seems better suited to keep Sony Ericsson X1 busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we seem to finally be getting to the point. The resemblance between HTC Touch HD and the Apple iPhone 3G is just too strong to overlook. While the user experience of the iPhone is still well ahead of anything WinMo gadgets can offer, the Touch HD is as close as we've seen one get. It's got quite a larger screen than iPhone 3G, which takes fingertip navigation to a whole new level (in Windows Mobile terms that is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 3G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the alternatives behind our back, we can now give the HTC Touch HD the attention it deserves. Follow us to the next page for the unboxing ritual.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remember the Touch Diamond truncated pyramid-shaped box? Well, the HTC Touch HD retail box goes a completely different way - made of cardboard, the rectangular box is as simple as it gets. When you lift the cover you will see the phone waiting for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid section of the box beneath contains all the stuff - a nice looking wired headset (like the Diamond's), standard USB cable, a two-piece charger, which uses the USB cable itself to connect the handset to the plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extras are a spare stylus, an 8 GB microSD card and a carrying case made of polar-fleece-like fabric. At the bottom is the rest of the box contents - a screen protector on top, two discs, quick user guide and a bunch of brochures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch HD 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD stands at 115 x 62.8 x 12 mm and weighs 146 grams. It's a nicely slim device but of robust width and weight. The gorgeous 3.8" display is the best payback though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Full touch operation doesn't leave too much room for design creativity and the iPhone styling is pretty much the standard. That said, the Touch HD somehow comes out bulkier than Apple's handset, which is more notable in reality than the numerical difference in size suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD still has a very pleasant design with rounded corners and polished looks. Edges on both the front and the rear are sloping, which makes the phone very ergonomic and pleasant to hold. The back panel has a soft rubbery finish for a secure non-slip grip and is immune to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front in contrast, which is almost entirely taken by the quality display, leaves an ample space for fingerprint smudges. The 3.8" display just needs to be scratch-resistant, though there is no word of this on the HTC site. The unpleasant memories of the Diamond still hold - its display was said to be scratch-proof but even the stylus used to inflict scratches, not to mention the usual phone handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been hearing many reports that the black gloss paint surrounding the display is prone to chipping and flaking after short periods of use. After we had our Touch Diamond plastic key surface flaking in only three months time, we don't find the HD complaints too hard to believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the HTC Touch is absolutely fabulous. Better yet, compared to other WinMo devices, touch operation is utterly smooth - the lightest touch will do, with sensitivity seemingly as good as with the Diamond. Of course the graphical elements on the Touch HD are scaled so they occupy more physical space and in result single-handed thumb operation is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only a handful of controls on the body. Four touch-sensitive keys are placed below the display (two receiver keys, Home key and Back key). Each press on them has vibration feedback and using them is surprisingly in coherence with touchscreen display. The disparity between touch-sensitive and analogue controls on one single phone is now gone providing for an excellent user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no D-pad here - or even a touch-sensitive scroll wheel. While the iPhone can get away with that, we have our doubts about Windows Mobile usability without a directional navigation solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, the HTC logo and the secondary video-call camera are flanking the earpiece grill, which accommodates the proximity sensor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone hosts the USB port, the microphone pinhole and a stylus compartment in the lower right corner. Much like on the Touch Diamond, the stylus is active and magnetic action helps keeping it in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top are the slim power key and the standard 3.5 mm audio jack. The jack nest sticks out a bit to create a palpable bulge at the top. Now probably the first thing you'll notice about the power key is that it's really hard to press it as it doesn't protrude at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left side of the body and that pretty much sums up the available controls on the Touch HD, as the right side is pretty bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the HTC Touch HD is the 5 megapixel camera lens, nestled within a bulging brushed metal plate. Somewhat hard to notice, the tiny loudspeaker grill is discreetly bordering on the left side of the brushed metal plate. There is no LED flash, but that's not a big waste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it, the more serious issue is the lack of a dedicated camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The implementation of the touch operated shutter in HTC Touch HD strongly reminds us of the much criticized iPhone camera, where the lack of a hardware shutter key made third-party developers work hard to reassign the function to some of the other hardware keys - such as the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover doesn't really reveal much of the handset except the fact that HTC have put the reset pinhole there hidden away from easy access. You don't have to remove the battery to access it but still it doesn't seem the best solution from a usability point of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also under the rear cover but luckily, it's accessible without removing the battery itself. So as it seems, future Touch HD users will have a fair deal of rear panel handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Li-Ion battery with capacity of 1350 mAh ensures about 2 day of intensive usage of the Touch HD, which is a decent achievement having in mind the 3.8" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With almost the same dimensions as Apple iPhone 3G, the Touch HD feels and handles well but singlehanded operation is not as comfortable as the iPhone icon homescreen layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What should be noted though is that for the first time on a WinMo device the stylus is almost entirely redundant - the massive Touch HD screen and enlarged UI graphics allow for a hassle-free thumb scrolling and selection across menus and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft rubbery texture at the rear provides a pleasant and secure grip and the weight of the handset is hardly a burden. A styling that's obviously more conservative than iPhone is surely to be appreciated by many users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Touch only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD has a dedicated touch-sensitive Home key below the display to comfortably take you to the TouchFLO Home tab no matter what. Another extra handy control is the Back key. Now, WinMo devices usually pass on Back keys, so we do like seeing them on all recent HTC phones. The control never fails to get you back to the previous screen regardless of what application you are using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the touch sensitive scroll wheel we cheered in the Touch Diamond is not available in the Touch HD. We get the logic perfectly right and acknowledge the fact that fitting it below the large display it would have turned the device into a real monster. So, there we go, more screen means less knobs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic screen rotation thanks to the built-in accelerometer is a nice addon to Windows Mobile devices. Screen rotation has been implemented in these handsets ever since Windows Mobile 5 surfaced several years ago, but doing it automatically had obviously never occurred to engineers. And once again - it's the iPhone that changed the industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, there were some handsets with built-in accelerometers even before the iPhone, however their built-in sensors were not used for auto rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, much like the HTC Touch Diamond the auto screen rotation feature on the HTC Touch HD works only in selected applications such as Photos and Videos and the web browser, and you can't turn the feature off. Unless you use a third party tweak, that is, and there are already some capable applications to serve that purpose. More on that in the dedicated Tweaks&amp;Modding section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchFLO UI - WinMo on new heights<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unless you have been living in a cave for the past two years or you are a Windows Mobile hater, you are probably familiar with the TouchFLO UI. It has been on every HTC device since the HTC Touch but it's the most recent implementation that really made the break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the HTC Touch it was a launcher application in the form of a cool looking 3D cube, controlled via finger sweeps. To that the HTC Touch Cruise added finger scrolling in applications such as Contacts, Messaging, Internet Explorer Mobile. Users also enjoyed some fancy image flipping and zooming in the custom image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next step was HTC Touch Diamond which took all that another level up introducing the TouchFLO 3D. It does offer the same thumb-optimized features as the HTC Touch Cruise, but adds the extra cool TouchFLO homescreen that just begs you to finger flip it to the right and left. It's fluid, it's all eye candy, and you've already probably seen enough of it online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the HTC Touch HD uses the very same UI as the HTC Touch Diamond but the higher resolution screen provides space for a few extra thingies. Some of the tabs on the home screen have been redone for extra convenience and a few nice rearrangements were made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just so you know, for this review we are running our Touch HD on the latest ROM version that's commercially available. We haven't applied any system tweaks to it. Still the TouchFLO 3D UI is in its most responsive shape and once you learn to control it properly it's a real pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some minor lags and holdups, but this is Windows Mobile we are talking about and without them we would've been guessing something was seriously wrong with our device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchFLO 3D homescreen - the heart of HTC Touch HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D Home screen offers a choice of full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the tab thumbnails at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list is long and includes the home screen (with a large clock and a calendar), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, photos and video, music, weather, settings and a customizable application launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's have a closer look at those tabs. A nice thing is that each tab comes with its own set of context keys, but the downside is that those are not customizable. With the TouchFLO 3D at hand, you would rarely have to resort to using the Windows built-in interface (except for file browsing and setting the alarm). And considering the design and functionality of that underlying interface this is enough of a reason to cheer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than showing the clock, the Home tab gives you access to the HTC Call log, Windows World clock, Windows Alarm application, Windows calendar application - in case you have pending events for the day, they too get listed here. The context keys give you access to the dialing screen and the TouchFLO Programs tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the second TouchFLO tab called People, you can set favorite contacts, which would be displayed with their assigned images or, in case you haven't set those, a generic image. You can scroll images with a finger sweep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the photo will give you the contact's details, while a tap on the number below the image will automatically dial it. You can scroll the favorite contacts by using the thumbnail bar on the right too. The context keys give you access to the regular Windows Mobile contact list or several settings for managing favorite contacts, such as remove or change picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab shows your latest SMS/MMS. A single finger sweep displays the next message. A small shortcut in the top right corner will automatically start a new SMS/MMS with the default Windows message editor. The right context key will give you access to the Windows Mobile SMS/MMS inbox, while the left brings out a quick shortcut menu which allows you to create, forward, reply to or delete an SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email tab displays your emails in an attractive way and, again, you can flip through them one by one. The number of unread emails appears on the right. A dedicated shortcut starts a the email editor. The context keys give you access to the Windows Mobile Email inbox, as well as several commands such as Send/Receive or Email Account management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper half of the Internet tab launches the Opera 9.5 web browser or the slick preinstalled YouTube video client. You can also scroll your bookmarks and load one directly from there. The first context key displays all of your bookmarks but this time within the browser, while the second one? starts the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC must have lost their focus setting up this tab. A shortcut to the preinstalled RSS reader and streaming media player would have been much handier. There's no option either for changing the default Opera browser and there's no way to type a URL directly on the Home screen and open it in the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we are really wondering is how come HTC haven't fixed that yet, as the tab was crippled the exact same way back on the HTC Touch Diamond a few months ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes the Stock tab, which gives you quotes for companies of your choice (Apple iPhone anyone). This tab is debuting on HTC HD, as it wasn't available on either the Diamond or the Touch Pro. The soft keys allow you to update quotes with a single press or take you to the list of all your selected companies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos and Videos tab quite obviously gives you access to your images and video files. You can scroll them with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since there isn't a hardware camera key of any kind, this turns out to be pretty much the easiest way to start it. The context keys give you access to the Album application, which is used for viewing all your images and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab displays albums with their covers and you can flip through them much like you would on the iPhone and its gorgeous Cover Flow. The context keys let you access the music player options and the music player library where you can sort your music based on other filters beside album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab is again self explanatory but it easily amazes with graphics. You can check the weather in several locations and you can alternate them with a finger sweep. The HTC Touch HD now offers a 5-day forecast for the selected location. The soft keys are used for managing the locations, for which the weather will be monitored and for updating them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Settings and it lets you control various system options saving you the effort of using the confusing Windows Mobile Settings page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, you can set the ringing profile, volume level and ringtone all from one central place. Now, that's really handy. Even pressing the volume rocker brings up a fancy custom-made fullscreen slider instead the usual WinMo mini sliders. The original Windows Mobile sound settings are accessible from here too and are listed under Advanced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have access to the HTC custom Communications manager, which handles all on-board transceivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have even created the so-called System status screen, which gets invoked when you touch the icons on the top of the Homescreen. Those status icons are too tiny to press accurately with a finger and normally you would need the stylus to check the battery status (by touching the battery indicator), regulate volume (by touching the speaker icon), or open the communications manager or phone and connectivity settings (by touching the signal indicator or network icon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the System status screen, once you touch the area of those icons with your big finger, all of them get listed fullscreen so you can easily pick the one you want. It's an extra step but one that cannot be anymore worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the last tab is the customizable Application launcher where you can set shortcuts to the most frequently used features. Using the context keys you can also open a finger scrollable list of all programs currently installed on your device. The list is dynamic, so as soon as you add new apps, it gets updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that pretty much gets all of them covered. We guess, it's been a long reading and that alone should hint you that the number of tabs is a bit too much. Luckily the HTC Touch HD allows you to decide which tabs get shown and even their order. Sure, this could be achieved on the Touch Diamond too but a 3rd party application was needed for that purpose. At least HTC got this part right - now how about a ROM for that internet tab, eh?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows beneath<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get past the Home screen and all the finger sweeps and animations though, all you are left with is the Windows Mobile Professional OS. The massive screen and the nicely scaled UI of HTC Touch HD makes even that easily thumbable and almost every icon is easy to press without taking out the stylus. And since we're not fond at all of the so-very-outdated stylus, this came as a real treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also give credit to HTC for making an effort to improve the core Windows usability too. Some of the most used system settings, contacts management, and the messaging department have all benefited, and so have image and web browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is good indeed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contacts list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have spiced up the default WinMo contacts list by adding thumb scrolling (a slower sweep scrolls them gradually, while a fast single sweep scrolls the whole list from top to bottom). You can also pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right. Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact you have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance, those are not enough, you can always rename some of the existing ones and use them instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the long list of available fields, when viewing a contact's details, only those that are actually filled show up. A really nice feature is the Last call details that appear alongside every contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is uncompromised<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is usually a priority for every cell phone - that still holds true for smart devices such as the HTC Touch HD. We didn't experience any problems with our calls on the Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Phone application offers smart dialing, you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you put the HD to your ear, the display automatically switches off to avoid accidental presses. To do so, it uses a proximity sensor like the iPhone. Just as a reference, HTC Diamond relied on the embedded light sensor instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside to that is you need to press the On/Off key to turn the display back on during the call. But once you do, it stays on until you've finished your conversation. You can also activate the display by taking out the stylus which automatically starts the notes application. It even puts down the call details (the other party name and the time of call) on the note for you, which is as convenient as we might imagine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the HTC Touch HD has another cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself. At least, it's unlikely to get your calls muted accidentally in your pocket - the feature is so set up that it's more likely to not engage at all, rather than engage for no reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that if the phone is already face down when a call comes in, the feature won't be available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD also comes with the reject call with SMS feature. When you reject a call, the handset automatically sends the rejected caller a preset text message. We've never found that particularly useful, since you may have a dozen of different reasons to reject a call and there's hardly a universal message text that can cater to them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with the HTC HD, the SMS is not sent automatically. Instead you are prompted to review and possibly edit the template before dispatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries but one of the worst looking interfaces available. Luckily, HTC have dramatically improved them and have also added thumb scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To conclude the phone part review of the Touch HD, we measured the loudspeaker performance as part of our reviewing routine. You surely won't miss any calls with it, as it's loud enough to score the Good mark. Here's how the HTC Touch HD ranks along several other smart devices. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is well organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor. Thanks to TouchFLO you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of Windows 6.1, users enjoy threaded SMS, so you can be sure you get that feature on the Touch HD. The HTC Touch HD also offers Message delivery reports in its Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox holds no surprises to experienced WinMo users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks like the right moment to elaborate on the input options on the HTC Touch HD. HTC have equipped the device with a set of home-grown keyboards and keypads, most of which are rather nicely designed. Since the default Windows Mobile is hardly usable for anything we are more than happy with the HTC effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first keyboard is full QWERTY, the second one is a SureType offshoot (QW-ER-TY) and, finally, the third one is a regular 9-key multi-tap keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the applications where screen auto rotation is enabled, you also get larger landscape versions of those keyboards. Unfortunately, except for the web browser the auto screen rotation and text input paths never cross on the HTC Touch HD. It's a real shame since the messaging could really use one of those landscape QWERTYs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>That's an excellent image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch HD offers a nice thumbnail browser straight from the Photos and Videos tab on the Home screen. There's another thumbnail browser in the Album app available from the context menu on the Home screen or the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once an image is opened, you can make use of auto screen rotation to view it in landscape mode or you can zoom in with a circular gesture over the part of the image you want to zoom in on (it just doesn't get any cooler than that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you zoom in on the image you can start panning by holding your thumb down for a second. The Albums application also offers a customizable slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling to the next image is a matter of a single finger sweep and it's almost instantaneous. The image viewer actually has the same functionality as in the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, switching to landscape mode is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got to be said that the Touch HD has a certain advantage over competing devices when it comes to image browsing since this is one of the applications where WVGA resolution does count big time. The images look great on the huge high-res screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And there's a cool music player too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the HTC Touch Diamond, the Touch HD has a good music player, which makes heavy use of album art. The music player is accessible straight from the TouchFLO home screen with cool cover flow animation for you to pick an album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other criteria beside album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and gets as close to Apple's omnipresent iPhone as we have seen any gadget go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile devices have never been known for even decent audio output. Their business mindset has so far served as a good excuse for the poor audio. However, the HD is keen as never before on multimedia, so it better has audio quality up to the high bar it has set for itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio is quite up to standard in fact, having great noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings. The IMD and THD levels are also decent, albeit not spectacular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems as though HTC have put some sort of filter in the Touch HD, resulting in the frequency response graph you can see posted below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Touch HD is yet another (following Diamond and the Pro) step up in audio quality for Windows mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch HD vs Apple iPod frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio also aboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch HD built-in FM radio requires a headset plugged-in to work. Thanks to the built-in 3.5mm audio jack you are no longer limited to the originally provided headset. You can plug your favorite set of headphones as easy as 1-2-3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch HD FM radio has an excellent interface much like the rest of the multimedia players on board and offers memory for some 20 radio stations. And with RDS also available we can hardly want more (except perhaps Traffic announcements, but come on we're talking a mobile phone here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD has a nice video player but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to Winodws. To enjoy a more versatile video support on the Touch HD (DiVX or XViD for example), another video player would be required, which has support for more file types than the stock variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of dedicated video players on the market to expand the video-playing options on the Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We resorted to the well-known Core player. The HTC Touch HD is pretty good at WVGA-res XviD video playback - we played an XviD encoded DVD Rip for PC playback and, luckily, there were hardly skipped frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness the performance in some cases is a tad worse than it was on the HTC Touch Diamond (around 20%) but that could be expected with quite a lot more pixels that need to be refreshed (around 20%). The end result of watching videos on such a big display is however is totally worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos up to VGA resolution and bitrates up to 1.2 Mbps are OK with the Touch HD but going beyond those number is sure to result in skipped frames. If you ask us, this range is good enough for a handheld video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in conclusion, the HD huge WVGA display did count bigtime here: the video looked excellent, miles ahead of other devices. We cant imagine the guys who love to watch videos on their handsets making a better choice than the HTC Touch HD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Surprising camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What now seems a small step for the mobile industry proved a giant leap for HTC. Anyway, they are finally hitting the 5 megapixel scene and by the looks of it the wait may have been well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the 5MP breakthrough must have taken everyone at HTC by surprise. Or someone was so excited they forgot to fix the camera chapter of the standard Windows Mobile Help, which still claims the primary shooter is a 3.2 megapixel unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the Help texts, HTC Touch HD has a 5 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The camera shoots only in landscape mode. It lacks a dedicated camera key so focusing and actual shooting are entrusted to the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus engages when you touch the shutter icon on the screen and then the handset proceeds to take the photo. It sounds quite inconvenient and in fact it is. This way you get little-to-no chance of deciding not to take a photo after focusing. A Shoot Option setting is there to give you somewhat better control of the situation. You can opt between Touch and Touch-and-Hold, the latter leaving you about a second or two to change your mind and not take the shot after focus is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD camera lacks a flash, which basically renders night photography impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera interface and features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch HD doesn't use its whole display as a viewfinder and has a reserved space for the shutter icon to the right. Since the display aspect ratio is different from the aspect ratio of the camera sensor this is understandable. And with a display of this size the frame still remains more than clearly visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will find though that the default setting for the viewfinder is a fullscreen view, which naturally leads to some sort of cropping - part of the image that's actually taken is not visible on the viewfinder when you shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC Touch HD isn't the best equipped 5MP camera we have seen. It still offers a self-timer, white balance presets, as well as color effects, and a viewfinder gridline. You can shoot images with the front-facing video-call camera too and there's some nice custom resolution setting for contacts' images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting among its features is probably the touch focus which allows you to focus on any object in the frame by simply touching the display. While we aren't quite sure how useful it is in real life terms, the feature is quite well working, refocusing instantly and quite precisely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 has that same feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest letdown, when it comes to features, is that the camera lacks geotagging. The third party remedy for this is already found but we still can't figure out why HTC saved themselves the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Touch HD you can shoot macro images easily without changing modes or anything. Luckily the focusing is improved over what we saw in the Diamond and the Touch Pro. There are still a few shots where it failed to get proper focus but those were rare enough and not too badly missed either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a panorama mode that offers on-screen framing guidance. After all the individual shots for the pano are taken, the HD stitches the images automatically. The downside here is that in Panorama mode each individual image is shot at about 480 x 480 pixels. Plus, images aren't seamlessly stitched. Obviously, the Panorama mode is only ok if you intend to show your images on the handset display exclusively (which is exactly 480 pixels wide) with no further zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of HTC Touch HD is what caught us totally unprepared. Noise is kept well under control and the amount of resolved detail is high - the Touch HD beats down even Nokia N82 on both parameters. The reproduced colors aren't too precise though but on most occasions they were close enough. There is also no extreme oversharpening, but the sharpening levels are too high for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressed as we were by its initial results, we held an impromptu shootout between the HTC Touch HD, its main rival - the Samsung i900 Omnia and Nokia N82, which is one of the best 5MP shooters on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results came to confirm our first observations - the HD has the lowest amount of noise among the three contenders and has higher resolved detail than Nokia N82. The Omnia was hardly in the game at all - it got blown out of the water by both the the HD and N82.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Touch HD image quality is hardly flawless. When shooting high-contrast scenes with bright sun and harsh shadows, the advantage of Nokia N82 and even Samsung i900 Omnia becomes obvious. The HTC Touch HD is really short on dynamic range and its fuses blow off (eradicating detail and clipping the highlights on large portions of the image) each time you give it a tough contrasty scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the HTC Touch HD camera is almost certain to fail capturing right your beach or snowy mountain shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the camera performance of the Touch HD is a huge leap forward for the HTC. We are quite positive that this is the best camera on a Windows Mobile PocketPC we have seen so far. The Touch HD has confidently closed the gap between the very best in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who knows - the way things are going maybe we'll have a WinMo contender in our next camera shootout!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Touch HD video capturing capabilities are utterly unimpressive. All you get is CIF recording (352 x 288 pixel) at 30fps. It's not that bad: after all the VideoCD standard uses that resolution, but it's nowhere near what you would expect in a high-end smart device with ample processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles that of the still camera. You can only adjust white balance, resolution and brightness and add some color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video produced by the Touch HD. It's an MPEG4 recording in CIF resolution at 30fps - what you see is what you get.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity and web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its PocketPC nature, the Touch HD offers unsurpassed connectivity - HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi, and stereo Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR are all on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD has quad-band GSM and dual-band UMTS support, which make it capable of global roaming. However the 3G will only be available in the regions where the 900 and 2100 MHz bands are supported (read: Europe and the likes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 support is also present of course and every time you plug in the USB cable the HD prompts selecting between ActiveSync and USB Mass Storage and Modem connection. The Modem connection prompt is a new one and was not present on the Touch Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the HTC Touch HD has a microSD card slot which - given the fact that you have the right card reader around - can grant you the fastest data transfers available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of fast data transfers, the Touch HD managed to surprise us a bit. We tested the read/write performance in real life tasks. We concluded our real-life test on a Windows XP-based PC paired with the Touch HD in USB Mass Storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It showed some outstanding results in the Write operation (PC-to-HD), but the Read operation (HD-to-PC) was almost tenfold slower. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch HD copy/paste performance:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Diamond copy/paste performance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that those figures will be even lower on a Vista-based PC for some Microsoft-only-knows-why reason. That's another story entirely and we'd rather stay out of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is really good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD is equipped with the latest version of the Opera browser, which makes the Internet Explorer Mobile look like MS paint next to Photoshop CS4. The Opera 9.5 browser is extensively touch-optimized and seems heavily inspired by the iPhone Safari browser. However, the Opera 9.5 mobile web browser is still in its beta stages, which alone should hint at some bugs. Luckily none of them are serious enough to ruin the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA resolution display snatches a point again in the web browsing department. When the browser loads the full website preview, the minute text is still quite readable. Almost the whole of our website can fit on the display and the content remains recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While usability falls slightly short of the Safari browser, the Opera 9.5 has full support for Flash and Java content (was it really that hard, Apple?). Besides the browser has a nice download manager and copy/paste functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, when you zoom in, the browser wraps text, so the content fits the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Touch HD offers automatic screen rotation inside the web browser, the Opera 9.5 is pretty much the only place where a landscape QWERTY keyboard is available for text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a few words about the Opera 9.5 interface. By default web pages are opened fullscreen free of any overlaying controls. A tap on the bottom right corner however brings up the available controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher, the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with MS Outlook. As of Windows Mobile 6.0, the Calendar allows browsing the events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. You can also hide weekends from the Calendar if you use it for business strictly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder and Calculator go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the few customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mobile office: managing your documents the right way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of the Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the WVGA display of the HD proves superior in fitting much more of the documents than other handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the HD in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search software, capable of searching throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software (don't worry Teeter is here)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the Diamond and the Touch Pro, HTC Touch HD comes loaded with plenty of extra applications that extend the functionality of the handset. It's got regular stuff such as the RSS Reader and Streaming Media manager, but it has some really original applications to go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's nice of HTC to have preinstalled a great Task Manager on the HD. Both nicely looking and convenient it is available at the TouchFLO homescreen top right corner. It is also accessible through the settings menu if you prefer to access it that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS Hub app is an RSS reader for staying abreast of the latest news and content at your favorite web places. The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch HD also ships with the MP3 Trimmer app. It allows you to crop MP3 tracks to make your own ringtones. Another goodie is the Remote Desktop Mobile client. It allows you to connect remotely to any Windows-based computer. It's a really handy feature that - if you ask us - should come preinstalled on all PocketPCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, one of the most impressive parts of the HD software is the Teeter game, which puts the built-in accelerometer to good use. If you are an upgrader from the HTC Touch Diamond you are probably already familiar with it but on this screen the game is all the more impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The game itself consists of navigating a ball around a maze of holes. Teeter easily impresses with its polished graphics and the handset even produces well-balanced vibrations each time your ball hits the walls of the maze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, kudos to HTC for the excellent YouTube client, which offers a fluid and excellent looking interface - even better than the one on iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third-party application support seems wide with the very start of the HD sales and we suspect that it will get excellent in a few months time when most application developers add the WVGA resolution support. For the time being you can check out the following app compatibility list for the Touch HD. Bear in mind that it's a user contributed list and is by no means exhaustive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD features a built-in GPS receiver - it's the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, which comes along with the 7201A platform. It's the same chipset used in earlier HTC models such as the Diamond and the Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD also supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch HD doesn't have a GPS navigation application pre-installed, so you have to purchase one separately. With a dedicated GPS app installed, the handset can easily replace your dedicated GPS navigation unit thanks to the large screen estate. Given the huge pixel count, a lot more of the map gets displayed on screen at the same zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chipset sensitivity of the HTC Touch HD seems to be on the faster side when it comes to getting an initial satellite lock.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And we've finally reach the real fun part of this review - at least for us, that is. PocketPCs have long been the target of custom modding, patching and tweaking. HTC for one have an especially wide and busy fan base that seems to be constantly poking and prodding for a new twist to their gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Touch HD review would not be complete without mentioning some of the achievements on the user customization and modding scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's the screen auto rotation limitations that HTC have imposed on the Touch HD. By default, screen auto rotation only works in the web browser, image gallery and video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gyrator app, which works on the Touch Diamond the Touch Pro just as well, enables the automatic screen rotation for the Touch HD almost all across the interface - except for the Home screen. An added bonus is that you can set specific system or app events to be triggered in reponse to the handset movement. For example, you can answer a call by simply picking up the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the HTC dialer doesn't seem to work correctly in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about Gyrator and download the latest version over at its developer's website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a link to various videos displaying it in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a whole list of other customizable options that require you to edit the Windows Mobile system registry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, you can set the HD to wake up on an incoming SMS, enable geotagging, or unlock hidden camera modes, such as Burst or Sport. You can also control stuff like TouchFLO scroll speed or the turn-over-to-mute feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list is long and it keeps growing, as more users give in to the Touch HD allure and keenly mess around with its system settings. A nice starting point is this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in case you feel anxious about messing with the system registry, you can find most of the currently available tweaks among the options of the Advanced Configuration Tool (or simply the Advanced Config). This is a third-party tweaking app that is now compatible with Touch HD just as it was with the Touch Diamond. It allows easier tweaking of most without registry edits whatsoever. You can learn more about it and download it here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch HD is guaranteed to change the way people think of Windows Mobile. It is a bold and confident step, taking full advantage of all the hardware and software strengths and a worthy effort of addressing the weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still quite a number of performance issues but the problems of Windows OS are far too deep to disappear overnight. Still, if modding and tweaking is your game, you can fix quite a lot of the issues that come out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while this certainly isn't a flawless phone, the results are impressive indeed. The multimedia power of the HD is immense, and only a touch away on that huge screen. The high-resolution camera and the tons of software available, make the HD a truly attractive package. And with looks like those - what more can you possibly want in a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great response and sweet thumb-optimized handling are remarkable (in WinMo terms) but that's hardly an achievement of the Touch HD alone. The company's headliner is the cutting edge of a consistent effort that started back with the HTC Touch and went sky-high with the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crown of that effort, HTC Touch HD, is now set on a path pretty much signposted by iPhone. Its driving inspiration has brought to the scene a capable candidate for a hefty bite at the apple.</paragraph>
