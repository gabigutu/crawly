		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, as the far too long name suggests, is yet another incarnation of the original Galaxy S. Sure, it has grown an extra CPU core, to go with its 42Mbps network connectivity, but at the end of the day, the newcomer packs a lot of the I9000 DNA and hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, the CPU and chipset of the Galaxy S Blaze 4G, unlike the rest of its hardware, have not remained in 2010. The smartphone packs Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 silicon with two Scorpion cores, clocked at 1.5GHz. Throw in NFC connectivity, and we are looking at a seriously capable, 2012 mid-range smartphone. Here goes the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G full list of talents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as specifications and looks are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G appears to be mostly a shrunken copy of one of T-Mobile's Android flagships - the Samsung Galaxy S II. This is definitely not bad news for the handset, as there are plenty of people out there who find the 4.52" sporting Galaxy S II a tad too large.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the upsides of having a powerful CPU, packed into a compact body are more than evident, we can't help but look at the PenTile matrix sporting screen with a dash of suspicion. The same applies to the TouchWiz-ed Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread of the smartphone - it is not exactly cutting edge this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to kick this review off by unboxing the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G for T-Mobile is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the T-Mobile branded retail box of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, you will find a charger, a microUSB cable, as well as a SD adapter for the 4GB microSD card, which ships with the phone. The latter is already inserted in the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While a pair of headphones would have certainly been a welcome sight in the box, we can't help but appreciate the presence of a microSD card in the retail package. After all, the recent trend on the U.S. market is for both items to be missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are barely any surprises regarding the design of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G. Like we mentioned to you earlier, the device looks like a mini version of the T-Mobile Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get a bit more interesting on the back of the smartphone. With the metal bezel on top, it looks a lot like a BlackBerry Torch 9860. Thankfully, the massive "Galaxy S" logo quickly disperses any berry related associations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only color scheme offered for the device at the moment is black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is solid as always. The smartphone is a blend of high quality plastic and metal. Like all Android smartphones made by Samsung, the Galaxy S Blaze 4G looks like it can take a daily beating with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G are one of its strong points. They are 121.7 x 62.9 x 11.2 mm, while the device's weight is 127 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4" Super AMOLED screen with WVGA resolution is more than just a familiar sight by now. It is featured in quite a few Samsung devices for a good reason - its contrast ratios and viewing angles are still among the best in the business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the display's PenTile matrix. It lowers the screen's perceived resolution to a point, where you can see the actual pixels without trying too hard, thus seriously hampering the smartphone's upmarket-ish ambitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is where the earpiece, the usual set of sensors, as well as the front facing camera are located. Below it you have the ubiquitous for all U.S. Samsung droids, four touch sensitive buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker, along with the latch for removing the battery cover is located on the left side. On the right, you will find the power/lock key, as well as the hot swappable microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack of the handset sits lonely at the top. The microUSB port and mouthpiece reside at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera, its LED flash, the loudspeaker grille, as well as a "Galaxy S" logo are sitting at the top of the device's back. There is a miniscule chin at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, there are no surprises. The SIM card is hot swappable. The 1750mAh battery has NFC talents to go with its usual duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G achieved an endurance rating of 39 in our battery test. This means that you will need to recharge your device every 39 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the handset is by no means a record breaker battery performance wise, it will easily make it through a full day of normal use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the battery test of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G is a pleasure. The 4" screen allows a hassle-free one handed operation when necessary. The back has a fine and grippy texture to it, so accidental drops are not likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were absolutely no surprises about the design and build quality of the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, save for the design slip with the device's back. It is solidly put together and easy to operate. The screen however, could have been way better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is now time to take a look at the software of the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android Gingerbread and TouchWiz 4.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G runs Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread with Samsung's TouchWiz launcher out of the box. The experience which the device offers is the same as every top shelf Samsung smartphone on the market today. Check it out in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen holds no surprises. It can be swiped away in any direction. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreens. A pinch zoom brings you to an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be edited: rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a drawer that appears at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose List view instead of the regular grid view if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. You can swap the first three with different ones (by default the shortcuts are Phone, Contacts, Messaging), the fourth one being locked. It's the app drawer/home shortcut so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly remodeled in TouchWiz 4.0, but there aren't any major changes to the functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager, which Samsung have preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. It also comes with a handy widget, which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G comes with a large amount of pre-installed non-removable, proprietary T-Mobile apps. Their usability is beyond questionable - there is simply no need for them. Unfortunately, if you don't want to have your app launcher sprinkled with magenta colored icons (very annoying by the way), rooting your device is the only way to have it done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Qualcomm's Snapdragon S3 chipset and its two Scorpion cores, clocked at 1.5GHz are a rather powerful combination in the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, and the benchmark scores prove it. The relatively low screen resolution also helps here - the CPU simply has fewer pixels to deal with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's real life performance was faultless. It handled every task we threw its way without breaking any sweat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is as good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - a tap adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only Facebook and LinkedIn contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S Blaze 4G had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with contact photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is among the best in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts so it's easy to tell which email was pulled from which account. Conversation view is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also on board here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype and Eyes-Free keyboards. All are fairly comfortable, although if you're coming from a bigger screen, the keys might feel a little cramped. The landscape keyboard should be good enough though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery, photo editor, and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Blaze 4G uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically compiles the images and videos no matter in which folder they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. It supports sharing images over Bluetooth, email, messaging along with uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor preinstalled. It handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It's not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill - similar to Photoshop's Context-aware fill tool although, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs or FF/rewind by sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There's 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitle sync (time them back or forth) but there's no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G comes with a 5MP camera and an LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its interface looks familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get the front/back camera switch and the flash control. You can replace those two and add two more (for a total of four) shortcuts to any option in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality wise, the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G has lots of potential. It produces tack sharp photos with plenty of detail. Colors are neutral and overall we're pretty happy with the results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shoots 720p video at 30fps. Unlike the still camera, you can't use the video-call camera to shoot videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality of the footage captured by the camcorder is not the best we've seen but it's really alright. Diagonal lines are not quite straight and have lots of jaggies and image sharpness is not the best. But again, there aren't any serious faults with the videos either. They turn out nice and smooth with the same neutral color tones as the ones of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p video sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 720p video clip for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity ticks (almost) all the right boxes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and tri-band 3G with HSPA+ (42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink). T-Mobile's network is quite possibly the best way to experience mobile data in a non-LTE fashion. The coverage in the New York City area is superb and so were the speeds we experienced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 for fast and energy-efficient local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support and a Wi-Fi hotspot option, carrier permitting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity is present as well. There is a dedicated app, called Tags, which utilizes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer's web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone - from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who's connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A solid web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as usual, quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another neat trick is the browser-specific brightness setting. You can, for example, boost the brightness in the browser to comfortably view your web pages but keep the general brightness low to conserve battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is a document editor at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G comes with Polaris Office preinstalled. It's one of the most feature-rich mobile editors around. You can view, edit and create Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (Office 2003 and Office 2007 are supported) and there's a PDF viewer as well. The app enables searching your office files just like in a file explorer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer with a ton of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: list, daily, weekly, monthly and annually. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S 4G features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a To-Do app called Task and a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America. It is still in Beta though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google recently changed the name of the Android Market in the United States to Google Play Store. The idea behind the move was to put all content, available for your Android device under the same roof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite frankly, the new name and launch icon aside, you will be hard pressed to find any major differences between the old and new setup. See for yourself below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G packs enough functionality to keep every potential Android user, who thinks that a screen over 4" in size is too big happy. It is well built, fast, and pocket friendly. It's also got some powerful hardware that makes it relatively future proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone however, is far from perfect. Its Super AMOLED screen has remained in 2010. Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread with TouchWiz 4 on the other hand, while perfectly polished, is quite far from being at the cutting edge of the Android realm. The lack of an Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update timeline does not help the handset's cause either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G costs $149.99 with a two-year commitment to the Big Magenta. Its price tag puts it in the thick of the Android smartphone competition. You can actually pick up even more capable hardware for less money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A two-year commitment to AT&amp;T and $9.99 for example will get you a Samsung Galaxy S II I777. It is better than the Galaxy S Blaze in absolutely every aspect, save for the network speed. If you can live with its bigger screen, you should conisder this one. Samsung surely won't mind, we promise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II I777</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of AT&amp;T, you can get on the carrier's LTE bandwagon for as little as $49.99. This is the price tag of the entry-level Pantech Burst. Another $50 more will get you an ICS packing HTC Vivid, or an LG Nitro HD. All three offer a lot more than the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, together with a lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pantech Burst ? HTC Vivid ? LG Nitro HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G has some heavy competition to face. The newcomer however packs one major feature, which will help it find quite a few fans. The device, thanks to its 4" screen, is more compact than every option we told you about save for the Pantech offering. In a world of ever expanding screen sizes, this matters a lot.</paragraph>
