			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a shrinking featurephone market, the Nokia Asha lineup is trying to deliver a near-smartphone experience with less complexity and, more crucially, at a more attractive price point. The Asha 306 slots just above the middle of the pack - delivering a touchscreen display and Wi-Fi connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 is aimed at those that value Wi-Fi connectivity over a second SIM slot (there's Asha 305 if that's not the case). Wi-Fi connectivity is the headline feature, but it's not everything the Asha 306 has going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 is no powerhouse, but then again, the target user for this one isn't really obsessed with specs. The Asha 306 makes sense for people looking for a straightforward handset for calling other people or are just on the lookout for a secondary phone, which should complement their smartphone without breaking the bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A case can be made that touch and simple don't really mix in times when pixels and clockspeeds are what drives the industry forward. Why not simply get a regular phone with a keypad. You'll save a little money and still get basically the same functionality in a possibly smaller package. An Asha 201 would cost you significantly less too. So why go for a Nokia Asha 306?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the new interface comes into play. It's not just a touchscreen you are getting here - you are actually purchasing something that enables even easier UI navigation. Web browsing is also way more intuitive on touchscreen devices and gaming benefits, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So can the Nokia Asha 306 deliver all it promises on such a tight budget? Read on to find out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing and retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Nokia Asha 306 is quite modest, which shouldn't be surprising considering the price of the phone. The complimentary 2GB microSD card is in fact a nice surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a set of headphones and a charger in the bundle too. It ends up with the old-fashioned Nokia charger plug but the Asha 306 supports USB charging too. The headset has a built-in microphone for hands-free calling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 306 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 is identical in size to the dual-SIM Asha 305. It's a compact set at 110.3 x 53.8 x 12.8 mm and weighs just 96 g but there's just too much screen bezel which makes you wonder whether the Asha 306 could've been a lot smaller. We wouldn't call it a slim phone either. But let's not get too greedy here - edge-to-edge screens belong to a different market segment and for it price the Asha 306 is decently sized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design-wise the Asha 306 is an exact copy of the Asha 305. It comes in variety of colors including Silver White, Mid Blue, Dark Gray and Red (as in the case of our review unit). There are two glossy pieces of plastic above and under the display, while the back cover has matte finish, which we like because it isn't as prone to fingerprints. It also has e better feel to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seems to be plenty of unused space above the 3" display, where the Nokia logo is. A thin strip underneath accommodates the call keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself is not too bright and there's no brightness setting whatsoever. The low resolution gives icons a dot-matrix-printer look and scrolling is like a stop-motion cartoon. The screen is extremely reflective and colors look washed out. To be fair though, poor image quality was to be expected here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are coming from a capacitive touchscreen device, you might find the resistive screen having poor response initially. Once you get the hang of it and start putting more pressure to your taps and swipes things start feeling better, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia even found a way to enable multi-touch. It's limited to the gallery but pinch zooming works rather well. Here's a photo of the screen's RGB matrix under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there's an earpiece and a brand logo. There're none of the usual sensors up there. There's no automatic screen brightness of course and no proximity sensor. The screen locks as soon as the call is connected and can be unlocked using the dedicated button. Only then can you access the onscreen in-call options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen you'll find the mouthpiece on the thin strip of plastic that accommodates the call and end keys. The end key will exit any currently running app and take you back to the homescreen. It's a power button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Nokia Asha 306 is the volume rocker and the lock button. Near the bottom you'll see a rather deep and wide slit for removing the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under a sealed plastic lid lies the MicroSD card on the left side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is placed at the top of the device alongside a 3.5 mm headphones jack and the older standard charging port. The Asha 306 comes with one of those old-school Nokia chargers but can be charged off USB too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Nokia Asha 306 is the only place where a more conventional matte finish has been deployed. You'll find the 2 MP camera lens there, along with another engraved Nokia logo and the loudspeaker grille. The Asha 306 is powered by a 1110 mAh Li-Ion battery and inside the battery compartment is the SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't say we're too fond of the Nokia Asha 306 in terms of design but the phone is certainly well put together. The handset looks like it's using parts of other Nokias and there's too much gloss. Fingerprints are too much of an issue but overall, it's the looks that raise doubts not durability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 thinks it's MeeGo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have decent experience with the new Asha Touch variation of the Series 40 software and we like what Nokia has done with its best-selling platform. The software takes a lot of design cues from its Symbian (or "Nokia OS" if you will) and MeeGo brothers, and as such the user interface structure is based on the MeeGo one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All interactions are touch-based, except for the red receiver key which is a handy way to bring out the homescreen or close an app. Here's the Asha 306 in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen offers a big clock with the date underneath. A familiar sideways swipe unlocks the phone. Before you do that, you must first wake up the screen, of course. To do that you need to press the hardware lock key; double tap like on the Nokia N9 doesn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is an arrangement of three side-scrollable homescreens in MeeGo fashion. The default one is the app launcher - the new Asha Touch gets straight to business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left will take you to the dialer. In fact, this screen can be customized to show either the music player or the radio, but having the dialer always a swipe away is probably the most useful of the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third homescreen is what was previously known as Active Standby. It's now a pane to fill with shortcuts to frequently used apps or contacts. A tap and hold on that screen triggers Edit mode, so you can choose shortcuts and contacts to add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the time and date are displayed too, which in turn serve as shortcuts to the alarm app and the calendar. There are no other widgets available here unfortunately, e.g. a music player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status bar is visible on top of any of the three screens and you can either tap to expand it or pull it down. It displays notifications of missed events and quick toggles for mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sound profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you get shortcuts to the music player, the phone and messaging apps. While S40 Asha Touch doesn't really do multitasking, those three apps are almost always available to you, even inside Java apps (the only exception is full screen apps). You can change the track, send a message, make a call and go back to where you left your app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications are displayed on the lockscreen too. A convenient shortcut is swiping a notification, which will take you to the relevant app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tiny number icon on the Messaging icon in the app launcher shows the text messages you have received but not yet read. There are similar new email notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a missed call that requires your attention, the notification area drops down a bit to briefly display the number and then pulls back up. It leaves a small handle as a reminder, which you can pull to see who's been calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are minor but nice touches to a completely revamped interface, which is surprisingly feature-rich, yet beautifully simple. Soft keys are nowhere in sight - every app or screen you open has just a tiny back key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't miss multitasking, which will never be a part of S40. The Asha 306 comes with all the essential functions as native apps, so they can receive notifications in the background, and the call/text/music functionality is always accessible. It's the most common use case - especially considering there aren't that many third-party apps to switch between (e.g. you're not going to use a third-party music player).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 uses the same hardware as the 305 and that doesn't quite have the processor power to run the complex UI as smooth as we would have liked. There's noticeable lag as you scroll through the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, part of what ruins the experience is the resistive touch, which requires a stronger push to register a touch than a capacitive screen does and we often ended up hitting all sorts of icons unintentionally when we lightened the pressure of our fingers on the screen.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 phonebook has a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 features a redone Series 40 phonebook. Under the new Asha Touch interface it integrates with the Call log and the Dialer, which is a common arrangement among smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are displayed with a photo and number and, on top of the actual list, you get the Advanced menu and Add new contact shortcut. Then comes the search field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual contact details are displayed on a completely redesigned screen compared to previous S40 phonebooks. You get a faded contact's picture as a background, with a huge name across and a number below. A few big thumbable icons at the bottom of the screen let you call, text or email the person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, email address, ringtone or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - the SIM card or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the most part, the telephony options on the Asha 306 are pretty straightforward. The in-call sound is loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already said, the Contacts, the Call Log and the dialer are integrated like in mature smart platforms. What's missing is smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no reception problems with the Nokia Asha 306. We tested its loudspeaker and found it loud enough, as loud as the one on the Asha 311, but not as loud as the 305.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is as good as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in the default view of the messaging app lets you delete the conversation or call/email the contact in question instead. Creating a message is pretty straightforward. You can add multiple contacts from your phonebook or simply punch in numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text entry, you can choose between a portrait multitap keypad, portrait QWERTY keyboard and a landscape QWERTY keyboard. You get a character and message counter either way. Unfortunately, there's no text selection or copying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The portrait multitap keyboard is accurate and can be fairly fast if you enable text prediction. The portrait QWERTY is quite cramped on the 3" screen and the resistive screen requires a bit more pressure than we're used to after using capacitive screens for so long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's possible to type on in, but in general our thumbs didn't have the accuracy needed to do it error-free. Flipping the phone horizontally gives the keyboard a lot more room to work with and accuracy is not an issue. We still wish we had a sensitive capacitive touchscreen to work with, the experience on the Asha 311 was better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL. When we set up our Gmail account, the app asked us if we want to sign in Gtalk too, which was a pleasant surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between accounts from the fourth tab at the bottom of the screen. The default email view is Inbox but Folder view is supported too, though there's no combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple emails can be moved or deleted using the advanced menu in the top left corner. A tap and hold on an email will allow you to reply, delete, star, forward or mark it as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and a small * appears on the Mail icon in the app launcher when a new email has arrived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chat client supports multiple services - Facebook, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, Yahoo and Nokia Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly and those services can run in the background (a circle in the status bar shows your status when you're online, e.g. green for "available", red for "busy").</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 has something that makes the (supposedly dumb) S40 UI look much smarter than the likes of iOS and Windows Phone (even stock Android out of the box). That's right, we are talking about a full-featured file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is called Files and lists all your local folders with the memory card on top. Different icons are available for the different file types, the multimedia files appear with small thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few handy options are available in the advanced menu - change view and sorting, add new folder or mark some/all files. If you tap and hold on a file you'll get options such as copy, cut, paste, rename, delete, mark and details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has everything you may need in a file browser and puts to shame many smart file explorers thanks to its simple yet powerful interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Functional gallery and photo editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is a Symbian copycat. Photos are displayed in a three-column grid, with kinetic scrolling enabled. The gallery has one problem - it can't show more than 1000 images. So if your memory card is full of pictures, the Asha 306 is not the best choice of device to browse them on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize your photos into albums and there is an album view as a separate tab in the gallery. The video section is the final tab and lists any supported videos you've uploaded on your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a file lets you rename, delete, share or assign the image to a contact or set it as wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto-rotation and pinch zooming are enabled in the gallery. The phone handles 2MP photos from its camera well enough, but there's still some lag when zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit pictures from the advanced menu. The available options are crop, rotate, flip, effects, warp, add frame, clip art, add text, adjust brightness and contrast, retune colors or do auto enhance. Not bad, is it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The renovated music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has a rather basic interface with lots of hidden features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen displays a large album art picture, alongside the track name, a scrubber and music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen has three tabs, the first one being the Now Playing screen. The next one is the Library with the default sorting options - all tracks, artists, albums, genres and videos. The last tab has your custom playlists with a few default ones available - recently added, recently played, most played and now playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shuffle, repeat and equalizers are available too. You can also play music over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player supports background playback, but there are no quick controls in the notification area or the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia Asha 306 comes with a neat and simple interface. You can change stations with the dedicated controls at the bottom. There is a tab with all available stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio has RDS support and automatic rescanning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We expected the Nokia Asha 306 to have an audio output identical to that of the Nokia Asha 305, but it turns out that the two actually performed slightly differently. It could be that Nokia is using more than one supplier for the audio chips of the Asha phones or just some unit-to-unit variation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 306 does decently well, achieving some good (if some way off the best we have seen) scores and garnishing them with extremely high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones leads to notable spike in intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk as well as some further deviation of the frequency response. It's not too bad overall, but it's certainly not as good as the best on the market. Plus, the volume levels drop to average here, so the Asha 306 only gets a good overall mark, instead of excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player within this version of Series 40. You can find you videos in the dedicated video tab of either the gallery or the music player. Or browse them in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 failed to play almost every video file we threw at it, except a QVGA MP4 clip (higher-res MP4s like nHD didn't work). Surprisingly, the phone managed to play the audio of some 1080p music videos, so we could at least listen to those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 has a 2MP fixed-focus camera that produces photos at maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. The camera interface has been updated but still offers just a few settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera's main UI has four shortcuts in each corner of the viewfinder and surprise - they're orientation aware. The virtual shutter key is always in the bottom center and the back key is always in the bottom right corner, which makes for an awkward-looking reshuffle when the screen changes orientation (it's not the fastest auto-rotate around either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapping a photo takes at least 5 seconds, so you have to make each shot count as the camera will take a while before it's ready to snap another photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have settings, camcorder/still camera toggle and a shortcut to the gallery. The virtual shutter is always centered at the bottom, whether in portrait or landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Settings you can set effects, self-timer, grid and scenes. There is a deeper Advanced settings menu with resolution options, camera sounds, orientation, etc. One unusual feature is called "Funny sounds", which plays one of several funny sounds just before snapping a photo, to get your subjects to laugh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you would expect, the quality is nothing to write home about and there's plenty of visible noise when you view photos at 100% (and at this resolution, they fit entirely on a desktop monitor). Still, photos are good enough for Facebook, especially if you and your friends do most of social networking on a mobile device like the Asha 306.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You can record video, if you call QCIF@10 fps video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 can record QCIF videos at 10 fps. Let that sink in for a moment. When it comes to bottom of the barrel cameras we usually say "well, it's good enough for MMS," but that would be too generous for this camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the QCIF@10fps sample for you to check out. It's 16 seconds long but the file is only 320KB, smaller than a lot of static images you'd find on a web page, you can imagine just how much "video" it's in there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2G Connectivity bolstered by Wi-Fi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 has the basics to get you connected to most things in most places. The phone has quad-band 2G for voice and GPRS/EDGE data connectivity everywhere with a GSM network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Wi-Fi b/g, which will get you faster data speeds and it doesn't eat into your data plan (if there even is one). Bluetooth 2.1 with EDR handles things like wireless handsfree dongles but also local file sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging and there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 306 also has a memory card slot (and a complimentary 2GB microSD card). Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is good, but sluggish<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 306 uses Nokia's cool Xpress Browser. Its start screen has a unified URL and search bar and a few handy shortcuts to favorite websites and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed interface offers one-tap access to Favorites, Downloads and Apps. The Favorites tab has the History, Home and Start page shortcuts, and you can add your own bookmarks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser does the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quickly (even on EDGE) and don't use much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get only two zoom levels (again, just like Opera Mini): page overview and zoomed in. A single tap will zoom in on the desired part of the page. To zoom back out to overview you need to hit a dedicated button in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the browser feels sluggish when you're interacting with the page and the kinetic scrolling animation is quite choppy. There's no Flash support, but we never expected it here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 306 is well stocked as usual and things have been nicely touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day view is also available, but there's no week view. You have various kinds of events available for setting up: reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo. The agenda, to-do and notes tabs in the calendar are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses big, touchable numbers, making it easy to set and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there's only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing features include a voice recorder with no time limit, a basic calculator and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a weather app and pre-installed Facebook and Twitter clients (combined within the Nokia Social app).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia S40 Store and bonus apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a feature phone having an app store at all is a major bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding stuff seems to be a problem as the search function in the store is pretty spotty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 306 owners have 40 EA games waiting for them in the Nokia Store - all for free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps is severely dumbed-down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 306 doesn't have a GPS receiver but Nokia Maps can use Cell-ID to get your approximate location. The app doesn't feature voice-guided navigation anyway and you can only plan pedestrian routes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, even if you hook up a Bluetooth GPS receiver to the Nokia Asha 306 it still won't function as a car SatNav. There's no option for a paid upgrade either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps are downloaded through your data connection, which is something else to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having a resistive screen, the Nokia Asha 306 supports pinch zooming, though maps do take a second to redraw. There are also the standard +/- zoom keys if pinching feels awkward on this screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you think of web browsing on a phone, you are probably imagining 4+" screens, LTE speeds and blazing benchmarks, but it's actually a phone like the Nokia Asha 306 that can really bring Internet connectivity to the masses - Nokia's "next billion" plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2G-only mobile data connection isn't ideal, but the phone's browser opens compressed web pages, which saves on both time and data allowance. You can also opt for Wi-Fi hotspots to get a faster connection for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3" WQVGA resistive touchscreen on the Asha 306 isn't the best there is, but it gives you Facebook and Twitter that are much easier to navigate than on an old-school keypad. The chat and email services that run in the background also boost your online presence, even without full smartphone functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two biggest issues with the Asha 306 is the dated chipset, which renders the otherwise good software sluggish, and the touchscreen, which just lacks the sensitivity of a capacitive unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may sound unfair that we're complaining about these things, but let's look at what you can buy at or around the price of the Asha 306.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 is the obvious first choice as it resolves both complaints, but it is pricier than the 306. Or, you can go dual-SIM with the Asha 305 but you will loose Wi-Fi in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newly announced Nokia Asha 309 is a bit of a middle ground between the 306 and 311, but that one isn't out yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Asha 311 ? Nokia Asha 305 ? Nokia Asha 309</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you insist on a touch-operated feature phone, then a Samsung S5260 Star II offers a screen with the same size/resolution but of the capacitive variety, plus there's a 3MP camera with QVGA@15fps video and the Star II is actually cheaper than the Asha.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much the same goes for the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S5260 Star II ? Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android phones have ventured as far down as the sub-?100 price range off contract. A Samsung Galaxy Pocket costs nearly the same as the Asha 306. True, it doesn't provide the smoothest of rides or the highest quality screen, but it's still a full-fledged droid. An LG Optimus L3 even has a bigger screen and a 3MP camera at the same price point. Both of these droids have 3G too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Pocket S5300 ? LG Optimus L3 E400</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia claims that their Asha Touch range has "full smartphone classification from global market research companies and analysts such as GfK and IDC" but, unfortunately for the Asha 306, it's competing against actual smartphones and cheaper touch phones in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the swipe interface is as good as feature phone UIs get (we're still reluctant to call the Ashas "smartphones") and the Asha 306 does have the Nokia pedigree. But in the end, the slow chipset, resistive touchscreen, no 3G and limited choice of apps make it hard to recommend the Nokia Asha 306 over a low-end Android or even against the Asha 311. Let's not forget though that there are still plenty of S30 phones around, whose users will find the Asha 306 a worthy upgrade.</paragraph>
