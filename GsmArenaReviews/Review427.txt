			<paragraph>Here comes the ideal mobile solution for all those who are not in love with clamshells, but do like Motorola Razr's slim design. Motorola has decided to continue the path marked by its popular Razr by launching a new line of slim phones with classic construction. The best equipped among them is the new Motorola SLVR L7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It all started with Motorola V3 Razr. Till the moment this model was launched no one would ever even dare think of such a slim mobile phone. The Razr model was a huge success and managed to get on top of the slim handsets. At present, all major manufacturers literally compete in introducing thin-construction devices. There is no wonder that Motorola gets back with 3 new models of the same line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from clamshells, it has also presented several phones with classic construction. It has already been some time since one of them, Motorola L6, hit the market. However if you find it insufficient in terms of functions, then you may want to try a higher-class model - Motorola SLVR L7, officially presented at CeBIT 2005.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola SLVR L7</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It can hardly be thinner<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that the most important advantage of the L7 model is its slimness - mere 12 mm. The other two dimensions are a bit larger than what is acceptable in the group of small phones, but even so Motorola SLVR L7 can be regarded as a very small device. In other words, 114 x 49 x 12 mm. The phone weighs 85 grams. The L7 model is narrower compared to Motorola Razr, due to which it goes perfectly onto one's palm. All areas of the keypad are easy to reach by thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It is really thin...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7 has a perfectly elaborated construction. It would not give out a single creak, even if pressed quite hard. The lock of the rear cover is located at the very top of the back side, above the camera, and is thus very strong. The phone didn't show any spaces or margins during the tests. The construction benefits a lot from the absence of removable covers too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Could that be aluminum?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The entire phone is made of thin metal plates, except for the keypad and the display. It looks like aluminum but polished in black. Unfortunately, finger prints remain pretty visible all over the device, including the display. The top button line of the keypad is located right below the display, so the chance that fingerprints may be kept away from the display surface is minor. You will have no other choice but to wipe it again and again. In this respect, a special wiping cloth would have come in extremely handy, if included in the original package of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design outlook of Motorola L7 catches the eye immediately. The front side of the device is totally flat. The only elements that bulge slightly are the main control button and the logo of the manufacturer located above the display. The same logo is to be found on the rear side of the phone, which also constitutes the battery cover. The grid of the loud speaker is located beneath the logo. The lens of the built-in camera is seated in a black trapezium with a silver frame in the very top of the rear cover. Btw, it is not protected and will probably get scratched quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nearly the entire rear side of the phone is removable ? camera lens ? speaker grid ? with removed cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have removed the rear cover of the phone you will need to press the silver button situated on the top. A lithium-ion battery of 820 mAh is hidden beneath. According to Motorola, the L7 model is able to manage 310 hours of stand-by work or 250 minutes of calls. In reality, the phone recorded pretty good results, remaining live for three entire days. The SIM card is inserted under the battery and can be replaced easily due to the presence of a small slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Plenty of buttons to be found on the sides of the phone ? left side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the phone there is a silver button, which activates the camera application. Above it there is a data connector of the miniUSB type, for which Motorola deserves a praise. Thanks to this connector the user does not need to buy an additional special data cable, but can deal with a standard cable, from a digital camera for example. The microSD(TransFlash) memory card slot is to be found in the bottom part of the right side of the device. It is protected by a rubber cap, which is easy to remove and at the same time difficult to loose as it is firmly hooked to the phone. On Motorola L7's left side you will find a pair of volume control buttons and the so called Smart key, whose function is a subject to one's own choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Matters of interest on the edges: miniUSB connector ? camera release button ? memory card slot</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A great part of the front is occupied by the display, which has a surface of 30 x 37 mm. Btw, Motorola designers could have made it even bigger by a few mm considering the black frame around it. There is a second, outer frame, whose color is the same as the color of the keypad. Imbedded in its top area is the manufacturer's logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the L7 model is brilliant, even if far from innovative. It is a spectacle for the eye thanks to the active TFT technology, the resolution of 176 x 220 pixels, and the presence of 262K vivid colors. The contrast is excellent. Brightness is possible to adjust in 7 steps, with the highest being so intensive that it will probably remain unused by most customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors remain bright even when the display is looked at from an acute angle. Yet, a few degrees of leaning downwards are enough to make the display go out. The backlighting is brilliant when active. If it is out, the display is completely illegible. In such case any check for received messages or missed calls requires activation of the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Zigzags<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In order to maintain the slim design of the device, the manufacturer has once again applied a flat keypad in the form of a metal plate with chemically etched keys. If you examine it well, you will see that both the keypad plate and the main control button are grinded with concentric circles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Razr-like ? navigation key is quite comfortable to use</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7's keypad is pretty flashy, but quite unpractical. It is not suitable for SMS writers no matter the fact that keys react well or that each press is accompanied by a discrete click. The keys are difficult to distinguish by touch and are thus frequently mistaken. One of the main inconveniences is the displacement of the middle key column by approximately half a key downwards. Orientation grooves provide little help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keys legends as well as orientation grooves stand out slightly above the keypad surface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from standard number keys and the classic pair of a red and a green receiver, here you will also find a pair of functional keys, a key that opens the context menu, and the main four-way control button with a central confirm part. Volume control buttons are located on the left side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keypad is intensive and evenly distributed. The keys legends as well as the grooves among them are illuminated in blue. If there is plenty of light around the device, the sensor on its top edge automatically deactivates the keypad backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad backlighting is impressive</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>We will hardly ever get used to it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7's interface and menu are pretty similar to those in other Motorola models, incl. Razr V3. The main display provides information about the network signal, the battery state, the active ringing profile, the name of the operator, the functions of the context keys and the current date and time. The clock can be viewed either in a digital or in an analog format. The name of the operator together with the current date can either be centered or aligned left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Various looks of the stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display also shows the icons that indicate the functions assigned to each way of the main control button (selection is available in the main menu). Any wallpaper from those available in the device can be placed as background on the main display. It is not animated though. The wallpaper gets replaced by an animated screen-saver after a relatively long time of inactivity. Once the screen-saver goes out too, the display becomes totally illegible. The menu outlook can be changed through the use of three preinstalled themes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has not undergone any significant changes either. It is offered in two versions - as a matrix of 9 animated icons or in the form of a text list. The order of the main menu items can be changed. With certain exceptions, the rest of the menu generally consists of text with tiny icons located in second level. Multimedia and Tools items are presented by big animated icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having worked with Motorola devices quite seldom, I find the organization of Motorola L7's menu somewhat illogical. If you switch to Motorola from a different brand, you will definitely need some time to get used to the way, in which its menu is organized, mainly because certain items are not where you would expect them to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various images of the matrix with icons on the main menu ? main menu in text format</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While examining the control functions of Motorola L7 I was surprised to find out that any text I would insert in the calendar would simply not get confirmed by a single press on the central part of the four-way key. I was offered preset headings instead. All in all, Motorola UI gives the impression of being the least user-friendly of all user interfaces I have worked with so far. On top of that Motorola L7 reacts with significant delays, which back-pedals overall work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>L7 features approximately 6 MB of internal memory extendable by using memory cards of the above mentioned TransFlash type.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where has the megapixel disappeared?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7's camera is definitely the worst elaborated part of the entire device. I do not understand why Motorola has taken a step back by using a low-quality VGA chip in such a luxurious phone. To my opinion, a megapixel would have made the L7 model far more attractive and successful. Anyway, Motorola L7 takes blurred pictures in a maximum resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The phone offers a vertical hand-hold only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display in active camera mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera permits manual adjustment of exposure and white balance. Besides, it is equipped with a night mode, a self-release option and a 4-step digital zoom, which only creates crops. Within the camera application you will find several audio options for the lens shutter. If you prefer not to use sound with the lens shutter, simply deactivate the one that is currently set-up. Bear in mind that just activating the silent mode does not result into automatic muting of the lens shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>               </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from pictures, Motorola L7 also takes short audio-video sequences in 3GP format with a maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. Their length is either half a minute, or is limited by the size of a standard MMS. Shooting does get stopped after 30 seconds, even if the phone disposes of additional free memory. On the other hand, the smaller size of the records permits easy transfer to a PC through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video (3GP, 482 kB)</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A thousand of friends...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7's phonebook does not differ from the phonebooks we have seen in other models of this manufacturer. It fits in up to a thousand contacts. Items saved in the phone's memory and those saved on the SIM card are displayed all together. The phonebook is searched by gradual writing of the name of the respective contact. However, the result won't appear unless you click on "Search". Each contact can be assigned 5 different phone numbers as well as several email addresses, a street address, a birth date, a picture and a specific ringing melody, which is also played when a SMS from the same person is received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;A possible view of the phonebook ? searching the phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone numbers can be organized into groups and dialed by voice. Yet, incoming calls cannot be filtered on a group base. Motorola L7 searches the phonebook really slowly and suffers significant lags. Contacts are searched by gradual writing of the respective name. However, the phonebook does not get ordered automatically and it is necessary to confirm the contact you look for in order that this appears on the display. Motorola L7 is a tri-band phone and thus allows for phone calls in the following three GSM bands: 900/1800/1900 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Modifying contact details ? phonebook options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphone provides loud enough, good-quality sound. The phone also features a loud handsfree function, whose performance is a bit poor though. Ringing profiles are elaborated to the very last detail. There are 6 of them in the menu and they can all be modified according to user's will. The L7 model rings in 24-voice polyphony or plays any available MP3 file instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Typing with iTap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As mentioned earlier, Motorola L7 is not suitable for frequent SMS writing. Nevertheless, it supports all possible message types. The phone features an iTap dictionary to ease SMS writing. However, its dictionary is poorer in comparison with the competitor T9. A SMS can contain a maximum of 450 characters, which is a total of 3 sub-messages. Before a message is sent the editor provides information on the number of parts it will be divided into. Count down starts from 450 and continues in a declining order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu of the message editor ? selecting message type</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be both written and read in 8 lines en bloc. The phone's message capacity is quite extensive due to the shared memory. On the other hand, delivery notification has to be activated each time before message is sent, which is really inconvenient. Any sound saved in the phone memory or on the memory card can be used as an alert sound for incoming SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from standard SMS Motorola L7 also works with EMS and MMS. The MMS editor is similar to the SMS one. A MMS can contain pictures, video, sounds and voice records made with phone's built-in voice recorder. During editing, pictures are directly displayed as previews. MMS size is limited to 100 KB. Besides, Motorola L7 offers an email client, which manages attachments as well as SMTP, POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. Several email accounts can be managed simultaneously, and also both automatically (in accordance with the preset interval) and manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Additional features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7 offers the following organizing functions: calendar, calculator, code memory and alarm clock. There is no task manager or text notes. The calendar offers month, week and day views. Each event can be assigned a description, starting time, duration, repetition option and alerts. The phone can alert you any time before the beginning of the event by any sound available. The calendar permits synchronization with PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Month view at the calendar ? week view ? event detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7 has a total of 5 alarm clocks. They can also be used as "reminders" as each of them permits the insertion of text notes. The alarm clock activates itself when the device is switched off too. Unfortunately, I did not come to find its repetition function. Code memory is located among Java applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting among all entertainment functions is the MP3 player, which is a Java application. Unfortunately, the MP3 player can't be minimized and play in background. Nevertheless, they tracks can be filtered by album and artist name or grouped into playlists. The loud speaker is of pretty good quality. It is a pity, however, that the manufacturer has decided not to include earphones in the original package. This is why I am not able to provide you with details on what the possible qualities of the sound might be with connected earphones. Being a Java application, it is possible to minimize, but such a step results in interruption of the playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Java player cannot be minimized</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is based on Java 2.0 version, which means you should not worry about ever getting short of games. Two games have been pre-installed by the manufacturer. One of them is a variation of the famous Worms; the other one is a classic cosmic shooting game. None of them held my interest for a long time though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Pre-installed games: Rebels ? Crazy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7 provides GPRS Class 10 support. Data transfers are pretty useful for work with WAP browser, in particular. Motorola L7 can also be used as a modem connecting PC to internet. The phone is linked up with PC either through Bluetooth, or via USB cable. There is no infrared port. However, I need to point out that in order to get your Motorola L7 connected to a PC, you will have to obligatory use Motorola Mobile Phone Tools software, which is not available for free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It definitely makes for sentiments<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola L7 is not a phone for everybody. I guess that those of you who pick up a phone by its design will probable be the only ones to appreciate the values of this phone right. Motorola L7 will repay you with an attractive slim design, a brilliant display and a wide range of functions. However at the same time you will have to put up with its delayed response and low-quality camera, as well as with a confusing menu and an unpractical keypad. In this aspect, Motorola L7 is not suitable for users, who need a phone that will be fully reliable in a hectic working environment and particularly not for those of you, who write SMS frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of thinness Motorola L7 has no other competitors but its brothers Motorola V3 Razr and Motorola L6. If you find it hard to decide which one of these three models meets your needs the best, base your final decision on your subjective preferences and the amount of money you are willing to pay. You can also get the new Benq-Siemens S68, which is also slim and user-friendly, but features poorer equipment. Motorola L7 is already available on the market at a price quite reasonable in reference to the phone's rich equipment.</paragraph>
