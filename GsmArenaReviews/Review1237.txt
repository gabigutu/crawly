			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CES 2012 marks the end of Sony Ericsson and the birth of Sony as a leading smartphone maker. The first two Ericsson-free smartphones are the AT&amp;T-bound Xperia ion and the international Xperia S (previously known as Nozomi) and they both look worthy of the occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion is an AT&amp;T exclusive and the first LTE-capable Xperia smartphone. The Xperia S on the other hand is a well familiar gadget - it leaked countless times before under the codename Nozomi. It's the global version of the Xperia ion and while it is based on the same platform, it looks quite different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xperia ion is the bigger of the two gadgets, with a 4.6" HD Reality display (that adds up to about 320ppi), while the Xperia S uses a 4.3-ich display of the same resolution (about 342ppi). Both devices are powered by the Qualcomm MSM8260 Snapdragon - featuring a 1.5GHz dual-core Scorpion processor, Adreno 220 GPU and 1GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is more impressive stuff in the shared DNA - the 12 megapixel Exmor R camera sensor with 1080p video recording as well as the 1.3MP video-call camera with 720p video support. The list continues with 16GB of internal storage, PlayStation certification and Android Gingerbread that should be upgraded to Ice Cream Sandwich soon after launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia S will launch this March, while the Xperia ion is going to hit AT&amp;T network in Q2 this year. The Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich updates are supposed to come by Q2 2012 as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Naturally, the first thing that grabbed our attention when we held the Sony Xperia ion is the 4.6" HD reality display. With its immense pixel density and excellent contrast (at least as far as LCDs go) the HD Bravia screen is quite the looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is obviously not in the race for the thinnest smartphone, but at 10.8mm it's not a brick either. The Xperia ion weighs about 144 grams and feels solid in hand thanks to the high quality combo of glossy and matte plastic and aluminum back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ion is certainly an eye-catching device. The curved lines and the high-quality plastics make it a smartphone you'd be proud to be seen with. However the looks came at the price of some functionality - the ion doesn't have a removable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back is the 12MP Exmor R lens with a single LED flash. We don't have any samples from that just yet, but once we do, you'll be the first to know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ion runs Android Gingerbread, topped with the nice home-backed launcher, just like every Xperia smartphone released last year, but the HD resolution has allowed room for a bit of extra functionality here and there. There's also the dual-core chipset (a first for the Xperia family), which makes the ion buttery smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony promise the Ice Cream Sandwich update will become available soon after the Q2 launch, and we are hoping it's a promise they intend to keep.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We came by the Sony booth at CES to take the other half of the newly announced duo for a spin. The Sony Xperia S is certainly the more important device as it will be made globally available this March.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Previously known as Nozomi and arc HD, the Xperia S will become Sony's first dual-core smartphone and probably the first one to bear the Sony standalone logo. As you should be well aware Sony acquired Ericsson's share in their joint venture company, but the deal is still pending regulatory approval. As you will prbably notice some of the units are branded Sony only, while others still use the old Sony Ericsson logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, Sony is advertising the phone as just Sony Xperia, so let's stick to that for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia S design is completely different from the Xperia ion, but the two are essentially the same smartphone on the inside. The Xperia S utilizes a slightly smaller 4.3-inch Reality display, but it keeps the HD resolution and has a higher pixel-per-inch ratio as a result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we expected, the display quality is as good as on the Xperia ion's and one of the best in the non-AMOLED class. The colors are vibrant, contrast is good and images really come to life on this thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to its slightly more compact body, The Xperia S is even easier to handle than the Xperia ion. That's probably the reason why this time the Power/Lock key is at on its natural top placement rather than the right side like it's on the Xperia ion. The 3.5mm audio jack is right next to the Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is pretty crowded - there are the HDMI port, the thin volume rocker and the two-step camera shutter. The microUSB port is the only occupant on the left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the front. Above the display are the earpiece and the 1.3MP video-call camera, while below the whole HD goodness becomes quite interesting. There are 3 small white dots and just below them is a narrow transparent band with the three Android icons engraved and blue back-lighting. This transparent thing goes the whole way through the phone and you can see right through it. And it's not only a cool design element either - that's actually an antenna, so it's functional too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first we tried taping on those icons on the frame, but as it turned out the actual capacitive controls are those three dots above them. It's awkward and confusing at first, but you quickly get used to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, looking at the Xperia S back, we find the 12 megapixel Exmor R camera sensor, a single LED flash, the loudspeaker grill and the secondary microphone for video recording and noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made of matte plastic and it's quite resistant to fingerprints. In fact, the whole phone (except the screen glass) is made of the same material earning the phone a few bonus points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia S is running on Android Gingerbread and it handles is hassle-free, but we are really hoping that Sony will deliver on its promise to bring Ice Cream Sandwich soon after launch.</paragraph>
