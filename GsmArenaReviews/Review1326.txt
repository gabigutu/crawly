			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Gravity has been a successful line of affordable, slide-out QWERTY messengers for T-Mobile for several years now. With the latest addition to the family, Samsung not only improves the package, but takes it in a whole new direction. Unlike its predecessors, which were feature phones, the new Samsung Gravity SMART, as its name suggests, is an Android smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART is clearly aimed at the first-time smartphone users who are looking for a sensible device, which will deliver an Android experience at an affordable price. It is by no means a Galaxy S II, but it is not priced like one either. It packs a lot of droid functionality in a small, well-built package. Now let?s see what the Gravity SMART has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Samsung Gravity SMART is by no means one of the Android super phones. If you are looking for a high-resolution screen, HD capable camera, and graphic intense gaming, this is not the device for you. Instead, the Gravity SMART is a great messenger and social networking companion with a comfortable keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we know the Samsung Gravity SMART weaknesses, it is time to find whether this little droid can deliver where its strengths are. Hit the next page for the hardware inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Gravity SMART is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read! </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package at the bare minimum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the box of the Gravity SMART, you will find a charger, microUSB cable, as well as an SD adapter for its microSD card (there is a 2GB one included). You also get some T-Mobile/Samsung leaflets. There?s nothing else (a headset would have been nice).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With dimensions of 114 x 59 x 14 mm, and a weight of 130 grams, the Samsung Gravity SMART is on the lighter side of the messenger devices with sliding keyboards. It feels compact to hold in hand and will not slip out of your grip easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at the device (especially in the color of our test unit) will tell you that this is by no means a business device. Its design and color schemes make its youth orientation obvious. In terms of build quality, it feels quite solidly put together. Its soft feel plastic does not hold fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the keyboard in, the Gravity SMART looks like your regular, run-of-the-mill droid. You have four buttons available ? the home screen button dead center and also the Options, Back, and Search buttons. The last three are touch sensitive, not hardware ones. They can cause slight confusion when using the device ? when you swipe across the screen, you can occasionally press them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is nothing memorable but, at this price category, you cannot expect Samsung to put an AMOLED unit in the device. At 320x480 pixels, its resolution will satisfy all your needs. Multi touch is a nice addition which can take your attention away from the screen?s unimpressive resolution. Viewing angles of the unit are far from superb and so is its sunlight legibility. At this price point we can hardly expect a lot. It is also important to note that a lot of high end phones with significantly higher price tags suffer from this issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the screen you will find the device?s earpiece and the proximity sensor (to the right). There is no ambient light sensor or front facing camera on the Gravity SMART.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four row QWERTY keyboard is the key feature of the Samsung Gravity SMART. Its design is rather unique, and its build quality solid. The keys are properly space to avoid accidental presses while you are typing those emails or social network updates. You have two customizable buttons ? one for a social network preference, and the other for a messaging service of your liking. All in all, the keyboard is nothing short of pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Gravity SMART is a home to the volume rocker. On the right side of the device you will find the Sleep/Power key and the microUSB port which is also used for charging the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will find the 3.5mm audio jack on the top of the phone. The bottom of the Gravity houses a tiny mouthpiece and nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn the phone around, you will find a 3.2 megapixel camera with an LED flash, and a loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover is the 1500mAh battery, the hot swappable microSD card and the SIM card slots. In terms of battery use, the phone performed as expected ? it managed more than a day of regular use, but less than two days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART is quite well built for its price range. The QWERTY keyboard is a pleasure to use and, overall, the device is perfectly proportioned and easy to operate.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Froyo and TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART runs Android 2.2.2 Froyo, dressed in Samsung?s own TouchWiz UI. You get four docked icons at the bottom of the home screen, which have become a signature for Samsung, as well as a serious issue of contention with certain competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Gravity SMART UI in action. Check it out below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART supports up to seven homescreen panels, which can host every widget and shortcuts you?ll ever need. However, if you don?t need all seven of them, the unnecessary ones can be deleted. Doing so makes the phone noticeably snappier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the notification bar down reveals the Android notification area. It is majorly overhauled from the stock Android one and holds five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button while on the homescreen lets you add variety of content on it (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same thing), add or delete homescreen panels, change the wallpaper or quickly access the settings menu Live wallpapers are supported as well, but none come preinstalled. There are however many available in the Market. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search and notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Homescreen edit mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By default, the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange icons freely. Icons are shown in a 4x4 grid with a total of 16 icons per menu screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change in the Android 2.2-compatible version of Samsung?s TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently activeapps, it saves you the need to install a task killer. It gives the user details on RAM usage, the amount of free storage and can be accessed through virtually any spot in the UI by holding the home button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve already told you that the Samsung Gravity SMART is no powerhouse of a droid. The device?s benchmarks confirm this fact. We ran a couple of them and here are the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART has an ARMv6 800 MHz processor and 270 MB worth of user available RAM. In a world of dual-core Android, it?s only natural that the Gravity SMART doesn?t exactly top the performance charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in the Samsung Gravity SMART is nothing short of excellent. It has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The contacts application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, in your Google account or in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface has been at work in the phonebook bringing some special features. Instead of just flick-scrolling the list of people in the phonebook, you can search the entries by either typing the name of the person in the search box or by using the alphabet scroll at the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweeping shortcuts are part of the TouchWiz UI and work in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART handled calls great. It held on to signal everywhere we took it and the in-call quality was superb. There were no dropped calls either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names for it. If more than one contact is found, there?s a number and an arrow, which show you the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is situated within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, which can be filtered to show only certain type of events.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The messenger is superb<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a QWERTY messenger droid, the Samsung Gravity SMART features all Android-inherent messaging prowess you?d want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging application itself is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and bellow it are all the received messages organized in threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same swiping functionality found in the phonebook has been integrated here as well. A swipe to the left starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application-specific search lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email can be handled either by the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-Gmail email accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the hardware QWERTY keyboard, you also get a neat SWYPE virtual keyboard preinstalled. This gives you an extra option when typing. The virtual keyboard for example, is quite convenient when you hold the device in one hand ? it is a task which you will not be able to manage with the hardware QWERTY.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android gallery is nice as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART uses the standard Android gallery, which is great. It offers the good functionality, we?re accustomed to, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. Online albums at Picasa show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Facebook Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Minimum functionality video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Samsung Gravity SMART is barely worth mentioning. It covers only the basic 3GP and MP4 formats and doesn?t even have an icon in the menu. The only way to get at it is through the file browser or the gallery. Watching DivX or XviD movies is a no-go with the default video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung Gravity SMART has benefited greatly from the TouchWiz UI. You can sort the music using the sorting options, which are neatly displayed in a tabbed interface. Among the options are current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music experience on the Gravity SMART can be enhanced thanks to the included equalizer in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as usability and looks go the music player on the Gravity SMART is top notch and offers everything from creating playlists to enabling equalizer settings and enjoying an enhanced audio experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is so-so<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART is equipped with a 3.2 MP snapper with autofocus, capable of producing images of 2048x1536 pixels resolution. The camera unit is equipped with LED flash as well. Unfortunately however, a dedicated camera button is missing from the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI of the camera itself is touch-friendly and has great built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes on-screen guidelines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual quality of the photos is good, especially considering that it?s only a 3.2MP snapper. Contrast is good, there?s a pretty decent amount of detail and noise is kept very low. For a messenger phone and a non-camera oriented device, the Gravity SMART takes some great photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording has remained in 2006<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apart from the TouchWiz camcorder UI we can hardly say anything good about the video capturing capabilities of the Gravity SMART. It would?ve been a great handset 5 years ago but today QVGA doesn?t even begin to cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video taken with the camcorder of the Gravity SMART is good for nothing more than an MMS message. Here goes an untouched D1@30fps video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART is worldwide roaming-ready with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 3.6 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity package offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART doesn?t pack much internal memory (150MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can install compatible apps on the SD card though we admit, it might be a hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Gravity hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall any self-respecting smartphone messenger should offer the complete connectivity package and the Gravity SMART delivers on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device. It?s relatively fast, generally bug-free and really easy to use. In the case of the Samsung Gravity SMART, the browser supports flash and multitouch, so it is a breeze to use. The only drawback which we can think of is the low resolution screen of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history. Most visited is self-explanatory and history shows your last visited pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the web browser of the Gravity SMART offers more than acceptable browsing experience for the device?s price range with the only drawback being the relatively low resolution of the display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer makes the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coming to the organizing skills of the Gravity SMART we have almost no complaints. It has a nice preload of apps and those that are missing can be downloaded through the Android Market easily and in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app is very good. It has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. The voice recorder is good too and offers the same usability as on a Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is decent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. But you don?t have the Stopwatch, the Timer and World Clock options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have the notes application on board. It?s great and offers perfect usability. You can store as many notes as you like and even change the color of the note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the organizer package of the Gravity SMART is doing a great job. The only major item missing is an office editor out of the box. This is not really a surprise given the target audience of the device. You are however, welcome to explore the Android Market and find a solution to this minor problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps getting better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART is running on Android version 2.2 (Froyo) so it?s a little behind its family members. The Android Market is where you can download thousands of apps for whatever you can think of and the device will have no problems running them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gravity SMART will run effortlessly just about any app from the Android Market today. The only ones we would not recommend you are the latest graphic intense video games. The phone?s hardware is obviously a limitation which will affect your experience negatively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps is a must<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gravity SMART packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about five minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, including public transportation directions from the latest update, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is not a problem in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps has evolved a lot since it came into being. The latest version offers a nice 3D looking render of the buildings, along with a number of location based search options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a complete package which keeps getting better, Google Maps needs no alternative at the moments. Should you decide that you want to be different, you can explore the Android Market for other options. Just keep in mind that they will be paid and will come short from the Google experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps from T-Mobile and Samsung<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a carrier branded device, the Samsung Gravity SMART comes with several preloaded apps which are worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app for example allows you to stream your Samsung?s content to another device over your Wi-Fi network. Its setup is easy and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lookout is an app which helps you backup your device and protect it from the lately popular malware and spyware attacks on Android. Its most important option however, is helping you locate your precious droid in case it is lost or stolen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you get Wi-Fi calling which has been a T-Mobile staple for some time now. For an additional $10 towards your wireless plan, you can make unlimited calls over a Wi-Fi network. The setup is easy and the potential to save money is huge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After spending significant time with the Samsung Gravity SMART, we came fairly impressed with it. Obviously, it wasn?t the spec sheet or the mind-blowing performance of the device which got to us. It was the fact that it got the job done on most occasions without breaking any sweat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a successor of a family of feature phones, the Gravity SMART is clearly aimed at the people who are about to make the jump to smartphones. Even on a seriously developed market such as the one in the United States, there are still plenty of people who are not familiar with the concept of having a device, which does more than calling and texting. As far as this audience is concerned, the Gravity SMART is bound to succeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of this moment, the Samsung Gravity SMART is free on a two-year contract and costs $249.99 without commitment. Interestingly enough, there are no alternatives with the sliding keyboard form factor in the same price range in the US. We did however, manage to find a few other viable options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Dart is another alternative from within the T-Mobile droid offerings. It is also free on a two-year contract, and costs the same as the Gravity without one. It does have less powerful hardware than the Gravity SMART, along with a missing QWERTY keyboard and a camera flash though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Dart</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus T for T-mobile is another alternative. It is running on a less powerful 600MHz CPU, and lacks the hardware QWERTY, but will still have you covered as far as the rest of the specs go. The Froyo packing budget droid can be yours for free on a contract as well. Without one, it costs the highly acceptable $189.99.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case GSM networks are not your cup of tea, you can check out Samsung Replenish for Sprint Wireless. This eco-droid is powered by a 600MHz CPU and runs Android Froyo as well. Its full QWERTY keyboard has dropped the slide-out form factor and is not as comfortable to work with. You do however, have the option of getting a solar charging battery panel, along with eco-friendly apps to feed your environmental conscience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Replenish</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest arrival to this party is the HTC Status ? the U.S. version of the HTC Chacha. Having just been released, it can give the Samsung Gravity SMART a serious run for its money. The Status runs on the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread, dressed in HTC Sense, and has a serious knack for social networking. Its screen has the same resolution as the unit in the Gravity SMART but, due to its smaller size and higher pixel density, is more of a pleasure to look on. The Status does also have a better 5MP camera unit, along with a front facing one for video calls. It can be yours for $49.99 on a two year contract with AT&amp;T.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Status</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there are quite a few options out there but none of them has quite the same form factor as the Samsung Gravity SMART. The slide-out QWERTY messenger from Samsung shows us clearly that the feature phones are on their way out of the U.S. market. In this aspect, we can clearly look at it as a game changer.</paragraph>
