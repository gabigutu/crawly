			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While other companies were bracing for war at the IFA 2013 expo and lining up their latest phablets, LG was counting down to the G2 launch. The Koreans did a few cool tricks to promote the beast, like shooting the Earth from the stratosphere, but the G2 is an attention grabber even without the expensive PR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G2 is powered by the best mobile chipset available, it has a beautiful big screen with almost no bezel to speak of, and it even runs the latest Android version. But that's not what the LG G2 is going to be known for. No, the G2 will be remembered as one of the few devices to bring true hardware innovation for the first time in many years. While most makers just keep on pushing the number of CPU cores or go overboard with screen size, LG takes a fresh approach to how you interact with a big-screen phone in the most natural way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With high-end smartphones going bigger by the day, the hardware design is struggling to keep up and slowly turning into a disadvantage. The lock key at the top of the HTC One is nearly impossible to reach, volume rockers keep switching sides and places until the moment you start guessing instead of knowing what you are clicking on? And this is just the beginning! How about those lockscreens with unlocking routines, which are getting increasingly weirder?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess we didn't realize how things could've been different until we actually get to see them from a fresh perspective. The LG G2 revolutionizes the Power/Lock key by putting it on the back of the device at the direct disposal of your index finger. You can unlock the screen with just a double tap too. No more finger stretching, using the other hand or doing some magical air gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we are done enjoying the new way of making things happen, we should also say a few words about the spectacular hardware the LG G2 is running on. The smartphone uses a brilliant 5.2" IPS+ display with great colors, contrast, viewing angles and very low reflectiveness. The G2 has the most powerful chipset on the market too - the Snapdragon 800 with a quad-core 2.3GHz Krait 400 processor, Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM. Finally, there is the 13MP camera with optical image stabilizations and full HD videos shot in 60 fps. And these are merely the most obvious things! Here comes the complete list of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wow, what a long list of features! And look at those few alleged flaws - we are already quite used to seeing droids launching without an additional memory slot and with the battery sealed in. Somehow, the manufacturers managed to convince us - users - that we don't actually need to worry about replacing the battery. And while that may be ok for some, the 24GB of inbuilt storage is likely to run out at one point on a device that records 1080p videos at 60 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It remains to be seen whether the performance of the phone in the other departments will make up for that deficiency. Without further ado we drop all introductions and continue with unboxing the LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 comes with the standard set of accessories you'd expect in a smartphone's retail box. The A/C adapter that you need to use with the supplied microUSB cable are joined by a QuadBeat v2 headset. The headset is an in-ear design with flat cabling and a remote. The remote has an answer button, along with volume controls. There are two extra ear tip sets included.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 measures 138.5 x 70.9 x 8.9mm - nearly 2mm taller, a millimeter wider and thicker than the Samsung's current flagship - the Galaxy S4 - though the bigger screen accounts for most of that extra size. The G2 is 13g heavier than the 130g Galaxy S4, however, probably because of its bigger battery and shell.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 design language is pretty much the same as what we already saw in the company's phablet flagship, the LG Optimus G Pro. There are a few notable improvements though - the G2 has an incredibly thin screen bezel and lacks any hardware buttons below the screen. This way LG G2 is probably the smartphone with one of the highest screen-to-front-panel-surface ratios, its IPS display occupying almost the entire front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already talked about the LG G2 footprint and how it's very close to the Samsung's top dog Galaxy S4. We've lined up the two beasts and took a few shots of them together for you to get a size comparison idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G2 is built around a 5.2" True HD-IPS Plus display of 1080p resolution. According to the company, this is the largest a smartphone can get, while still being manageable with one hand. We did try to verify their words and we found there's some truth to them. It's not the most comfortable experience but the G2 can certainly be operated with one hand. The tap-to-unlock feature helps a great deal, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, while the non-removable battery cover is made entirely of glossy plastic, which is nicely textured with a small dot pattern. What's quite unfortunate though, is this is the same pattern as on the Samsung Galaxy S4 back or at least it looks an awful lot like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the glossy material, the G2 back is quite susceptible to fingerprints and smudges and you'll have to clean it regularly if you want to preserve the flagship's proper looks. Or you can just get the white flavor, where all those unpleasant fingerprints are not visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already met both the black and white versions of the G2 at its announcement party in New York in August. The fingerprint prominent surface aside, we still like the white flavor better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the lively and huge IPS display, the G2 front panel accommodates the earpiece, the 2.1 MP secondary camera, capable of 1080p video capture and the proximity sensor. There's also a status LED that lights up in different colors depending on the notification - incoming or missed calls, alarms, calendar reminders, apps, etc. There are various settings for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the LG G2 is completely bare, while the left one offers the lonely micro-SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG G2 houses the secondary mic and the IR emitter for the remote control functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom has the primary microphone, the loudspeaker, the 3.5mm audio jack and the MHL-enabled microUSB port. The G2's connectivity port supports TV-out, USB on-the-go and USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front and rear panels are separated by a very thin silver frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G2's back is where things get interesting. As you could expect, the OIS-packing 13MP camera and the LED flash are here, but all the new hardware controls are around here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware one-piece volume rocker is just below the camera with a Power/Lock key dead center. When the screen is locked a long press on the Volume Up key launches the Quick Memo tool, while a long press on the Volume Down control fires up the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock combo at the volume rocker's center has a LED-lit rim that doubles as a notification LED. Unlike the front notification LED, this one lights up in white only on incoming notifications and when you wake up the screen or call someone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG made a big deal out of the key's location. According to them, it provides for a more secure grip of the phone, it is more intuitive as it's exactly where the index finger usually rests and, finally, it's supposed to reduce the accidental drops, which are common when handling side buttons on big-screen smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really glad to report it's exactly what LG claims to be. The key placement spares you lots of unnecessary finger stretching, the location of all three keys is really convenient but it takes a bit time getting used to it. Finally, it really provides better grip and lowers the chances of accidental phone drops. Someone should have definitely thought of this earlier! This is a great example of how a very simple concept can break the mold and come out as a great innovation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual battery tests on the LG G2 and rated its endurance at the amazing 62 hours. The 3G talk time was pretty impressive - 25 hours, while the video playback and web browsing tests drained the batter after more than 11 hours. Normally with such numbers the endurance rating would have been higher, but a high power drain in standby reduced the final number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the 62 hours endurance rating means your LG G2 will last two and a half days if you use the phone for 1 hours of 3G talks, 1 hour video playback and 1 hour web browsing each day. You can read more details about the G2 battery life over at our blog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling the LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is a solidly built smartphone with a practical design and innovative placement of the hardware controls. It has good looks, though its rear pattern is quite similar to its major rival - the Galaxy S4. One-hand operation with the device is surprisingly possible thanks to the key on the back and the one-hand keyboards LG has provided. Pocketing isn't a problem either, the LG G2 has its slim profile that will fit in almost any pocket or purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The eye-catching 5.2" True HD IPS Plus display of Full HD resolution is definitely one of the LG G2's key selling points. LG is keen on making lots of noise about how the colors are rendered, pitting it against Samsung's AMOLED displays. Long story short, LG claims the G2's display shows 100% accurate colors, unlike AMOLED screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the screen looks like through the eye of our digital microscope:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2 display under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we took it for a test drive ourselves and we can safely confirm that the images indeed look great and colors pop, especially the reds. The display is impressively sharp too, thanks to the amazing pixel density of 424ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the screen junkies that we are, we decided to take out the Galaxy S4 and put its Super AMOLED 1080p screen next to the True HD-IPS+ 1080p LCD of the G2. The direct comparison showed that the Galaxy S4 has better contrast and juicy, oversaturated colors (which is plus or a minus, depending on who you ask).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done great in minimizing the screen's overall reflectiveness and we are glad to share that unlike the Optimus G Pro, the G2 True HD IPS Plus display is quite unreflective when it's on. There is some contrast loss when you are viewing the screen at an angle, but it's minor and won't take away from the otherwise great picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also compared the G2 screen to the Optimus G Pro's, which theoretically uses the same technology. The Optimus G Pro's screen has about the same level of contrast, but it is a bit more reflective and as a result its sunlight legibility is worse.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 flip covers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG will be also offering the cool QuickWindow flip covers, but unlike the Galaxy S4 S Cover, those will wrap around the back instead of replacing it. This is because the LG G2 uses unibody construction and you can't really remove the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name suggests, QuickWindow covers feature a small windows that the G2 nicely utilizes turning it in a "mini phone" within the bigger phone. You can make calls, use the music player, read your messages, check the notifications, all without having to open the cover. LG has also pre-bundled lots of fancy clock skins.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A story of Android 4.2, Optimus UI, Quick Memo and Guest Mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is the company's first smartphone to be powered by Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. Naturally LG's own Optimus UI topping is overhauls the entire OS. The customizations run deep and there's a rich selection of themes, changeable icons and home-brewed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the LG G2 on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user experience is still very similar to the one on the Optimus G Pro, though the latest Android and Optimus UI versions bring a few major features that aren't available on any other LG smartphone yet. LG G2 comes with some cool options like Guest Mode, Slide Aside multitasking, KnockON lock/unlock, lockscreen widgets and more. We'll get to all of them further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since LG has put the Lock/Unlock hardware key at the back of the G2, the company has come up with another idea that will make this key obsolete in case you don't like its positioning. You can wake the screen with a double tap on it. It works flawlessly once you get used to putting a little more force into the knocking compared to how you'd tap if you were actually using the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To lock the phone you don't need to use the hardware key either. You just double tap on an empty area of your homescreen or on the status bar no matter where you are - it will lock your G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool LG lockscreen that lets you peek beneath the lockscreen is onboard. There are five animations for the peek hole type - the familiar dewdrop, ripple, while hole, crystal and the default particle. All of them are really cool and we honestly had a hard time deciding on which effect we like best. You can also place up to five shortcuts on your lockscreen that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen now has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right is special and fires up the camera, but you can easily disable it from the widget menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - four different clocks, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, Quick Remote and Weather you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the multiple account support that premiered with the Android 4.2, LG was able to support the so-called Guest Mode. It's activated by a specific unlock pattern and unlocks the phone in this mode. There is no app drawer in the guest mode - you can access up to five apps in there - camera, video and music players, calculator and quick remote. You can, of course, add more available apps from the list above. If you want to go back to use the phone normally, lock the screen and unlock it with your standard unlock pattern, not the guest one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Guest mode will come in handy if you are handing your phone to a child or you just want to keep your stuff personal from friends, who might like to use your phone for a quick call or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen fits up to 5 shortcuts (including the shortcut to the App Drawer). You don't have to use all available slots though - you can discard all but the App Drawer shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders. In fact, most aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key arrangement and background, lock animation, system fonts, and even the notification light on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get three homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to add more (up to seven) or delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set any of the homescreens as default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front touch buttons are also highly customizable - you can choose their arrangement, you can even add a fourth permanent shortcut for the Quick Memo. You also set black or white background for those keys and choose if that background will be transparent on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-baked tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to use widget-like resizable small apps while using other full-screen apps. The system-wide Quick Memo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize widgets or you can even shrink a widget down to the corresponding app's icon. Also if you move a widget over an occupied slot on the homescreen, the icons underneath immediately move out of the way, which is really neat and comes as part of the original Jelly Bean release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu gives you a quick access to different settings, as well as themes. There are only two themes available on the G2 - the default one and Marshmallow. The latter is more likely to be used by kids than any adult. Unfortunately you can't get more themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned the Q Slide shortcuts that are found in the notification area. They launch pop-up widget-like versions of the video player, web browser, phone, messages, calendar, email, memo, voice recorder, file manager and calculator. In case you don't need some of those shortcuts, you can remove it via the edit key at the end of the shortcut row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q Slide feature is very similar to the Sony's small apps but supports only two windows opened simultaneously. You can resize the mini app whatever you like, there is a dedicated shortcut that'll take you to the full screen app. There is also a transparency scrubber - once you decrease the transparency even by a hair, the mini app is no longer part of the active UI (besides its transparency scrubber) and you can interact with whatever's beneath it (the mini app will continue its work of course, i.e. a video will still be playing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked by LG to let you rearrange the toggle buttons available. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you have a music track playing in the background, quick controls will show up here. You can also swipe notifications to the left or right to dismiss them. Notification expanding is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher (tap on hold on Home) hasn't changed a whole lot since ICS. It shows you all of the currently running apps, which can be swiped left or right to terminate. The task switcher is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button. There, you'll also find a shortcut to Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a shortcut to the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's task manager lists the currently running apps, shows the available RAM and conveniently offers a button to stop all running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of app switching, LG has implemented a new multi-tasking feature called Slide Aside. You can use a three-finger swipe from the right side of the screen to add the app into the Slide Aside UI, while three finger swipes from the left will switch between the running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slide Aside supports up to three apps which get into a sort of frozen state and you can access a preview of all the three apps either form the notification area's dedicated shortcut or via a three-finger swipe to the left on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like this way of multitasking, but it isn't implemented that well on the LG G2. The phone occasionally didn't recognize the swipes and the whole left/right swipes across the screen to open/switch feel quite awkward and hard to remember. Honestly, Apple did a lot better with the app switching gestures on its iPads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer bigger, too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like storage usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed a trick from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Samsung's Smart Stay - called...Smart screen. It uses the front-facing camera to detect whether you're looking at the screen. This means you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartVideo on the other hand will pause a currently playing video when you look away. That's another thing copied over from the Samsung Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called Quick Memo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the LG Optimus G and G Pro. You can save the result as an image or add it to the Notebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch the Quick Memo without unlocking the phone while holding the volume up key. Otherwise you can launch the app pretty much from everywhere from its dedicated shortcut in the notification area or with a swipe up gesture on the Home key. If you enabled the Quick Memo key on the navigation bar, it's probably the easiest way to access this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG brought a new service called Quiet Mode. It works in a similar way to the Do Not Disturb feature on iOS 6 and the Blocking Mode at Samsung's Galaxies. It gives you extra control over the call alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If turned on, Quiet mode will mute incoming calls only. You can set a time frame, when the Quiet mode is activated every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like DnD on iOS 6, Quet mode has an exception list where you can add some contacts that won't be affected by its restrictions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily activate Quiet mode from the dedicated toggle in the Settings menu. When it is on, an icon appears on the far left side of the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature, we didn't notice at first, is the Clip Tray. If you tap and hold on different links, pictures, music and video files, phone numbers or just simple text, then select Add to Clip Tray or Copy to clipboard - they are automatically added to you Clip Tray. Then you can go to messages, emails, browser, etc. and once you choose to use Paste function you'll get access to your Clip Tray items at the bottom of the screen (you must have at least 2 items in your Clip Tray). This way you can easily save various items for later use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is one more new feature we need to discuss - the One-hand operations. We saw this a while ago on the Huawei Ascend Mate. With One hand operations enabled, you can move the screen unlock, dialer, and the keyboard to the left or right of the screen, depending on which hand you are using. It's a handy feature to have on such a relatively big device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G2 flagship is one of the few high-end phones to use the latest (and greatest) Snapdragon 800 chipset. However, at 2.26GHz, its four Krait 400 cores are clocked 100 MHz higher than those of the Sony's Xperia Z Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the higher CPU clock, the LG G2 packs the same Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM. We noticed the LG G2 has 1.81 GB of RAM available, while the Xperia Z Ultra offers 1.76 GB RAM to the Android OS. Because the smartphones share the RAM with the GPU, this means Sony has made 50MB more RAM available to the Adreno 330 than LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough technicalities though, let's put those beasts through the benchmarks and see who wins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We test the single-core performance with the BenchmarkPi. The LG G2 managed to beat the Xperia Z Ultra score, helped by its higher CPU clock.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Linpack is using all four Krait 400 cores. The LG G2 once again did better than the Xperia Z Ultra by a hair.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next benchmark we run is the newly released GeekBench 3. It combines CPU and memory performance but the LG G2 streak came to an end here as it failed to beat the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant evaluates the overall device performance and here LG G2 topped the Xperia Z Ultra by a whisker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's time to test the GPU performance. As we mentioned above, the Xperia Z Ultra offers 50MB more RAM to its Adreno 330 than the G2 and the benchmarks scores confirm Sony's gadget has greater graphic performance. You will hardly ever notice the difference in real life usage though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 330 GPU on both Xperia Z Ultra and LG G2 supports OpenGL ES 3.0, which was recently added to Android (with 4.3) and that promised improved graphics. It's reasonable to expect even better graphics performance once Android 4.3 makes its way to this device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the LG G2 browser is excellent though the Xperia Z Ultra did an even better job. Since SunSpider has recently released a new v1.0.1 we used that for our tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, the LG G2 offers blazing fast performance and user interface experience. There has never been as fast and fluid Android devices as those two beasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG did a great move waiting for Qualcomm to start the mass production of the Snapdragon 800 chipset before outing its flagship. The G2 is definitely faster than the most common version of the Galaxy S4 that is running on the previous generation Snapdragon 600 SoC. You can feel it throughout the whole Android OS, when playing games, even when you are browsing the web. And since the Xperia Z Ultra is a phablet, then the LG G2 is currently the fastest smartphone available on the market to date.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now and Voice Mate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions to the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your use patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by swiping up on any of the on-screen controls and gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work the same route every morning? Google Now will let you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office and will offer an alternative route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you with score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google constantly updates Google Now and in its latest version has become even smarter. If you allow it, the service can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts and friends in the Google+ social network) and what distance you've walked in a particular month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made things faster as it's not dependent on the speed of your data connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in regards to accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Mate, previously known as Q Voice, is LG's answer to Apple's Siri and Samsung's S-Voice. Voice Mate can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, launch apps, change a setting, make memos, add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Mate does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. The problem with Voice Mate is that it is not nearly as fast or as accurate in recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also we couldn't find a way to launch the Voice Mate outside of its shortcut or its pre-defined and non-configurable voice commands (Hello Genie, LG Mobile). But LG did included the Voice Mate into Q Slide UI, so it is also available to launch on top of other apps via this mini apps-like interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the LG G2 is pretty much the standard Jelly Bean affair with Optimus UI goodies sprinkled on top. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. You can navigate the tabs by swipes or, alternatively, touch the specific tab labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favorites on the right and Dial and Call logs on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the usual Android fashion, a tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts shortcuts. You can call the contact, send text or email or view their profile. You can also make a video call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. Once you're there, you can edit the contact info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right corner, while the star icon in the upper right will add them to favorites. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones, additional fields and even add notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new option in the phonebook called VuTalk. Once you register your number through the service you will be able to talk and draw at the same time with another friend who has the VuTalk active. It's a nice feature, but this means your other friend should own an LG smartphone as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 had no trouble holding on to signal (even where signal was poor) and the in-call audio is consistently good and decently loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer is basically a part of the Contacts app and integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab. Again, these tabs are side-swipeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG G2, to find out that it has a very quiet speaker. It scored a below average mark there is a chance you may miss some notifications. The LG G2 though has an option to boost the speaker's volume when you are in a noisy environment, so it gets slightly better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's vibration is really strong, so it might be a good idea to turn it on for incoming notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia to a message is pretty straightforward - just hit the attach button next to the text field and select a number of available options, such as images, videos, voice recording, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the first thing you'll notice is that Google has done away with the bottom bar that hosted buttons for new mail, search, labels, refresh and menu. Three of those have now been moved to the action bar on top and refresh has been integrated into the UI, in the shape of pull to refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing. The keyboard fills up the screen nicely and offers great ergonomics with ample spacing between keys, still leaving enough room above the keyboard for you to see what you're actually typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for one-hand mode, where the keyboard becomes smaller and sticks to the left or right side of the screen. It's invoked by flicking the portrait keyboard sideways and that way you can use it only with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the landscape keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like (LG dubbed it Path keyboard) input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, having the Path keyboard option on will conflict with (and effectively disable) the Split and One Hand keyboard options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting. Furthermore, since this is a Jelly Bean device there's also support for offline voice typing, as long as you have preinstalled the required language packages. We are really pleased with its speed and accuracy, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 uses the same gallery app as the Optimus G and G Pro - in effect, a near stock Adroid gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, Hangouts, MMS, SmartShare, VuTalk, Picasa or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning involves no lag whatsoever on the G2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G2 also looks much like the one inside the Optimus G and the G Pro. The interface is simple, easy to use, but still offers a lot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets and you can even create custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output perfectly clean, but not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 showed nicely clean output in both parts of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got pretty decent scores, but was led down by its volume levels, which were only average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scores stay close to perfect even when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk worsens a bit but the rest of the readings are virtually unaffected (frequency response actually improves a bit). Unfortunately, the volume levels remained just as uninspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G2 has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview feature is back - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a pop-out button at the bottom right corner too, indicating that the app is part of the QSlide functionality on the Optimus UI. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also supports all popular subtitles formats. You can open subtitles manually in case the subtitle file is not using the same name as the video file. Non-Latin subtitles are supported as well and there are the usual options of choosing the font, color, size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with QSlide. In the latest Optimus UI iteration, LG has added a new batch of apps that take advantage of the functionality. Those include the web browser, Memo, Voice recorder, Calendar, Calculator and more. Furthermore, you can launch any of them from the notification drawer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on the LG G2, which can play over a set of headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna). You can also scan for radio stations, and save up to six channel presets. There is RDS support just fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera with optical image stabilization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera on the LG G2 has a 13MP sensor that captures photos with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 and 1080p videos at 60fps. There's also a 2.1MP front-facing camera that, too, shoots 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has been remodeled since the Optimus G Pro, but retains a similar controls layout. You get a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with four shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top shortcut toggles between flash on/off/auto modes, the second one switches between the front and back cameras, the third gives you access to a selection of different camera modes, and the last one is a Settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between one of twelve shooting modes - Normal, Shot and Clear (erases something from a picture), HDR, Panorama, VR Panorama (Photo Sphere shot), Beauty shot, Dual camera shot, Night scene, Sports, Time Catch shot and Intelligent Auto mode, which automatically selects the right scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time catch shot feature (also called Time machine camera) snaps a photo, but also records several photos of what happened before you hit the shutter key. You can save any of the photos on that list that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the photos shot with the LG G2 is excellent. Photos have a lot of fine detail and very little noise. Pixel peepers will notice oversharpening halos, but it's nothing drastic. Colors are very accurate, the white balance is great too. Overall the G2 does some great photos and you can see that for yourselves from the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a few HDR shots as well. Once again the LG G2 does great samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a panorama shot taken with the LG G2. It does the stitching well, but the resolution and the quality are really disappointing. The Galaxy S4 does 60MP panorama shots, while the G2 settles for 5MP!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low-light camera samples looks very good too, though in full resolution you'll notice the drop in the resolved details due to the noise reduction. Despite that, the samples are great in those light conditions and will make for some good pictures once downsized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we took a few shots in the night, but as you can guess there is very little detail in those and are completely useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a shot in a pitch-dark room in order to test the flash. The LG G2 shot a great photo with plenty of detail. We did a few other tests too and we can confirm the G2's flash is great for up to four meters of distance and would do for close-quarter group shots.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera with 1080p@60fps video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the LG G2 is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 1 megapixel of resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few interesting modes available in the camcorder - Normal, Dual-recording, Live Effect and Tracking Zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 can record 1080p videos at 30fps with either camera. It can also record with botch cameras 720p@30fps - that's the Dual recording mode. It looks a lot like video calling with the video feed from one camera filling the screen and the other shown in a small window. You can tap the viewfinder to swap the cameras, even during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p@30fps sample of the dual-recording feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live Effect videos are shot in 480p and alter faces in real time. There are six types of face altering - big and thin eyes, big and small mouth, big nose and squeeze face. We did try all of them and we did snapshots to give you the idea of the quality and the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last mode is Tracking Zoom. This one uses a small resizable and moveable windows which shows you a zoomed area of the video you are shooting. You can move both the zoomed window and the place you are zooming on. We've prepared a short 720p sample (that's the maximum resolution) for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a feature called Audio Zoom. While you are capturing a video you can zoom on a person or an object and the G2 will capture its sound only. The picture zooms with the audio zooming too. We tried this feature but the results were quire disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 main camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at both 60 and 30 fps. The 60fps videos are actually shot in 58fps, but we guess that's the best G2 can do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both videos are stored in MP4 files with a bitrate of 20Mbps for 1080p@30fps mode and 30Mbps for the 1080p@60fps. Audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are some impressive specs on paper and the actual results are great too. The videos are smooth at 30fps and 60fps with great deal of resolved detail, lively colors and excellent contrast. There are no visible defects. Unfortunately, the continuous autofocus is goes off way too often if you are shooting moving objects. The automatic exposure is too sensitive too, though it does a better job. And since there is no way to lock the focus or the AE some videos might get ruined because of that. The LG Optimus 4X HD, Optimus G and Optimus G Pro all had this problems and still LG left the same issue made its way on to the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical stabilization works its magic great and will improve the videos you've shot on the move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this FullHD video sample at 30 fps from the G2. You can also download this sample, taken straight from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepared a 1080p@60fps sample for you. Since there is no online service to support 60fps upload, you must download the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it wasn't for the trigger-happy continuous auto-focus, the LG G2 camcorder would have been the perfect one. Now, it's only great.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In terms of resolved detail, color accuracy and contrast it beats even the Galaxy S4 in good light. In low light, the two are pretty much even.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Complete connectivity package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 comes with a wide range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming, quad-band 3G with HSPA and penta-band 4G LTE for fast mobile Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is plenty fast with dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac. The Wi-Fi capabilities also include Miracast wireless display protocol, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi Hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is a service that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which lets devices connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the eventual demise of Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE support for short-distance connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with support for Android Beam. With NFC Beam you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connections, the LG G2 relies on its SlimPort - a regular microUSB on the outside, but actually a DisplayPort based interface allowing you to output video and sound to an external display (via an adapter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (again, there isn't one in the box). This is probably the only way to expand your storage in case the 23GB of free memory isn't enough for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 has several ways to push out multimedia but it can do more than that - the IR emitter and QRemote app allow it to control your whole multimedia setup, the TV or a projector, the stereo, disc players and set-top boxes and even the air conditioner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple devices to QRemote and organize them by room so it can easily handle your home theater setup, the TVs in all the rooms at home, as well as the office projector and AC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accessible from the lockscreen by tapping the Home key, which saves you a click when you want to use the G2 as a remote. There's no QSlide version of the remote, but you can add it to the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG G2 can replace multiple remotes and media players (Android has apps for practically all the popular movie and TV show streaming services and the Play Store is one of them to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote can be configured to launch automatically when the G2 connects to your home Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom of the G2. LG has added this cool feature called Plug &amp; Pop. Once you plug in a pair of headphones, a pop-up menu with four shortcuts will appear at the bottom of the screen. The default four assigned shortcuts are Music, Videos, YouTube and Phone. You delete those or you can add even more apps from the dedicated Edit button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 features the standard Android browser (with some LG modifications on top), but also comes with Chrome preinstalled so you are given a choice right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard browser offers the typical minimalist interface, with the address bar (used both for typing web addresses and initiating web searches) on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down moves the address bar out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, homepage shortcut as well as new window and bookmarks keys. You can hide that bar by dragging it down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One change in the G2 browser is the button just to the left of the address bar - it puts the browser into QSlide mode, turning it into a floating mini app. You can't switch between tabs in this mode, but the control bar at the bottom is still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser can save pages for offline reading: they go in the Saved section of your bookmarks, and can be accessed even when you're no longer connected to the internet. The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the so-called Capture Plus setting, which allows you to take a screenshot of the whole web page you've opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and share page options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 supports double tap and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text. Text remains legible even at very low zoom levels thanks to the high pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is also available on the G2 out of the box. It doesn't support Flash or QSlide, but it will sync tabs (among other things) with the Chrome browser on your computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G2 comes with the usual set of organizing apps and Polaris Viewer 5 document viewer. Unfortunately, you'll have to pay extra for the document editing version of Polaris Office package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you can view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 could become the essential presenter tool with SmartShare. It can stream content over HDMI (via the SlimPort) or over Wi-Fi (Miracast) and audio over Bluetooth so you can run the presentation from your G2. The app can also push content to compatible LG devices with Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has a split screen interface - the top part is reserved for the monthly calendar and one on the bottom for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar supports QSlide so you can check your schedule while writing an email without having to switch between apps all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape. The G2 is syncable with multiple online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 features an alarm clock application, which lets you set multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time, and ringtone. You can enable application autostartup, so the calendar/email/music player/ tasks/weather app launches when the alarm goes off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a clever feature called puzzle lock, which will make you solve a simple puzzle to disable the alarm. This way you will only be able to stop the ringing when you have properly woken up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator. The calculator is QSlide enabled to be always at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notebook is more advanced and lets you create books with multiple pages, add multimedia, draw and eventually export as PDF and email them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a nice animated weather app that can show you the forecast by the hour, for the next four days week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a QTranslator app, which uses the camera to scan text (a word, line or block at a time) and translate it from one language to another. It's a bit slow and requires a data connection, but it can help you out if you're abroad and don't speak (or read) the language. The OCR (scanning the text) sometimes runs into trouble and produces garbage, but the translations are fairly good by automatic standards - that is to say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 managed to get GPS lock in about a minute from cold start without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has plenty of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find various content and promotions exclusive to LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is not just the company's next flagship. It is LG's hope of getting their best shape back after quite a few uninspiring attempts. And this time around, the stakes are higher than ever as the competition out there is in its top form too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing LG got right is the timing, staying put well after Samsung and HTC unveiled their flagships. This allowed LG to offer the best chipset from Qualcomm, essentially coming up with a 2014 flagship in 2013.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG did not rely solely on the phone's internals to best the competition. The LG G2 comes with one of the best-quality 5"+ 1080p displays available on the market with amazing colors, viewing angles, great brightness and contrast, plus good enough sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the 13MP OIS camera capable of 1080p@60fps video recording. Our samples show the G2 camera quality is on par with the best of the best smartphone cameras in the 13MP range and even though the G2 for some reason can't capture 4K videos, its 1080p optically-stabilized samples are great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done some great work on the design and ergonomics too, introducing the innovative Lock/Volume key at the back. Placing it right under the user's index finger is indeed very clever and we are sure though at first it may look odd, it will be one of the LG G2's best appreciated features. And we really like the double-tap lock/unlock trick too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has been keen to outdo Samsung's TouchWiz for as long as we can remember. And you know what - this time LG might have done exactly that. The new Optimus UI is more coherent and more functional, bringing lots of useful features and services while still managing to stay relatively simple to use. We have always appreciated the variety of themes and icon packs LG has offered but, honestly, nobody above the age of 12 was actually going to use some of those colorful disasters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q Slide mini apps, Quick Memo system-wide feature, Guest Mode, Slide Aside multi-tasking, dual-video-recording, the cool lock/unlock double-tap support, great video player and multimedia capabilities, many organizing skills and connectivity options - those are only part of what the Optimus UI brings to the Android OS. There is just one thing LG needs to fix in the upcoming months - its Android upgrade cycle - and all the bad publicity will come to an end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG G2 has lots of worthy features and is an excellent upgrade of its Optimus G predecessor. The only thing that bothers us is the lack of memory expansion at a time when more and more manufacturers are favoring the return of the microSD card slot. The LG G2 has only 23GB of free storage available to the user. This space will be enough for exactly 100 minutes of 1080@60fps video. But once you've uploaded some music, shot a few pictures and installed a few games, you'll find that there is only enough space for 20 minutes of video at best. What if the G2 was capable of 4K video capturing? Three minutes and you're out?! Someone should better start thinking on these problems or they'll backfire badly within a year or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there is always a way to expand the storage via a USB on-the-go adapter/cable and an external flash drive. It might not be the most comfortable way, but you will still be able to record long videos or carry around enough movies/TV episodes/pictures/music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 might be arriving well into the year but it will surely be among this season's best picks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is currently available in three versions running on Exynos 5 Octa, the widely available Snapdragon 600 and the Snapdragon 800, which is confined to Korea. The latter is rumored to launch in Europe too, but there is nothing official on that. The Galaxy S4 offers a great camera too, though not optically stabilized, it also has a great 5" 1080p Super AMOLED display and comes in a very thin and light shell. It has a few things over the LG G2 - a microSD card slot, a removable battery, a good Android update cycle, and the TouchWiz UI still seems a bit tidier than the Optimus UI. Since the Galaxy S4 has launched last spring, its price has already went down and costs ?100 less than the pre-order price of the LG G2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC has two Snapdragon 600-powered flagships - HTC One and the Butterfly S. Both run on similar hardware, pack the same 4MP UltraPixel cameras and come with front stereo speakers. The HTC One has a 4.7" 1080p display and offers additionally optical image stabilization and an aluminum shell. The Butterfly S on the other hand comes with a bigger 5" 1080p display, 200MHz higher processor clock and a microSD card slot, but lacks the OIS and metallic body. HTC One has already lowered its price down to ?500, while the Butterfly S costs about ?700. Both smartphones are very good at what they do, but the LG G2 still sounds like the better choice to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One ? HTC Butterfly S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has already unveiled its Xperia Z1 upcoming flagship. It's a 5" Snapdragon 800-powered beast with a 20MP camera sensor, water-proof glass unibody and Android 4.3 out of the box. Sony's proprietary launcher is really light, with very few extra features over the vanilla Android OS. We already met with the Triluminos display and we are quite happy with its quality. The Xperia Z1 however is notably larger than the G2 even though it has a smaller screen. And we are yet to see how well the 20MP camera performs. The Xperia Z1's current pre-order price is about ?640 and will launch about the same time as the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no shortage of challengers coming from less likely places like the Oppo Find 5 and Huawei's Ascend D2. All of them have 5" FullHD screens, reasonably powerful processors, high-megapixel cameras and acceptable price tags. The problem with them is that they're not widely available, so you might need to jump through hoops to get them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Oppo Find 5 ? Huawei Ascend D2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day, the LG G2 is a flagship like any other - a great combination of the latest tech, Android OS and a full bag of proprietary software goodies. What makes the difference in the G2 is that it isn't like some of its predecessors - late, irrelevant, and boring. It's a breath of fresh air for the company and we hope it brings some of the LG's glorious days back. Both LG and the G2 deserve it this time.</paragraph>
