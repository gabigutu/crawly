			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The official rollout of the Galaxy S III Jelly Bean update has finally started. In the next few weeks it should land on just about every Exynos-powered S III unit out there, letting it have a taste of the latest and greatest from Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung competitors all reinforced their high-end lineups, so the Galaxy S III needs all the help it can get to fend off the attacks. The timing of this release seems quite great too - none of the Galaxy S III direct rivals has managed to get to Jelly Bean base yet, so the Samsung flagship will have another advantage in this battle for at least a couple of months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the rundown of the novelties that the Jelly Bean update brings to the Samsung Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest question is surely how Flash support is handled with Jelly Bean. Well, if you already have Flash installed on your device, it will stay there. This means that you won't be giving up on anything if you update and that's great news indeed. However, if you didn't purchase your Galaxy S III in time to install the Flash player apk before Adobe pulls it away, you'll still need to side-load it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back when Google announced the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean release, it mostly focused on Project Butter and how it finally makes the platform as smooth as its competitors. However, back then many were wondering if device like the Galaxy S III, which were quite fluid on ICS already, will actually feel the improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later, it turned out that there's far more to the latest Android release - Google Now and offline voice typing are quite nice things to have, while the notification area got even better than before. Yet will those be enough to keep the Galaxy S III competitive? iOS may have basically skipped a turn this year, but Microsoft's WP platform might finally be ready to make an impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's waste no more time and find out - we'll start with the user interface right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Project Butter and TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The so called Project Butter, which raises UI animations' framerate to a consistent 60 fps, is one of the key novelties of Jelly Bean. Yet, Samsung Galaxy S III was always really snappy, so it's not too easy to spot the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there are a few parts of the interface that became even more more fluid. The UI animations are great; opening and scrolling the app drawer, switching between home screens, opening and closing system apps, everything has a tad more natural feel to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Jelly Bean-powered Samsung Galaxy S III in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animations might have looked a bit more "buttery" here, but the visuals of the TouchWiz-ified Android Jelly Bean aren't too different from those of the TouchWiz-covered ICS. Sure, there are a few refreshed icons here and there, but the overall experience is basically unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is probably the most noticeable beneficiary of the Jelly Bean update. It now offers a brightness control scrubber (most Galaxy S III units got this via an OTA update back when they were on ICS, but some regions didn't receive that) just below the connectivity toggles. Furthermore you now get the option to fine tune the brightness of the smartphone fine tune it when auto mode is selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we notice a a big digital clock with the date at the top of the notification area - a minor improvement, but one we found pretty convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there is even more to show off here: individual notifications are now expandable. If you've got an email, for example, the sender and subject will pop up in your notification area and you can expand the entry with a two-finger swipe to reveal the first few lines the email itself. To collapse them again, simply swipe with the opposite move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean Samsung introduces a brand new feature called Home screen mode, which essentially lets you switch between two types of homescreen arrangements - Basic and Easy. Its true purpose is to simplify the interface for first time users, but it can be turned into something far more useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have ever turned on a new Galaxy S III you've already seen Basic mode. This mode is used by default in Samsung droids and gives you the familiar pack of widgets - weather, search, music player and a bunch of shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Easy mode, on the other hand, brings a few new widgets with larger buttons, as well as favorite contacts, favorite apps and a keypad on your home screen. This should allow you to use your Galaxy S III with everything on your home screen and minimal interaction with the app drawer, the notification area and other more "complicated" menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is, you can customize both modes as you please and your Galaxy S III will save the changes. That way you can easily create two different layouts, e.g. work and fun or travel and home and alternate between them quickly. It can easily be used to mimic what HTC offers with their Scene modes within Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we are on the widgets topic, we have to mention their new behavior - they now support automatic resizing and reshuffling. Let's say you are trying to add a new widget on a home screen, but the ones already in place need to be repositioned to make room. With Jelly Bean, they'll do that automatically for you. Also, if the widget you are trying to add is bigger than the available space but supports resize then it will automatically shrink to fit into the free area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jelly Bean update brings a couple of minor changes to the folders on the Galaxy S III. For one you can now tap and hold on your homescreen to create folders, instead of needing to press the context menu key. We also got redesigned folder icons. Honestly, we prefer the old design since we could see mini icons of the first six apps inside, while now we only see the first one properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing the Jelly Bean update brings to the UI is the new Settings menu. It's been reorganized to be easier to find what you're looking for, with the less important stuff being put into a 'More Settings' menu for each category. Three sound toggles have been added within the menu trigger by holding the power/lock key (once again some S III users got an OTA update with these on ICS, but some didn't).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Raw performance under Jelly Bean is quite similar to what we saw when ICS was in charge, although there are minor differences which are still worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First - the Galaxy S III scored better at SunSpider which means the JavaScript performance has been improved a bit. Strangely enough though, the BrowserMark score came out a bit lower, but nothing to hurt the end-user experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III performance in the usual processor benchmark we run - BenchmarkPi and Linpack - barely changed after the Jelly Bean update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the graphics benchmark results came a little lower than before, but that's because Jelly Bean's Project Butter is eating more GPU power. You can't have it all, we guess, but there's still plenty of graphics power remaining for you to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark Egypt 720p offscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning, though - after the Galaxy S III got its Jelly Bean serving the user-available RAM has been increased to 833 MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now is your new best friend<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we said Google Now is one of the most notable new features that the Jelly Bean update brings. In the simplest of terms, it is Android's version of Siri for iOS, but much more integrated into the operating system. Google Now is way quicker than its competitor at recognizing and answering your queries and while its functionality still leaves something to be desired, it seems like a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Galaxy S III gets activated with a press-and-hold of the menu button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own S-Voice service is also on board, and you can activate it with double tap on the Home key as usual. We couldn't find any new features in S-Voice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser may look pretty much the same, but has learned a few cool new tricks after the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its interface has two new functional additions - the previous and next page buttons on the left of the address bar and the brightness setting in the advanced menu. The latter is not browser-specific but gives you access to the global brightness scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As our earlier benchmark confirmed, the browser got some under the hood optimizations too. Its JavaScript performance is better on Jelly Bean, while the HTML5 one stays the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe is no longer supporting Flash on the Android platform and has even removed the Flash app from the Play Store. However if you had the Adobe Flash Player 11 installed on your Galaxy S III - you will keep the Flash support after the Jelly Bean update as well. Unfortunately, if you reset your device you'll lose Flash, and will have to side-load the Jelly Bean-compatible APK that the guys over at XDA-Developers cooked up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oftentimes firmware updates will bring about some camera improvements. However, since the Galaxy S III camera was an excellent performer, we didn't expect to see any major changes, as Samsung was a great job of squeezing most of the performance out of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we were right - there are no camera UI changes, nor are there improvements in the quality of the images or videos taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few sample shots to see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's just a single change in terms of functionality that the Jelly Bean update brings to the Galaxy S III camera. You now get a pause/resume button while video recording, which allows you to create multi-part videos in a single file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compare these two screenshots from the video samples above.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Blocking mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung brought a new service of its own, along with the Jelly Bean update. It's called Blocking mode and works in a similar way to the Do Not Disturb feature on iOS 6. It gives you extra control over the phone's alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If turned on, Blocking mode will mute incoming calls, sound and LED notifications, as well as alarms and times. There are checkboxes where you can choose which notifications to be affected by Blocking mode. You set a time frame, when the Blocking mode is activated every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like DnD on iOS 6, Blocking mode has an exception list where you can add some contacts that won't be affected by its restrictions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily activate Blocking mode from the dedicated toggle in the Settings menu. When it is on, an icon appears on the far left side of the status bar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Offline voice typing premieres with the Jelly Bean update. You can now download language packs (about 20MB per piece) and use voice recognition without an internet connection. This way you are not only saving on your data connection, but the input also operates faster as it's not dependent on network speeds. We were pleased to find out that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another updated feature is to the pop-up video playback feature. It's the awesome trick introduced on the Galaxy S III that brings the video you are currently playing to a small floating window that lies on top of whatever else you currently have open. The new firmware allows you to resize this pop-up window for even further customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app got two new cool features - extra volume and turn on/off noise cancellation - both of which are available only from the in-call screen. You can now boost the volume of the phone earpiece or the loudspeaker even further than the previous maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also select to turn off your noise cancellation if it's affecting your call quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The previously leaked Jelly Bean test ROMs revealed a replacement for the S Memo app called S Note lite. In the final release, however, we were surprised to find Samsung dropped the idea of the S Note lite and returned the S Memo app. As far as we can tell, the features seem to be the same despite some slight differences in the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Easy home screen isn't the only thing Samsung did to help first-time Android or smartphone users feel at home on the Jelly Bean-powered Galaxy S III. The smartphone now also offers a nicely designed help app, which teaches you how to operate its basic features and customize it to your liking. We wish it had a search options, but it still provides a good amount of information for new users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the apps department also brought us some bad news. The Polaris Office app turned out to be incompatible with Jelly Bean and refused to launch after the upgrade. There is no upgrade for it yet, which means that you are left without a document editor or even viewer preinstalled. If handle a lot of documents on your Galaxy S III, then it might be a good idea to seek out another document viewer in the Play Store, and only apply the update if you are sure it works for you. Alternatively, you can just postpone the update until the Polaris Office app get an update, which expands its compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The Polaris Office update is already available in some countries and it should be seeded to all Galaxy S III units in the upcoming days. It seems there's nothing left preventing you from applying the update, then.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also competed our battery test on the Jelly Bean-powered Galaxy S III and we are ready to share the results with you. As it turns out Samsung has managed to squeeze even more endurance out of that 2100 mAh battery pack after the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3G talk time ended up the same as with the ICS-running Galaxy S III and is one of the best performers we have seen. With the screen kept off as per our usual call-testing procedures, the Jelly Bean S III survived for 10 hours and 15 minutes of constant talk on a single charge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browsing hasn?t been a battery-friendly task for the AMOLED phones and the Galaxy S III is no exception. Back in the days when it was running ICS, the Galaxy S III depleted a fully charged battery in 5 hours and 17 minutes, but once it got Jelly Bean, it managed to better that achievement by an hour and 10 minutes. 6 hours and 27 minutes is still some way off the best we have seen, but the progress a single software update brought is downright impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playback is the only place where the Jelly Bean S III falls behind the ICS unit ? the battery reached 10% charger 9 hours and 27 minutes after we started the test ? that?s 34 minutes less than the ICS Galaxy S III managed. We guess the Project Butter is to blame ? the Jelly Bean eats more GPU power than the ICS and that might have affected the results. Still it?s an impressive results compared to most of the smartphones out there and the AMOLED is the one to thank for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major difference comes with the improved standby time. While we are not usually comparing standby times, they are already part of our formula for the final score. So, even with the other results being close to the ICS ones, the standby overall improvement pushes the endurance rating even more higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to see our full comparison charts, head over to our dedicated blog post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S III running on Jelly Beangot an endurance rating of 50 hours (7 hours more than the ICS Galaxy S III), which means you?d need to charge it once every 50 hours if you do an hour of 3G talking, an hour of video playback and an hour of web browsing each day. That's quite an achievement, but keep in mind that your mileage may vary if you have different usage patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no question the Jelly Bean update represents a major step forward for the Galaxy S III. Samsung deserves some credit for not only bringing the update in a timely manner, but also making the transition pretty smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no bugs or newly introduced UI glitches to worry about ? you just get to enjoy the novelties without distractions. You?ll even keep the Flash support if you had that before the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moreover, Samsung continues to include cool new software tricks of its own with the ROMs of its devices. The Blocking mode won't be available to the Galaxy S III rivals even after they get their Jelly Bean serving and we are not that sure about Flash support and pausing when recording video either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The update doesn't really revolutionize the Galaxy S III user experience, but the cool new tricks the smartphone learned help make an already extremely attractive package even better, so the Samsung flagship still finds itself in a great position. Now it will be able to extend its advantage over its quad-core rivals, which are yet to receive the latest version of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III will also have some new weapons in its arsenal to repel the attacks of the newly introduced smartphone heavyweights like the Sony Xperia T and the Motorola RAZR HD. The Jelly Bean update, combined with an appropriate price cut might even help the Galaxy S III win the war against the LG Optimus G quad-core Krait beast, which will be running ICS when it launches. The performance battle is seemingly hopeless there, but the Samsung top dog won't give up on the throne without a fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Samsung has once again raised the bar and it's up to the competition to catch up. The Galaxy S III is now the only Android flagship smartphone to have the Jelly Bean goodies and time works in its favor. Here's hoping though that HTC, Sony and LG don't let this last too long and bring their top dogs up to speed as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
