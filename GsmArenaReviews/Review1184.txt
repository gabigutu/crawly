			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei's charge towards becoming a global brand continues with the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus. Both are sleek metal phones with a powerful chipset and a unique dual-camera setup, the duo is all set to tackle the global flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate 8 is taking on the large phablets with its 6" screen, so it falls to the P9 to battle the 5-inchers - Galaxy S7, LG G5, HTC 10, you name it. Let's play a quick game of "2016 flagship bingo" and see if the Huawei checks all the right boxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that's "off" is the screen resolution - 1080p instead of QHD. Huawei's CEO has long held that QHD is a waste of battery life and he stands by this claim over a year later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's definitely not due to a lack of processing power - Huawei has been building up its chipset brand and the latest HiSilicon Kirin 955 is a proper beast. It combines four Cortex-A72 cores at 2.5GHz (plus four "little" A53 cores) with a Mali-T880 GPU, basically what the Exynos 8890 would have been if Samsung didn't switch to custom "big" cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the LG G5 is in for some company as the Huawei P9 also sports a dual-camera setup and fingerprint reader on the back of its metal unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera was co-designed with Leica, the iconic camera maker, and has a unique setup - two 12MP sensors, one of which shoots in color, the other in Black &amp; White. We'll get into the how and why later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 Plus offers a larger screen for those who have left 5" screens in their rear view mirror. The Plus version brings a 5.5" screen, but switches to AMOLED tech and keeps the 1080p resolution again. It also features the Press Touch technology that was initially restricted to the 128GB version of the Mate S. The bigger chassis brings a bigger battery too, one that charges quickly thanks to dedicated hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 Plus will have to share a room with the Mate S (5.5" AMOLED), but with a much improved camera and chipset the new flagship has little to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the Huawei P9 on the next page and walk up to the P9 Plus after.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei crafted some beautiful handsets for the Mate lineup, but this is the continuation of the industrial design of the P-series. The only major difference is that the camera - and the P9 has a lot of camera - is moved up on a decorative strip at the top of the back instead of sitting on the centerline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is clothed in 2.5D glass and aerospace-class aluminum, which comes in two special forms. The 64GB version of the P9 features the Haze Gold finish, which uses micron-level polishing to create a translucent surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other option is Ceramic White, which Huawei claims is "smoother than the painted bodywork of premium cars." It bends light to create an ever-changing show of color as ambient light changes. Standard colors include Prestige Gold, Rose Gold, Titanium Grey and Mystic Silver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you hold it in your hand the P9 feels impressively light, but the grey version we played with was also rather easy to smudge and become a mess. The screen looks very pleasantly and the whole thing feels very snappy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the cameras is the fingerprint sensor, which protects the phone from illegitimate access. It works like a customizable button as well, you can answer a call or take a photo with it or configure it to work as a navigation button (Back, Home or App switcher).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is a dual-SIM phone with a hybrid slot, giving you a choice between more storage or an extra phone line. It has a single loudspeaker (unlike its bigger sibling).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is where it gets even more interesting - The Huawei P9 camera is loaded with innovation - it was co-designed with Leica and the renowned camera maker helped create something unique.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 features two 12MP sensors, one is fairly standard and captures color photographs while the other is black &amp; white only. It lacks a Bayer filter which is used in color cameras (but reduces the light that reaches the sensor, damaging low-light performance). Leica designed three modes - Standard, Vivid Colors and Smooth Color, which promise to recreate the Leica film camera experience (you even get a Leica shutter sound).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 can also shoot in monochrome. This is true monochrome too, not just desaturated color photos like all other smartphones shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This second camera is used for more than just the occasional dramatic B&amp;W shot, though. It has superior low-light performance, as the lack of an RGB filter on top of the sensor has allowed for an f-stop worth of extra light to be captured for the same scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, both cameras can be used to calculate the distance to objects, which is part of Huawei's Hybrid autofocus (which also includes Laser AF). You can also leverage on the two sensors to create bokeh and other depth-of-field effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei camera app offers manual mode, which offers RAW shooting, manual focus, shutter speed and ISO and a few other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is the first to offer a live bokeh preview (usually, phones render it after the fact, which takes a few seconds). You can still change the focus point after the fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of photos we snapped with the P9 right after the event in relatively good light:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few more we were able to capture a few hours later around London:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 has an 8MP selfie camera, which we also tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the new Kirin 955 chipset retains the flaw of its predecessor - namely, it can't record 4K 2160p video. That's not what you want to hear about a ?600 flagship phone, let alone the ?750 P9 Plus (which shares this limitation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, 1080p is the most you're getting. Here are a few videos we shot during the day (the weather wasn't perfect, but this is London for you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera's low-light prowess also extends to video shooting, here's a video recorded in the evening.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 is powered by an in-house Kirin 955 chipset. Not a full 10 more than the Kirin 950 inside the Mate 8, the designation leads you to believe that not much is changed, and that's indeed the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kirin 955 SoC features an octa-core CPU with four Cortex-A72 cores clocked at up to 2.5GHz (compared to the 2.3GHz of the Kirin 950's), and four Cortex-A53 cores ticking at up to 1.8GHz (same as Kirin 950). The GPU is again a quad-core Mali-T880 MP4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran a few benchmarks on the P9 and the results are in. Oddly enough, the Kirin 955 trails behind the 950 in multi-core CPU performance, as gauged by GeekBench. Where the Mate 8 benches on par with the Galaxy S7, the P9 is a few hundred points behind. That is probably explained by the yet-to-be-finalized software on the review units. We would have also suspected thermal throttling, but the unit remained cool through the test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance is good but not up to the current flagships' standard. There's not much of an improvement over the Mate 8 either, but it's not like a 9% increase in maximum clock rate was ever going to do miracles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Basemark OS II 2.0, the P9 posted a virtually identical result to the Mate 8. Last year's flagships are no match for Huawei's 2016 top model, while the G5 and its Snapdragon 820 are very slightly ahead. The Exynos 8890 Galaxy S7 is another notch up, within an inch of the iPhone 6s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the graphics department where Kirins are often not quite up to par, and seeings as how nothing's changed over the Mate 8 in this respect, benchmark results are very much the same. The P9 is capable of 10fps in GFXBench 3.1 Manhattan in the offscreen test, same as the Mate 8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both also yield a frame a second more when the test is carried out live on the display, and not just rendered in the background. However, the LG G5 and Galaxy S7 can push through onscreen Manhattan at 15fps, despite having to render 78% more pixels, which makers the P9's result all the more unimpressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Basemark X the P9 scores close to 17K points, about a 9% bump compared to the Mate 8. While the improvement is welcome, the the results is nowhere near the best in the business, the Galaxy S7 being capable of nearly twice that. Even last year's Xperia Z5 with a Snapdragon 810 posts substantially better figures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, the Kirin 955 brings a marginal improvement in performance over the Mate 8's Kirin 950 and not necessarily in every respect. The flagship chips from Qualcomm and Samsung will remain undisturbed at the top for the time being.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 Plus hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 Plus grows all the great P9 features into a larger body. The screen here measures 5.5" to complete the twin-size strategy that quite a few smartphone makers employ these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is an AMOLED that features the Press Touch technology, much like the 128GB version of the Mate 8. It enables gestures in the UI: preview photos, zoom, special gestures in games and so on, it can even measure weight. Like other Huaweis, you can use your knuckles for additional gestures (crop and edit images, launch apps from the lockscreen and more).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big P9 has another advantage over its smaller counterpart - stereo speakers on the front. When you hold the phone horizontally, the speakers work as expected, but in portrait mode the top speaker switches to treble while the bottom one plays bass (essentially a two-way speaker).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 Plus comes in two different versions in terms of finish. We handled both and are pleased to report that we like them a lot. The brushed metal units feel silky smooth, reminiscent of the HTC One M9. The Ceramic white version on the other hand might look a bit like plastic from a distance, but it's really great to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another perk is that the selfie camera has been upgraded with autofocus and f/1.9 lens. Oh, and there's an IR blaster on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both P9s run Android 6.0 Marshmallow with EMUI 4.1, slightly updated compared to the Marshmallow + EMUI 4.0 software that the Mate 8 received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader on the back is second-gen (so it's faster) and it doubles as a multi-purpose button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones are powered by the same chipset too, the HiSilicon Kirin 955. Huawei has resolved to use in-house chips as much as possible, but experienced some issues with earlier Kirins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That likely won't be an issue here as the 955 is a refinement of the 950 used in the Mate 8. It has an octa-core processor with four Cortex-A72 cores (2.5GHz, a 0.2GHz bump) and four A53 (1.8GHz). The P9 Plus only comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, unlike the small P9, which also has a 3GB/32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a chance to run a quick benchmark, Basemark X (a graphics test), here's how the P9 Plus stacks up against the competition. Note that this phone is over a month away from launch so the software may not be final.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the power increase, the new chipset still can't record 4K 2160p video. As you can see in the settings, it tops out at 1080p. It does have a ton of Leica features though and full manual controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the P9, the Plus is a dual-SIM phone. It uses a hybrid slot, so you can't have both a second SIM and a microSD, so keep that in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the larger chassis comes a larger battery - 3,400mAh. Unlike the smaller unit, the P9 Plus features Rapid Charge with dual-ICs, which is able to push 6 hours of talk time into the battery in just 10 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P9 will launch on April 16 for ?600 for the 3GB/32GB version and ?650 for the 4GB/64GB. The P9 will launch later, May 20, and cost ?750. The phones wil arrive in the following markets first:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P9 Plus camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We managed to snap a few samples with the Huawei P9 Plus dual 12MP camera. Since the lighting wasn't particularly favorable and the software of the units at the venue wasn't finalized we will reserve judgement for later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we can say at this stage though is that the samples shows plenty of promise and we really hope Huawei is able to extract as much of it as possible by the time a retail units comes to our office for a full review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested the bokeh feature, which allows you to apply selective focus. This is to say it blurs the background, while maintaining your subject in focus for a more dramatic effect. It's a thing that small sensor smartphone cameras have always struggled to achieve, but that can be achieved by leveraging on the two sensors to measure the distances to all objects and the frame and applying selective blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P9 Plus does a decent job - notably better than the HTC One M8, which debuted the feature with its dual camera two years ago. However, things are far from perfect and the edges of objects that should normally stay sharp do get blurred a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the feature is that the phone retains all the info from the two cameras, so you can return to the gallery later on and readjust the focus as you please.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei TalkBand B3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus premiere today, the company also revealed the TalkBand B3 band and we got to spend some time with the refreshed accessory. Just like on its predecessor, the band is passive and is a holder for the Bluetooth earpiece, which sits on top of it. The earpiece itself is the smart part, while the band is merely a stylish way for carrying it around while not using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei touts it to be more ergonomic and has a high-grade chipset resulting in better audio performance, but unfortunately there was no way for us to verify that. We could see the improved design though as the Corning Gorilla Glass-covered curved band really looks better than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bracelet itself is available in three different version - the sporty Active rubber version available in black and white and featuring a simple clasp, the leather Classic (Brown, Gold) with its more stylish buckle and the full metal Elite (Rose Gold).</paragraph>
