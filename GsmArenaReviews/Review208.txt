			<paragraph>Ask not what your phone can do for you. It's Nokia Arte, folks, so the question is who you need to kill to have it. Exquisite materials, sophisticated slider design and state-of-the-art finish are doing their best to camouflage the fact that there isn't much your phone can actually do for you. In geeky terms, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But hey, we never held that against the Arte series. That Arte tag is just a sin tax and there's obviously people out there that can live with it. Cast in the same mold as its forerunners, Nokia Carbon Arte is topping the familiar OLED screen, 3G and 3 megapixel camera with carbon fiber and titanium and 4GB of inbuilt memory. Sounds like we've been there already but a glimpse of Arte is always a treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is the third Nokia handset that comes to fill the gaping chasm between regular fashion phones (LG Black Label series, Samsung co-branded offerings) and out-of-this-world-expensive handsets (read: Vertu and the likes). Dressed to kill and priced to draw blood, Arte is so impressive it's intimidating. Thank goodness it's underpowered enough for many people to use as an excuse. Saves face, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With respect to pricing, Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is practically comparable to its closest kin only - the Nokia 8800 Arte and the 8800 Sapphire Arte. Those have already been around enough for a hefty portion of that limited market to have sealed a deal but someone out there might just be going: "Carbon fiber and titanium? Now, we're talking."</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 8800 Arte &#x2022; Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The concept of upgrading must not be completely alien to even this utterly ungeeky super pricey segment. After all, previous 8800 owners are little likely to suddenly convert to Symbian or Eseries. That's where Carbon Arte comes in, so all of them Luna and Sirocco users don't feel deprived. Forgive that unfortunate choice of words.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, whether it's hammer-over-piggy-bank or conceited rejection, the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is back after the break. Hit the jump for a sneak-peek of the treasure chest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sheer box of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is probably worth a bunch of entry-level Nokia handsets. The number of accessories is noteworthy and they all look the part. Not that any less would have suited the price tag: you doled out for the full package, so it better be full. Apart from the main ingredients - the phone and the battery - there is a whole load of niceties inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, a Bluetooth handsfree is included, instead of a regular wired one. You also get a stylish leather carrying pouch and a paper-weight desktop charger (it's made of metal and weighs a ton and a half). Not that you can't plug the charger cord directly into the phone but this piece of Arte belongs on display. It goes without saying that a microUSB cable and a DC charger are also in the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A huge cleaning cloth is also there to make sure your Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is pampered. The size of a small country, we were almost tempted to use it for dusting our office floor (might as well been the most expensive cleaning ever).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a whole lot of paper and a CD with the required software for syncing you phone with a PC.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte measures 109 x 45.6 x 14.6 mm totaling a volume of 65cc, which is identical to the Nokia 8800 Arte and Sapphire Arte. Actually, size and shape are pretty much set in concrete across the whole 8800 lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 150 g however is an entirely different story. Normally, this is a number, achievable by handsets twice the size of the Carbon Arte but here it stands for something else. That casing is special enough to be measured in troy ounces instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte has virtually the same design as the original Arte and its Sapphire sibling. Go ahead and call it repetitive but respect of traditions is key to fine craftsmanship. Not to mention proof of identity. Carbon fiber on the keypad cover and the rear panel is a nice touch anyway. It seems carbon fiber is the fad in premium handsets recently but we don't find it too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the other Arte siblings, Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte comes in a single color version - Gray. Metallic looks have a distinct charm but we do find the Black color of the original Arte classier even if there's no carbon on its body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of controls on the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte isn't any different from the first two family members. The earpiece is dead center at the top of the front panel. Below it is the 2-inch OLED display, followed by the four main controls (two soft keys, Call and End key) and the D-pad. Those are all on the small side but nothing you cannot live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone is closed the keypad is hidden under a cover made of carbon. Double-tapping on its surface displays a digital or analogue clock on the phone screen. This is quite a convenient way of checking the time without having to unlock the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are very few things to note on either side of the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. The loudspeaker grill is on the right and there is battery cover release button on either side. Even though the camera has autofocus, there's no dedicated shutter key in sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key, which can also be used for switching ringing profiles, is placed at the top of the phone. It is large enough and easy to press even without turning the phone around but is somewhat exposed to accidental presses. This goes true mostly when putting the phone in the carrying pouch. We powered the device off on a couple of occasions, much like with the original Arte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is at the bottom of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte, right next to the mouthpiece. The microUSB is also used for connecting the charger, so there is one less aperture to spoil the fine lines of the Carbon Arte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the phone hosts the 3 megapixel autofocus camera lens. It doesn't have a flash of any kind, so night shots with your Carbon Arte are a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets removed by pressing the two release buttons on the sides of the phone and pulling it down. Under it you will find the 1000 mAh battery, which is supposed to last 300 hours in stand-by or 3 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life has certainly improved compared to the Luna, and especially the Sirocco, and leaves little to be desired. In reality the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte will give you about three to four days of moderate use, which is great for the class. Nokia didn't include a spare battery in the retail package, unlike the Sirocco and the Luna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We probably should say nothing about the build quality of the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. After all, with this kind of handsets one feels entitled to top quality and getting it is no big deal. Having anything to say about the Carbon Arte would've been upsetting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high quality casing is a delight to look at and handle, and weight is more of a bonus here. The sliding mechanism is also perfectly made, and the spring assisted action is spot on. We did happen to find it a bit too harsh in the original Arte but now everything seems fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>OLED Display has stunning picture quality but smallish size<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is equipped with a 2" 16M-color OLED display of QVGA resolution. The OLED technology is superior to LCD as far as picture quality is concerned. Contrast and brightness are incomparably better. OLED displays are also thinner and less power-hungry, which makes their usage in mobile phones all the more reasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are, however, a couple of things bothering us about the display of the Carbon Arte. For one, sunlight legibility is quite discouraging, making the phone near useless outside on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second problem is the 2-inch diagonal which we find inadequate on even midrange phones. The high cost of OLED screens at this stage was hardly the problem here and we can't help ourselves but regret the choice Nokia made with the Arte series display size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is rather good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is much to our taste, with decently-sized keys and terraced layout. Typing would've been perfect save for the inadequate room for the top (or bottom depending on your typing manner) row of buttons. The slider simply doesn't open enough to allow the those rows of keys to be used effortlessly. Having in mind though, that Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is hardly targeting heavy texters, its keypad is more than acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the phone is also top notch: strong and even, it makes the phone look as good in the dark as in bright daylight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Series 40, 5th edition is no news anymore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you expected miracles from Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte software department you will probably end up disappointed. It is perfectly identical to the original Arte and that's why this software part of the review might be familiar to you if you have been keeping track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen displays the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the labels of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn active standby on. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated to suit the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom events from the calendar are displayed set for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear simultaneously, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icons grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons of the main menu can be freely reordered to suit the user's taste. An interesting thing to note here is that the Opera Mini browser, the calculator and the WidSets application can be found directly in the main menu. They are also featured in the applications folder so, basically, you can access them from wherever you prefer. Probably these three were considered important enough to place in the main menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will even be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keypad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. This is the case with basically any S40 device nowadays and we wouldn't expect any less from the Carbon Arte. Also, there were no halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of themes available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Heavy on looks inside out, the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte comes with six preinstalled themes. All of them are quite up to the task with their conservative styling. You can of course download additional themes, which are available all over the internet. There are even some that produce sounds on certain events, such as opening or closing the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are as many as five predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte, plus a Flight mode, which turns off all transceivers on the device. That number should be enough to have you covered in practically any circumstances. The flight mode can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3 player and it can be used without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte offers space for up to 2000 contacts and extensive configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. Also, first names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and only take a small part of it when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also vary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing. Contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another praiseworthy application is the voice dial, which requires no pre-recording of the commands and phonebook names. It is even equipped with a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony - nothing to complain of<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and call quality are in line with the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte high standing. Calls are loud and clear on both ends eliminating any possible obstacles to communication. After all a handset like the Carbon Arte is mainly intended to be used for making calls so any compromise in this area would be a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, many can consider the lack of video calls a real disappointment. It feels that the 3G support is not used to the maximum. Not that video calling is something we cannot live without but it sure wouldn't hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is the turn-to-mute functionality. It allows muting an incoming phone call or an alarm by simply flipping the device over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It surely doesn't have the loudest voice around but there aren't many occasions you will miss a call with the Carbon Arte. You can find more info about the test itself, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is a real treat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Message menu of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is organized almost perfectly. The handset is capable of handling practically any type of message - SMS, EMS, MMS and e-mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three types share an editor and all you need to convert an SMS to an EMS or MMS is apply text formatting or insert any multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to set a contact as favorite for messaging in case you have frequent correspondence with one and the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB. The best part is that the phone will automatically scale down pictures for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really good stuff. It automatically adjusts its settings once you enter your email address and than all you need to do is enter your username and password. No more time wasted on trying to get a long list of settings right for the client to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Outgoing attachments are not limited in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client downloads the headers and then offers to download the entire body of the messages you need. You can also set the messages to be automatically downloaded in full if traffic is no problem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is identical to the one found in Nokia 7900 Prism. Looks have improved over the 6500 classic for example, but all remains unchanged featurewise. The music player sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The great advantage over the other Arte siblings is the boosted inbuilt storage of 4 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player looks can be changed to the classic skin if that suits the user better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset uses the microUSB jack for connecting a headset, so finding a set of headphones for listening to music may just turn out very hard. Anyway, you can always use the Bluetooth handsfree for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience of the player is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte has only one loudspeaker located on the side, right next to the camera. We did already mention that we weren't impressed by its performance at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, we have to mention that it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no FM radio on Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte, which the Luna for example used to have. So if you get bored with the music player all you can do is turn the video on. The video player is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and generally improves video watching.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery needs improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models. The fact that it also acts as a file manager somewhat hurts its user-friendliness and looks. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest thing around and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter however offers very limited options, but considering the fact that there are very few users that actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter can be quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders. Nonetheless, the gallery on Series 40 devices could be improved a lot. That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery of these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive 3 megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with autofocus. It may not be the most impressive in terms of specs, but is surely the best among the Nokia premium mobiles. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are few, but that makes them simpler and easier to use. The settings include white balance, three photo quality options going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily, as mentioned, there is no flash on the device, which makes photos in low light conditions unusable. Even in good conditions the photo quality is not be on par with the best 3 megapixel cameraphones such as the Sony Ericsson K810. In general the detail is high, but the colors are oversaturated and the noise levels are high not only in the shadow areas, but in the well lit ones too. Just look at the skies from the samples below and you will get the idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two letdowns about the camera that are not directly related to picture quality. The first is the absence of lens cover. The Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte camera only relies on the fact that it is a tad sunk in the surface to avoid scratches. We don't find that enough for such a phone but the Nokia R&amp;D team probably though that lens protection would ruin the design. Anyway, this is maybe the best reason to carry your phone around in the leather case that comes in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated camera button is another real disappointment when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable, especially when shooting in landscape mode, to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose. Besides, the function of the capture key changes to delete once a photo is taken which we don't quite understand. Although erasing a photo by accident is very unlikely, as confirmation is still required, we can't help wishing the Nokia designers did better here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally a few words about the camera speed. Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is about as fast as the senior member of the prism family - the Nokia 7900. This means that it's a decent performer and it won't take ages to take a photo. Still, don't expect it to be as quick as the Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot phones. After all, the Carbon Arte doesn't presume to be a cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte also manages video recording. It can capture videos in VGA resolution. The frame rate is only 15fps and that is quite a downer, plus we already saw the way more modest 3600 slide do exactly that. Nevertheless, on most occasions videos turn out nice. The videos are captured in 3GP format and their length is only limited by the free memory available. All in all, the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte offers a very good performance for a non-cameraphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - 3G is welcome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is decently covered in Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. The main focus here is USB and it is really seamless. Upon USB pairing you're prompted to select the connection mode. You can then alternate the modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile, which allows stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious absentees here are the memory card slot, which is sometimes the most convenient way of transferring information, Wi-Fi and the Infrared port.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers: Opera Mini is our browser of choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte has two Web browsers straight out-of-the-box. The well-known S40 integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages, has no significant changes in functionality and is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia Luna. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set to the smallest font, the display fits up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browsing experience with this application however is nowhere near the standard of Nokia smartphone browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser faces serious competition from a brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java app. The latter is preinstalled and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. Besides, Nokia seem to share this point of view as they have placed a shortcut to Opera Mini right inside the Main menu, facilitating access to the browser. Opera Mini is by far the more intuitive application, fitting text better than the integrated browser. If only the screen was a little bigger web-surfing would have probably been absolutely great with the Carbon Arte.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has stood the test of time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte has undergone very little changes compared to the other S40 models. Not that it needs many, as it is handling time-management almost perfectly. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are also five types of events available for setting up: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own unique fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize you tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length limit is 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. A nice touch to it is the possibility to set snooze time to any interval you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, there is a cool feature utilizing the built-in sensor that shows the clock when you shake the phone twice. It also works upon tapping the keypad cover twice if you prefer it this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking. This time however, the calculator offers two different versions - a basic application and a scientific version with more functions available. An elaborate loan calculator is also at the user's disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte has a decent set of preinstalled applications outside the organizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First in line is the size converter that provides quick conversions across various size standards. From shoes to shirts, everything is covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there goes the unit converter. It offers all kinds of converting options, including currencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search application helps you find the piece of data you are looking for on you handset, while the download application takes you to the Nokia download center. There you are going to find a lot of useful stuff for your handset. The WidSets application is also aboard the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte. It represents a group of web based applications that can be accessed at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a dictionary, which offers quick multilingual translations. Unfortunately, the word database is not that big, so don't expect too much of it. The world clock application that can tell you the current time in every spot of the world completes the list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only one game is available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably feel disappointed with the Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte preloaded content. It features a single game - Golf Tour. Although it has acceptable graphics and decent gameplay, we aren't quite impressed. Besides, we have seen it on dozens of handsets already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it is hard to imagine a Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte owner fooling around playing games on their mobile. Now, even this design-centered device can be turned into a portable gaming console with the dozens of compatible games available for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You have probably made up your mind by now about buying the 8800 Carbon Arte or not, and there is little we can say to change it. One thing is for sure - budget and Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte just don't rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The looks and the feel of this phone are awesome and you can bet attention has been paid to every detail. Even if you tried really hard there is barely a thing you can complain about as far as design and construction is concerned. We doubt it tech-freaks will get a kick of those sleek curves but they were never meant to be the target of Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage Nokia is the unchallenged sovereign of this niche. And they can do whatever they want as it seems - even if it's replicating the same design and swapping one piece of exotic material for the next. In the premium segment it's a different set of rules. We're talking a market where upgrading from Sirocco to Arte may as well be considered bad taste. Owning the complete set is more like it.</paragraph>
