			<paragraph>Back when the driving seat was shared with Ericsson, Sony was a little short of delivering a real winner in the high-end market, the company's top-range smartphones always a notch below the Galaxy S lineup and their HTC counterparts. Now on their own, Sony cannot shy away from the toughest of battles and the Sony Xperia T is ready to be thrown in the fire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A true flagship, the Sony Xperia T comes properly powered by a Snapdragon S4 chipset, boasting a class-leading 13MP camera and a marvelously sounding 720p display. There's no quad-core on its resume, but the Xperia T is ready to take on the best Android offerings out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T hasn't got the raw muscle of some of its rivals, but there's enough to get you interested. And once you go and give it a try, the design and handling will hardly let you down. In a smartphone market as crowded as today's, handsets with this much character are hard to come by. Now, a grateful nod is well in order to old allies and the Xperia Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting record benchmark scores is one thing, but having an excellent chipset in a body that's great to look at is to many a more than even tradeoff. The Sony Xperia T should not be afraid of facing its rivals in a raw processing power battle, though it's the beauty contests it enjoys the most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then there's the software enhancements, to which Sony paid more than enough attention. The Android ICS on the Xperia T comes with a great-looking UI, which Sony claims is also one of the most functional around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get going then - the unboxing and hardware checkup are this short jump away.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package brings no surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T comes in a compact retail box, which holds nothing but the essential accessories. There's a microUSB cable to be used for charging and data connections, as well as a standard mains charger if that's how you prefer to fill up your smartphone's battery. A pair of headphones is supplied too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card provided, but the Xperia T offers adequate storage out of the box. As usual, you'll also have to purchase USB-OTG and MHL adapters separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia T 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T measures 129.4 x 67.3 x 9.4 mm, which is more than reasonable for a device with a screen this big. Provided the on-screen keys don't require extra space on the front panel, the size of the Xperia T is no great feat. Still, the new Sony flagship is still nearly half a centimeter shorter and a couple millimeters narrower than the Motorola Atrix HD, which has an identically sized screen and, again, on-screen controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T has a rather distinct design, for which it is clearly indebted to the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc. The difference between the slimmest and the thickest part of the device is not as prominent here and we happen to like it better this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of materials is quite good too, the rubberized back feeling nice to the touch and looking quite durable. The sides of the Sony Xperia T are nicely sculpted for a good grip even at their thinnest and the tapered top and bottom are perfectly complementing the phone's arched shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The space at the top of the front panel is quite well used, the actual screen surface reaching nearly all the way to the edge, only leaving enough room for the earpiece and the front camera. Things aren't as impressive at the bottom, where the Xperia logo is surrounded by lots of unused space. Had Sony taken a similar approach here the Xperia T design would have become an even more impressive feat of engineering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Sony Xperia T features the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom we find nothing but the main microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unprotected microUSB port is located on the left side of the Sony Xperia T. There's no port cover to get in the way of quick connections, but that leaves you with another hole on the handset's body, which is hardly ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite side is quite crowded, featuring three controls (from top to bottom: power/lock button, volume rocker and shutter key) and a thin plastic flap behind which reside the microSD slot and the microSIM card compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key and power button are a bit too tiny and need getting used to, but they started working out for us eventually. What we didn't quite like is the flap over the two card slots, which once opened is really hard to properly close. Gaps usually remain, which not only invite dust and dirt, but also make the Xperia T look as if it wasn't assembled properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our tour around the Sony Xperia T controls at the back, where the 13 megapixel camera lens is the star of the show. There's an LED flash by its side to assist low-light performance and act as a flashlight. The loudspeaker grille is centrally placed at the bottom of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a subtle bulge around the camera and the smartphone rests on it, but the actual lens is reasonably protected against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Sony Xperia T is non-removable and you have no access to the 1850 mAh battery underneath. The capacity sounds rather modest, so the option to carry a spare would have been handy, but you can still bring one of those external battery packs and a cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery itself is rated at up to 7 h of talk time and 410 h of 3G stand-by (450 h in 2G). Those are hardly the most impressive numbers around, but the Sony Xperia T still did reasonably well in our dedicated battery test. It got a rating of 36 h, which means that you'll only need to charge it once every 36 hours if you use it for an hour of talking, web-browsing and video watching per day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The largest Bravia screen in the business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T comes with a 4.55" LCD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels which breaks down to a pixel density of 323 ppi. That's a respectable number and the real-life performance doesn't let you down. The Bravia-powered screen is as sharp as it gets and you'll be unable to tell individual pixels apart even if you look from up close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is pretty good for an LCD and colors are very vibrant. The sunlight legibility is quite good as well, as testified by the Xperia T's result in our dedicated test. Find more about the testing routine over here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Sony is yet to address the issue of poor viewing angles. You really need to be looking at the Xperia T head-on to experience arguably the best image quality from an LCD, as once you tilt the phone even a tiny bit, the image quality deteriorates noticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were also able to put the display under our digital microscope for a closer look at the pixels. Check it out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The display under a microscope</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T handles pretty well, despite its higher-than-average thickness. The curved back helps and so do the two-layered sides. The only issue we see is the power button which is located too low on the right side of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That position is actually quite comfortable if you are holding the Xperia T in your left hand, but right-handed use requires you to readjust your grip whenever you want to press the power key. Last time we checked right-handed users were the majority, so it's strange that Sony didn't put that button higher or at least on the other side of the smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Optimized Xperia UI on Ice Cream Sandwich<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of box but Sony is promising an update to Jelly Bean. On top of Android runs the custom Sony launcher, so the interface doesn't feel too different from what Sony users are used to. This isn't the first time we've seen ICS on a Sony device either, but this time it seems that Sony have put together an excellent software package. It has enough of the traditional Android UI so you won't feel lost, as well as a couple of new features that might raise a few eyebrows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a brief video tour of the interface to give you an idea:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T has the usual five-pane homescreen configuration, but there is no option to add or remove panes. Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. For folders, you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with older Sony smartphones, you can change the color theme of the launcher according to your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode, which lets you quickly find a widget across any of your homescreen panes. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up showing all active widgets for easy viewing and selection. Tapping on a widget takes you directly to the homescreen that it is on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, but the Album gallery is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing on an empty area of a homescreen opens up a small contextual menu under the status bar. It gives you two options - choosing a widget and choosing a wallpaper/theme. It's oddly placed and easy to miss at first because the animation is so understated it looks as if nothing has happened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving and removing widgets hasn't changed and is as simple as on droids of old - hold a finger over a desired widget and move it around. The action has a cool wobble animation to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new addition to the lockscreen, missing from the Xperia phones of old, is the Walkman widget which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and features a few added connectivity toggles. There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. For some reason, the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen as it usually is on other ICS-running Xperia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a brand new task manager, which still lets you go to open apps as well as remove them with a side-swipe, but also introduces something we haven't seen in Sony ICS before, and that's 'small apps'. They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a part of the ICS platform you get the Data usage app. Sony provided one on Gingerbread as well, but this one is far more accurate in calculating your traffic. It also lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android ICS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, restoring them with the previous saved settings. The reset option is in the same submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has made a lot of improvements to its ICS build - like the notification area toggles, but it's still missing a few extras that are some that other OEMs are opting for. For example, Samsung has a Remove all feature when you open the task switcher, and most Android UI's let you adjust the number of homescreen panes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8260A Snapdragon chipset, which packs two 1.5 GHz Krait cores and 1 GB of RAM and an Adreno 225 GPU. Altogether a pretty solid configuration, and we're eager to see how it stands up against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We begin with the Quadrant benchmark where the Xperia T did its best against mostly quad-core competition. We got slightly worse results here than what we got from the device when we tested it at its unveiling at the IFA trade show a few months back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi shows just about the same numbers we saw at IFA. The just-announced Motorola DROID RAZR M houses the same 1.5 GHz Krait as the Xperia T, so it's no surprise that these two devices top our standings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This trend continues with Linpack, though neither device was able to surpass the (Krait-powered) HTC One S. Nevertheless, the results at the top of the pack are very close.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 is a CPU and memory benchmark that is optimized for multi-core environments. Again, the Xperia T couldn't get away from some tough quad-core competition, but still managed to do well for a dual-core.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark tests GPU performance in a graphics stress test. While the superiority of quad-core devices in graphics performance really came to light, the 55 fps the Xperia T scored is certainly not a bad result, especially considering the HD resolution it has to deal with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.1 Egypt (offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript browser performance tests tell a slightly different story, however, as the Xperia T found itself right around midtable in both SunSpider and BrowserMark. We expect scores to improve slightly with an eventual Jelly Bean update, which is a performance boost for the Android browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the exception of graphics performance and web browsing, the Sony Xperia T showed some truly great numbers. We were worried that the choice of a dual-core device to headline the Xperia lineup was going to spell trouble for Sony when comparing the T to other flagships, but the dual-core Krait really flies. Still, if you demand the best 3D mobile gaming performance, there are better devices available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T phonebook looks slightly different from what we're used to in ICS. The bottom bar no longer shows you shortcuts to phone, favorites, contacts, and is now a search and add number field. The contacts, phone, favorites and groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia T was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia T automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia T, and the results were far from good. Scoring a Below Average result even with xLOUD turned on, the Xperia T is a definite disappointment in terms of speakerphone loudness. More info on our loudspeaker test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is business as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layouts. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also get a quick overview of your Twitter and Facebook feeds using the integrated Timescape app. Your feeds show up in a flowing vertical carousel that is very quick and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia T offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The brand new gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T comes with a new Sony Ice Cream Sandwich gallery, called Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with cool animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New video player includes powerful editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded - although it identified our version of The Mask not as the famous Jim Carrey flick, but rather a horror movie from 1961 by the same name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T did a very good job with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD. The only glaring exception was videos with AC3 audio, where we got no sound, although the video still ran fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video editing app called Movie Studio is bundled too. It lets you edit video, images, and audio together (both imported from files as well as recorded/taken by the device itself), using a variety of cool transitions. You can then export the resulting project into a video file that you can share using the T's generous connectivity features (more on this below).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another of the redesigned Sony media apps which has gotten a facelift is the new Walkman music player. It retains all the functionality of the older music players but adds a little bit extra here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is divided into Playing and My music panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Walkman player offers support for customizable equalizer settings, giving die-hard audiophiles the chance to fiddle around with the individual EQ bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the rest of the music player is the same as what we saw on Sony Ericsson handset, this one adds music controls to the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and adds bookmarks to stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decently clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T performed pretty well in the first part of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got very good scores all over and garnished them with average volume levels, making up for one of the good performances we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but things certainly aren't too bad. The stereo crosstalk rises and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels remain about the same, though, which is not a common sight among smartphones. A solid overall performance, which should please anyone but the most demanding audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP Camera comes with its own interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T boasts a 13 megapixel camera with a back-illuminated Exmor R sensor and a single LED flash. It's capable of producing stills of 4128 x 3096px resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia T are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up two pages of extra settings - scenes, resolution, smile detection, geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode among others. You can customize three of the shortcuts on the left (the shooting mode shortcut is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three capture modes to choose from: Normal, Auto Scene recognition, and Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia T take a guess (it's fairly good at it). Sweep panorama mode lets you take a panoramic shot by sliding your camera in a line from left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T features a Quick launch option, which lets you customize the phone's behavior upon a press of the camera key when the phone is locked. The default option is Launch and capture - it unlocks the phone, starts the camera and instantly snaps a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to frame the first shot right from this mode, but you can quickly take another photo as the camera reloads quite fast. The other option is to just unlock the phone and start the camera, or you can just disable this feature altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13 MP camera sensor on the Xperia T produced stills which were for the most part good, with the notable exception of some serious overexposure issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the most part, this was limited to scenarios where objects in the frame reflected direct sunlight, which resulted in loss of detail and inaccurate color reproduction. Individual channel clipping was also a prevalent issue, as in many cases the red end of the spectrum was severely blown out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To better illustrate the poor metering, we've included two sets of samples. This first series is taken at the default exposure value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This second series is taken with the exposure reduced by 2/3 of a stop. As you can see, the resulting samples feature more detail and less highlight clipping, particularly in brighter environments, which proves the camera exposure metering is flawed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the camera features a good dynamic range, and excellent macro capabilities. Colors come out good and there's plenty of detail available. The Xperia T might not be the be-all and end-all of smartphone cameras, but it's certainly one of the better cameraphones we've seen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since there aren't many 13 MP camera sensors out there, we're going to compare the Xperia T to two 12 MP cameras, one belonging to the Nokia N8, the other to the T's predecessor, the Xperia S. Feel free to choose any other adversaries you wish - the tool's page will give you all the information on how to do that and what to watch out for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording could be better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T captures 1080p video at 30 fps, currently the standard for high-end droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera, including focus mode, metering, exposure value, image stabilization and so on. The layout of the shortcuts can be customized here, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T camcorder features continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeatedly attempting to lock focus and ruining your video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FullHD videos are stored in MP4 format (20Mbps bitrate) and the frame is very stable at just below the 30fps mark. The Xperia T videos come with stereo sound recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling - all pointing to slightly superior video recording compared to the Xperia S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample captured with the Sony Xperia T:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>During video recording we see the same issue as with still images - notable tendency towards overexposure. This leads to loss of detail, and since the videos shot with the Xperia T aren't that good to begin with you are left with pretty mediocre footage. Here's another video with the exposure adjusted by -0.7EV, where you don't see as much highlights clipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the amount of resolved detail remains uninspiring and even though colors are decent, we wouldn't call the videos worthy of a flagship. Here's hoping that Sony does something about it with some of its next firmware updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download the samples as taken straight off the device. Here's the first video with default exposure settings, and the second video with the exposure set -0.7.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-fledged connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T has quad-band 2G and pentaband 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds are an impressive 42.2 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 3.1 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and connecting to your PC and there's also USB On-the-go support so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia T but you can get it through the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T also comes with NFC connectivity, although it's easy to overlook considering there are no included NFC tags in the retail package (like with other NFC-enabled Xperia models), and the Xperia SmartTags app used to manage them is also not present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Connected Devices app that also lets you manage DLNA connectivity with the Xperia T. You can either browse content on other DLNA-enabled devices on the same WiFi network, or set the T as a media server for other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T also comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you have an Xperia tablet, Xperia link is a simple app that lets you share the internet connection from your phone to your tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The ICS browser is great as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalistic: all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut and contextual menu. The bar automatically disappears as you start scrolling down a page. To make it reappear again, simply scroll up. The contextual menu gives you more browsing options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu offers extra options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart: when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is the ability to open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available as a Google Labs extra) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. These really go a long way in improving the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes in a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as Flash support is concerned, only certain Flash-related ads will pop-up, while YouTube videos will open in their own app once selected and, as expected, flash games are a no-go. The Adobe Flash Player app has been omitted from the Google Play store, so if you don't side-load it from somewhere else, the browser will only be able to handle HTML 5 videos out of box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also opt for the much-improved Google Chrome web browser, which has also been pre-installed. It's very smooth and it's actually the default web browser on Android Jelly Bean. The interface is pretty simple - you get a combined URL and search bar at the top. To the right of it there's a tab switcher button with the number of open tabs on it. Hitting the menu button reveals options like new tab, bookmarks, look at closed tabs on other devices, request desktop site, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between tabs you just swipe to the left or right to move between various open pages. In the tab interface you can also swipe away tabs you don't want anymore, except this time with a cooler animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome offers full synchronization with your Google account. Just type it in and it will immediately connect to all of your devices with Chrome installed. The only thing that doesn't get synced is your passwords.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T comes with the OfficeSuite 6 viewer. OfficeSuite 6 allows you to view almost any type of document, although you'll have to fork over for the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia T. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also an option for Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver app helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and you can expand it to include advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store is full of free apps that will cater to all your organizational needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot is also part of the Sony Xperia T package, with a navigation license for 30-days and downloadable maps for offline navigation. You need to pay extra to continue using the app once the trial has expired, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store now has books too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android ICS, the Xperia T has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently announced ebooks now being available from Google Play. Play Books gives us the first official Android ebook reader app, and it's pretty impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Play Books comes with several book preloaded, which can be browsed in a 3D carousel view (by default). There's page transition animation similar to the one in the iOS reader, and you can adjust things like font style, size, and alignment, as well as background brightness and line height. You can also view the pages as they were originally formatted in the book, rather than optimized for viewing on a screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T is by all means an impressive phone. The dual-core Krait does a great job of competing with many other flagships not only on its home turf, but in the quad-core arena as well. Add to that a display that pushes out an impressive amount of pixels without issue, and a streamlined Android ICS interface that introduces some nifty features and optimizations not offered by other OEMs, you have a package that is very well put together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when it comes to looking at a complete package - particularly one involving a flagship - it's important to take the price tag into account. At the time of release, many manufacturers promote their flagship as their technological pinnacle and tend to hike the price up accordingly, so it's important to see just how much bang you're getting for your buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the Xperia T can be found for ?550 in most markets, which is rather steep, especially considering that certain quad-core smartphones can be had for less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One such candidate is the HTC One X, which currently retails for around ?100 less than the Xperia T. Besides the upgrade to a quad-core 1.5 GHz Tegra 3 chipset, it gives you the same 720p resolution screen, except slightly larger by about 0.15 inches. There's also double the internal storage of the Xperia T, a higher Bluetooth version, and an upgrade to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean allegedly coming next month is an added bonus. You'll be sacrificing some camera resolution with the 8 MP camera (down from 13 MP on the T) although it is still capable of 1080p video recording, and 720p on the front-facer is there, too. The HTC One X does not have a microSD card slot though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the One X, the Samsung Galaxy S III brings some quad-core muscle to the show at less cost. The Super AMOLED on the S III is also of 720p resolution, but boasts a bigger 4.8 inch diagonal. You're getting an impressive set of features, including some really neat (and exclusive) tricks at the expense of some rear camera resolution. You'll also enjoy some more uptime with the 2100 mAh battery, and there's microSD support as well. The 16 GB version of the Galaxy S III can be had for about ?480 in most markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, with another flagship looming on the horizon, all of these top droids will be given a real run for their money. The LG Optimus G doubles up both the internal memory and RAM of the Sony Xperia T, and features the first quad-core Krait processor. The Optimus G chipset made easy work of the competition and put devices like the Xperia T in a rather awkward position. Just arriving to the market and they are already offering only half the performance of best in business. The Optimus G also boasts a larger 2100 mAh battery, but no microSD support. It will go on sale for around ?600, or just ?50 more than the Sony Xperia T.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we've looked at devices which are much better than the Xperia T on paper, we can't forget to factor in build quality and design. The Xperia T feels sturdier and more solid than both the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III (with the glaring exception of the poorly-designed microSD/SIM card cover), and the curved back panel not only makes holding the Xperia T a more pleasurable experience, but also separates it from a design template that currently dominates the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the Android experience is something that has largely been the same across different OEMs, Sony has struck a great balance between great-looking apps and features on an optimized Android core that looks fresh yet familiar. True that while the Xperia T may be behind in the numbers race, the software package that it delivers is truly among the nicest we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sometimes it's not enough to simply have the best around - you want to make a statement. Where some makers let the numbers talk, Sony are trying to appeal to emotions with the Xperia T's top notch design and feel. We're happy with the meal, but we guess there's room for dessert. And we sure hope Jelly Bean doesn't take too long.</paragraph>
