			<subsectionTitle>Look what the courier brought over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Everybody in our office was overwhelmed with joy. Nokia N91 has finally been launched. We first saw the N91 model approximately an year ago, but since then we would only hear "postponed", "not yet", "be patient and wait a little bit more" etc. And here it is - an attractive box in the courier's hands, which made an entire year of waiting seem as if it had never happened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N91</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everyone in our office has remained a fan of Nokia N91 ever since, though. Certain colleagues of mine cannot even stand this phone for its pure size and roughness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let me start from the beginning and I am sure that at the end of this review you will have a more precise idea of what Nokia N91 is like and whether it is worth investing the great deal of money it costs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Comparison to Nokia 6681 and Nokia N70 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I thought that it would not take me long before I started to feel bored with the bluish glossy plastics on Nokia N91's front panel, but it did not. I must confess that N91 is simply an eye-catching device. People in the city transport media would not turn their eyes from it, while my friends would usually first ask me "What's that thing you have?", instead of "Hi, how are you?"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Size comparison to a credit card ? the phone held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 is a serious piece of a phone. It measures 113 x 55 x 22 mm. It makes the N70 model look like a poor relative. When I first had the phone in my hands, it seemed as if its 164 grams made it crane forward a bit. It was a mistake. I managed to make Nokia N91 balance on a single finger placed in the center of the phone body. Apparently, the initial feeling was due to the way I was holding the phone. In other words, I had to learn to hold Nokia N91 like a small baby, underlying its "head" with my pointing finger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Finger skating<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A great part of the phone body is made of real steel. Unlike Nokia 8800, N91 is not glossy, but rather matt. It gives the impression of a device of far more value than its forerunners, even if this may be considered extravagant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lots of luster</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is the biggest metal-made part of the phone. The lock button is located on the right. Press it to remove the entire cover. At one time I forgot about this button and tried to open the phone without its "permission". It opened seamlessly, which is quite bad. Besides, the rear cover shows a slight gap, which is otherwise invisible when you hold the phone in your hand. In the picture below you can observe the tiny gap in N91's back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Rear cover gap ? lock button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some members of our editorial team call Nokia N91 "the paddle". I myself, however, do like the enlargement in the top part of the device. I find this solution a good one. The joint is smooth. There were few elements my thumb went into this part of the phone. For example, in the bottom, where I am used to find the Pop-Port connector, Nokia N91 only has a narrow port for the charger and a microphone. The latter is located straight in the sliding cover and thus takes a perfect position close to the caller's mouth, when the keypad is opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Microphone and charger port ? microphone location</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features a connector for the USB cable, enclosed in the retail package, and a swing volume control button. The loud speaker grill is just below the volume button. It is a pity that Nokia designers have not mounted another loud speaker on the opposite side of the body. It would have come in handy. Nokia N91 loud speaker is among the best on the market. Yet, its loudness is not sufficient for listening to music on a busy street. As it seems, Nokia 3250 remains the phone with the most powerful loud speaker in the entire Nokia family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; MiniUSB connector ? loud speaker grill</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part takes after the N70 design. Here you will find the main switch-off button and two untraditional elements, one of which is the manual keypad lock, an easy to use sliding button. Automatic keylock after several seconds of inactivity is also available, but the manual one is more convenient. Here I am obliged to make another reference to N91 constructional imperfection in consideration to its high price. The keylock switch became loose after a mere few days of usage. Nokia designers do disappoint at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Main switch-off button ? keypad locking keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise though, is the earpiece connector. This is the first time that Nokia uses a standard 3.5 mm jack incorporated in the very body of the phone. In other words, there is no need to buy an additional adapter; you can simply pick up your earphones and plug them into the handset. The connector itself consists of two parts. The first one is a regular 3,5 mm audio jack and the second one is for the remote control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Remote control and its connection</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally a standard jack fits in seamlessly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element located on this side of the phone is the button for access to the main menu. In other Nokia smartphones this button usually constitutes a part of the functional keypad, while in Nokia N91 it is too far from the front cover. Getting used to its location requires some time. I myself would have appreciated more a solution, where the main menu access button is located a bit lower, at the level of the lock of the rear cover.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What a pity indeed...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>... that Nokia has abandoned the high-resolution (352 x 416 pixels) display line it launched with the N90 model. Nokia has incorporated it in Nokia N80 and is planning to do so in other two models of the E line. I don't get, however, what constructors and designers were working on for such a long time before Nokia N91 was officially launched...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here I am, looking at 176 x 208 pixels, seeing icon legends in the smaller font typical for the latest Symbian 9.1 OS. Lower resolution in Nokia N91 is quite visible when loking at smaller objects on the display. I am comparing N91 with Nokia 6681 (I just had it around) and I have the feeling that, although a true veteran, Nokia 6681 provides a far better visualization than N91.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 display has dimensions of 35 x 41 mm. It has lower contrast levels and SMS writing under direct daylight is quite a difficult task. A few weeks ago we tested the 3250 model, which features the same resolution like Nokia N91. Images on its display, however, looked significantly better, although the display is the same size as the Nokia N91 display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire area around the display is glossy, but does not require as frequent cleaning as in the case of the luxurious 8800 model. Main control buttons are situated below the display. Nokia N91 has a four-way joystick with a confirming central area accompanied by soft keys and the pair of red and green receiver keys. All these elements play a bit, which is quite annoying, believe me.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No frequent polishing is necessary?surprising indeed ? main control elements</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, tactile response is great. During testing I didn't make a single mistake when selecting or confirming. The whole block of control buttons is slightly inclined towards the user's fingers for more comfortable work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main control elements are bound a bit to make navigation smoother </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Small, blue, located under the cover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad cover design is not very successful. In order to move the cover, it is necessary to put your finger on the groove beneath the joystick. Yet, make sure you have not eaten anything greasy (chips or fries, for example) before that as you risk losing any chance to complete it at all since your fingers are quite likely to slip off to the Play/Pause and run the Music Player. What's worse, Nokia N91 features no mechanical support to help open its keypad cover - a solution I personally find important, considering the size and the technological level of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> After having moved the cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing I do like about the construction is the solid click sound of the arresting mechanism of the sliding cover when you open it. Apart from that, the cover plays constantly, although in a slight degree. One last assuring look is neccessary to make sure the cover is fully closed as the endstop is not marked acoustically. Besides, when the cover is open, its edges cut my palm. And when I turned the device over, the visible printed circuits really made me sick design-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric keypad consists of extremely small keys considering the body size of the phone. It will probably take you some time before you start using the keys correctly. I am still not able to touch-find the correcting and editing keys. Let's not forget, however, that my thumb is rather big. Nokia designers deserve a compliment for their high-class work on functional keys as tactile reaction is pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Keypad and its details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are illuminated in deep blue. The red and green receivers retain their respective color. The joystick is surrounded by light too. To my opinion, the backlighting of the functional keys could have been a little bit more intensive. Otherwise the backlighting itself is so strong that you will even see how badly the bonds between the keypad and the mobile frame are put together.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New Fairy-tale in old style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are a devoted reader of our reviews, you surely remember our criticizm against the incompatibility of the new Nokia 3250 OS with old Symbian applications. Nokia N91 is equipped with Symbian 9.1 and the situation is quite similar. If you buy the phone, you will simply have to wait until a modified or, even better, a brand new version of your favorite software is launched, not to mention paid re-registrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active display has undergone smaller modifications. As usual, here you will find standard details like clock, date, day of the week, operator's logo and two indicators: one for the battery and one for the signal. The names of the applications assigned to the two buttons beneath the display appear in the bottom bar of the display (these applications are customizable). Both font type and size are new, but as I mentioned in the previous chapter, the 176 x 208 resolution is much too insufficient for smaller objects and hints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by display, first used in Nokia 6681, is situated in the middle of the display. In N91, however, it features 6 icons instead of 5, and each one can be assigned for a frequently used function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the bar of the stand-by display you will see today's events from the calendar or the earliest of the upcoming events in the next few days. Here you can also see the number of unaccomplished tasks as well as the name of the currently played MP3 file. What's more, all abovementioned data blocks are active, meaning that assigned applications like calendar, task manager, or music player are accessed by a single click on the respective icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Active stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four ways of the joystick cannot be assigned a certain function as they are needed in the active stand-by mode. If you deactivate the stand-by mode, Nokia N91 behaves exactly like any other Nokia smartphone: state icons and time and date details are the only ones visible on the display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A step back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu is displayed as a matrix of icons. Originally, Nokia smartphones had a matrix of the 3 x 3 type. Later Nokia launched the 3250 model, where icons were distributed in a 4 x 3 matrix. In the case of N91 software designers have decided to go back to the "three times three" model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main menu in a 3 x 3 matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you could also view the main menu as a standard list of items. Each item represents a separate application. Items can be freely reordered. For example, you can adjust the main menu to your needs by placing the most frequently used applications on the first positions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Main menu as a list of items ? marking the Music icon ? and changing it with the Media one</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall outlook of the phone can be changed by graphic themes. These change not only the main display wallpaper, but also background in different menus, icon design, colors, symbols, etc. Nokia N91 offers a few preinstalled themes. Additional ones are available both on the Internet and in stores. You may also try to create your own wallpapers in PC Suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;&nbsp; Graphic themes</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Red key, Java, and a collapse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want to press the red receiver key to return to the main display of the phone, all running applications will get immediately closed, just like it happened in Nokia N70 or Nokia 3250. As this did not use to happen in older smartphones, it will take you some time to get used to it. You have to, though. Otherwise, you will end up closing important applications, which, I believe, is not a good thing at all. To switch between minimized running programs, use the bar, which appears after a long press of the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bar for switching between active applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As any smartphone Nokia N91 runs slower than common mobile phones. The start up of the phone alone takes approximately half a minute, which is more or less the same as in Nokia 3250. Sometimes work with the main menu in Nokia N91 is even slower as the phone makes you wait before the built-in disk is accessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 scored brilliantly in Java speed tests. I used the standard application JBenchmark and here is what I got:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compare it to Nokia N70:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the intensive testing process I found myself forced to restart Nokia N91 at least five times a day. It is instable. If I keep a higher amount of notes and events in the organizer and I leave an application working in the background, the main display often decides not to show me the selection bar in the active stand-by mode, while hiding the legends of the context keys at the same time. This logically leads to malfunctioning of the context keys. Well, as we all know, first firmware versions are never perfect, but in the case of Nokia N91, which made us wait pretty long for the official launch, the abovementioned hitches are hard to accept.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You have 999 pictures left to take<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The name of the "Photo-Video" menu is clear enough. It takes you into the interface of the built-in 2 megapixel camera. Nokia N91 is held vertically, even if it is said to be a photo mobile phone. The speed of the capturing of the first picture is quite high for a smartphone with OS. The speed of picture reading and viewing is a little bit slower, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera lens is not protected </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Browsing the Gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Displaying image result ? work with images ? in a full-screen mode ? turned</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lower speed is caused by the slower work of the built-in hard disk. Nokia N91 boasts an incredible amount of 4 GB memory, which literally means that you will hardly ever see any other announce than "You have left: &gt; 999 pictures". Apart from the maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels the N91?s camera also offers the lower, classic VGA resolution. The quality of the photos is similar to that of the 2 megapixel photo mobile kings Sony Ericsson K750/W800/D750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera interface ? Setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample Photos in Full Resolution: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 does not offer exposure compensation. Yet, the white balance setting works in automatic, sunny, cloudy, fluorescent and incandescent modes. In addition, the phone allows for applying sepia color effect, as well as black &amp; white, and negative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Setting up self-release function ? white balance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up color nuance ? scanning options ? extensive help section</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Color nuances: normal ? sepia Color nuances: black &amp; white ? negative</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Night mode is pretty good. It reduces noise far more significantly than the competing mobiles. The night mode view finder has a certain delay, of course. What a pity that the phone lacks a flash. Among other extras you will also find sequence capturing and self-release in 10, 20, and 30 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Normal mode ? night mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Nokia N91 does not focus well in macro mode, closely situated objects look bad. Photos of text located in close and medium-far distance are of particularly poor quality. 20x digital zoom is quite smooth. It is controlled through the joystick. Resulting images are not mere crops. Half-zoom is somewhat helpful, while maximum zoom is absolutely useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Poor results in macro mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;No zoom ? half-degree zoom ? maximum 20x zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When I zoom and then press the release button, a dark image frequently appears on the display. A second shot is usually successful. A firmware problem once again, I guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Preparation for zoom... ? ...dark image comes after the release button is pressed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I was very pleased with the high quality of the videos shot with Nokia N91. The phone stores up to 60-minute records in MP4 format with a resolution of 352 x 288 pixels. Video runs smoothly. The microphone captures sound very well. While shooting you can zoom or use all color effects described in the photo camera section of this review. Sound recording can deactivated, if necessary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Visual Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 features a "Visual" radio, that is, a radio that simultaneously receives standard broadcasts and sends out data. The radio works in all available FM bands without any problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The interface of Visual Radio ? menu options ? incl. station name</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Broadcast quality is surprisingly good. Nokia N91 stores up to 20 radio stations. Signal search is lightning fast: a single press on the list keys is enough to run the broadcast with strongest signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Radio sound is generally good, even if less loud and clear than the sound produced by the music player (see next chapter). Nokia switches between stereo and mono signal automatically, in accordance with the intensity of the selected radio broadcast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Saving a new radio station ? change of station order ? manual tuning ? application settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am a little bit surprised that neither the name, nor the frequency of the broadcasting radio station appears on the active stand-by display, when the radio is minimized. Radio is controlled either by the buttons on the keypad cover, or through the use of the remote control on the headset cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset or more precisely its cable serves as an antenna. I tested radio properties by connecting the remote control only, but sound remained perfect. Nokia N91 kept receiving brilliantly the majority of the available stations. The only drawback is the lack of a good equalizer. Is anyone of you, designers, planning to ever implement one in your future mobile models?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of space<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia calls the N91 model a music mobile phone. The combination of 4GB of memory space and smooth running USB support represents a true comfort. I even tested a Motorola miniUSB cable and it worked reliably. When connected to a PC, N91 appears as a new hard disk. From this point on, you simply can start copying your favorite music files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> MiniUSB cable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone always asks you, in which mode you prefer to work. There are three options to choose from:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in Hitachi Microdrive disk is very small. It is situated between the camera lens and the battery bed. Its precise dimensions are 32 x 24 mm. It rotates at a speed of 3600 rpm, with an access time of 8 ms. The transfer of a 6 MB music file takes no more than 12 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 music player is brilliant, except for several insignificant details. ID3 tags are supported, of course. The player allows for creating infinite amount of playlists. Music files are automatically ordered by artist and album name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Music player interface ? menu options ? repeating option</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music files can be downloaded into the MyMusic folder through a standard "explorer". Every time you run the music player after new data has been downloaded the phone reminds itself that it should browse all available files and order them in a rational way. As expected, Nokia N91 does all this by itself. The time it needs to file new information is proportional to the amount of this information. For example, two albums, each one of 10 songs, take the phone approximately 15 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Would you like to reorder files after synchronization? ? re-filing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The work with the player menu is similar to the work with iPod devices. First you enter the album or artist folder, then you open the particular album (N91 counts total time automatically), and finally you get to the individual songs. According to the Nokia official website the search of a particular song takes approximately 12 ms; each additional song needs a mere 1 ms; an entire song is read within 22 ms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Menu's main section ? artists ? an album with its songs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is minimized, the name of the current song and its progress appear on the active stand-by display. When you go for the next song, it first appears in the upper right corner of the display, where it waits for your definite decision about a second. I you do not press NEXT again, it starts to play. I like this solution, because you can freely browse music files, without making the phone scan and read every marked song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Playing music on the active stand-by display ? selecting the following music file</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player application can also be controlled through the large keys situated on the keypad cover. They function smoothly and impeccably. The protruding bulgy button in the upper right corner of the cover takes you from the menu to the music player and vice versa. In order to make the switch between both applications possible, the music player remains constantly minimized in the background and a switch-off is impossible. On the other hand, by no means does the player harm the overall performance of the system. A long press on the above mentioned key opens the radio application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;It is born for music player control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with respective buttons on the body of the phone, the player can also work with the remote control, which features a built-in microphone and a clip. The remote control together with the earpieces serve perfectly as a high-quality handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    &nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Nokia N91 original package you will find a HS-28 headset (remote control included). But if you are keen on seriously using the phone as a music player, please put the original Nokia headset aside. They are not bad at all, but are still worse compared to the headsets of the Nokia N91 competitors. They are incomparable to the brilliant performance of Sony Ericsson W800 plugs, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I tested Nokia N91 with a Koss Porta Pro set. Sound is perfect, all acoustic elements being precise and clear. I tried to fiddle a bit with the built-in 8-band equalizer, but it seemed unnecessary. If your earphones are good, default setup is ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eight-band equalizer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 has a function called "extended stereo", which works in a way similar to the SRS WOW effects in standard Windows Media Player. Eventually, I decided to leave it constantly on as it opens sound and is really useful. As far as the built-in sound amplifier is concerned, it is the most powerful one I have ever listened to in a mobile phone. My ears stopped recognizing individual sound elements from under 75% of its volume capacity. Each volume modification is accompanied by a slightly disturbing cracking tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Extensive sound setting options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound became even better, when I plugged in the Sennheiser HD 215 headset. I am sure that even editors of audio-tech magazines would have liked it. The Nokia audio technicians have done an excellent job. It would be interesting to put the musical features of Nokia N91 and Sony Ericsoon W800 head to head in a dedicated review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery low<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 91 derives its energy from a Lithium-Ion battery, which has the extremely insufficient capacity of 900 mAh supporting a mere 190 hours of stand-by time and 240 minutes of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery </paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's worse, those are the numbers Nokia announces in the official information. If you mean to frequently listen to music or write plenty of SMS, be prepared for even shorter battery cycles as both mentioned activities are highly energy-consuming. For example, I am currently using N91 as a work mobile phone, but whenever I have a chance, I switch to the MP3 player and listen to music. Under such workload Nokia N91 makes it through no more than one entire day and one entire night. Then it begs again for another energy injection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the phone's retail package I found a cute active desk stand. Active means that a charger can be plugged into it and you can charge the phone in this stand. When Nokia N91 is in the desk stand, the display is perfectly legible. The stand is steel-coated, just like the phone itself. It sits on a rubber platform, which improves the overall stability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Was Symbian 9.1 OS really necessary?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call functions have undergone very few modifications. All properties seem identical to those known from older Nokia mobiles with Symbian OS. Changes are minor. Sound quality is brilliant. The receiver speaker produces full, deep sound. The loud speaker is slightly less powerful than I expected. Calls can be recorded, but the record itself is limited to a mere minute, which is a big disappointment in respect to the huge capacity of the hard disk. The opposite side is alerted about the recording process by a short beep every three seconds or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calling process ? options available during call execution ? activating the voice recorder ? a mere one minute</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Received, missed, and dialed calls are saved into independent tabs, which are opened by a press on the green receiver key. Call records' date and time are always available, but if dialed numbers repeat or calls come from one and the same number, they appear only once, accompanied by the date and the time of the last made call attempt plus the entire number of events corresponding to the respective item. Numbers can be dialed or saved into the phonebook. SMS can be sent directly from the call records lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Call log and data transfers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The log stores detail on both call duration and transferred data. If you need more info, go to the properties section, where each call and data connection is described in detail. Unfortunately, export function that would get the above mentioned information out of the phone is not available. The call lists store data from the last 30 days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extensive phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 phonebook uses shared memory, which means that it puts no limits as to the number of contacts or amount of phone numbers. Apart from first and last name (each of which constitutes a separate field), each contact in the phonebook can also be assigned the following fields: company, job, nickname, mobile numbers, land-line numbers, video call numbers, fax numbers, pager numbers, email addresses, web addresses, notes, street addresses, birth date. As you can see, there is a lot of it (I counted a total of 38 fields). The phone seems to be able to even store a hundred of phone numbers for one single contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Phonebook ? contact detail ? filling in new fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How you are going to open Nokia N91 phonebook is only up to you. The phonebook icon usually appears on first position in the active stand-by mode, but it can also be assigned to one of the context keys. Once you enter the phonebook, you only need to start to write the initials of the first or the last name of the person you are looking for and the phone starts to browse on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All names stored in the phonebook can be voice dialed. Nokia N91 does not require recording of one's own name labels as it recognizes all voice types. Voice dialing functions fabulously. Once the respective key has been pressed and the searched name has been pronounced, the phone displays an image of the corresponding person, reads their name with a mechanic voice, and dials their default number. Search becomes even faster if you assign a shortcut numeric key to each of the numbers you dial frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Assignation of shortcut key ? automatic voice orders in the menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Callers can be assigned a picture, while contact groups are assigned only a special ringtone. Assigning ringtones to individual callers and distinguishing groups with pictures is impossible. Groups can be used as call filters inside ringing profiles. Nokia N91 has 6 ringing profiles plus an additional one to use in offline mode. Key lock option is available as well. More profiles can be user-created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Profiles and their settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the profiles you can set up a particular ringing tone for calls, messages, emails, and chat. From here you can also regulate volume, vibration, keypad tones, and filters. Nokia N91 is even able to pronounce the name of the person who is calling you, if it's stored in the phonebook. You do not even need to look at the display to find out the caller's name. In fact, this function explains quite well why Nokia N91 does not offer an option for assigning particular ringtones to the contacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Message application has not undergone any major changes, either. The process of SMS, MMS, email and instant messages typing can be assisted by the famous T9 dictionary. T9 uses diacritics, which do not get deleted before message is sent. Pictures inserted into MMS can be automatically minimized to a size suitable for MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Message editor ? received messages ? sent messages ? selecting the receiver ? writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email client works with the most popular protocols: SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4. Message headers are downloaded first. A download of the entire message is only possible after the deliberate selection of an individual email.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Time organization and Internet as good as they should be<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter I am going to repeat some of my statements published in the Nokia 3250 review as both phones are pretty similar in terms of time organizing and internet functions. As it became clear in previous chapters, devices of the Series 60 look alike in a number of aspects. The new Symbian 9.1 brings few and very insignificant modifications. Time organizing tools have remained more or less unchanged, too. The calendar, the task manager, the notes are all identical to those in Nokia 3250. Here are some more applications that are to be found in Nokia N91: a calculator, a unit converter and a clock. The alarms are not repeatable and there isn't a "safe" wallet for codes and passwords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Month view at the calendar ? week view ? day view ? new entry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing event details ? organizer setup ? calculator ? alarm clock ? converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in web browser offers all known basic functions: actual page visualization, simple java scripts support, transferred data counter etc. If you select the smallest font size available, the display will offer you the unbelievable 16 lines. However, text placed in these lines is practically illegible due to low resolution. As to the Internet connection, the best option available is the preinstalled Wi-Fi software: it searches fast, informs you whether available networks are protected or not, and shows signal coverage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Browser interface ? searching for access points ? selecting connection ? webpage</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Browser menu ? setup ? selecting wireless networks ? information about available WLAN</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N91 transfers data through Bluetooth or via the USB cable enclosed in the phone's package. Infrared port is missing. Nokia seems to have generally acquired the habit of removing Infrared support in its smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Go discover the world using Nokia mobile data transfers in cooperation with GPRS Class 10, the faster EDGE Class 10, or perhaps the best of all: UMTS. Nokia N91 comes with an installation CD with a full-function PC Suite. You can download its latest version from www.nokia.com.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Just like a real celebrity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That is how Nokia N91 behaves. It is shiny, full of high-tech functions like UMTS, Wi-Fi; amazing 4 GB memory space; USB support; a standard 3.5 mm earphones jack. A phone with such a price tag should have all this. In addition, listening to music with Nokia N91 is a true pleasure and time organizing functions are superb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the celebrity surely does have some flaws. It is much too complicated from inside as not to make the mobile world speak and write about it. For example, we will have to wait at least a few months before a pack of applications compatible with Symbian 9.1 appears on the market. Further on, I cannot help, but once again draw your attention to the phone construction imperfections, to the 1-minute limited voice recorder, the "hard-headed" T9 dictionary, etc. Why isn't there a second camera for video calls? Why use a hard disk instead of a flash drive? Where were the Nokia designers during all these long preparation months, when the launch of Nokia N91 was constantly postponed? Where is the so longed maturity?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>David Polesny's point of view:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It has been a whole year since I first saw Nokia N91. At that moment, I was struck speechless. The futuristic N91 was so rich in features and looked so unusual that it literally took my breath away. I remember that the initial version of the phone was full of imperfections, but Nokia representatives made an official promise that the final Nokia N91 would be precisely elaborated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it appears that the year taken for improvements has hardly improved anything. The sliding part of the keypad does not close well, the tiny numeric keys have not changed a bit; what's worse, they do play a lot. The work of the functional keys and the joystick is not convincing, either. Why should I expect that such an expensive mobile is to be solid, firm, and precise? Because it's exactly what it should be like?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I just find Nokia N91 much too big and heavy, no matter how great its software potential is. I do not like the design solution of the top part of the phone. I find it ugly. Whatsoever, there is no doubt that Nokia N91 looks like a luxury mobile device. Glossy elements suit it well, but they require frequent polishing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I did not have much time to "play" with the Nokia N91. In any case, I do not mind the unusual location of the Menu button. It just requires some practice. I appreciate the hardware keylock located on the top edge of the phone as well as the universal earphone jack. The greatest disappointment in Nokia N91 for me is its display, and more precisely, it's low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is user-friendly, yet somewhat slow. Sound is good, with the potential of becoming superb, if a high-class set of earphones is used. The cracking tones that accompany each volume modification are the only acoustic drawback of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, I am disappointed with Nokia N91. Such expensive phone, one of such a high class should in no case feature so many failures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mark Lutonsky's point of view:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I have the worst words prepared for Nokia N91. It is a true monster, huge and heavy. Apparently, Nokia designers have not devoted much time to the phone's outlook. N91 looks as a paddle. When opened, the sliding keypad cover is dangerously sharp. Access to the numeric keypad is not satisfying. The cover itself is difficult to be manipulated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N91 display is more than disappointing. It looks rough, especially if compared to displays with QVGA resolution (to be found in most current high-class mobile phones). Display interface has been slightly modified, font size has been reduced. The greatest inconvenience, however, lies in the incompatibility of the new Symbian 9.1 with software applications and programs used in the current line of mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I decided not to take my first impressions seriously. When Nokia first released its N91 model a year ago, I tried not to pay attention to my inner voice and to make myself believe the promises that everything would be different, better. Design, construction, control... Well, as you could see, nothing has changed. Nokia N91 is the same freak of nature as it was on the day of its promotion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without a question, Wi-Fi support, the music player and a large jack for the earphones are all the conveniences we all like to see in other phones. To my opinion, however, the mechanical hard disk with a 4 GB capacity encumbers the device more than it helps. The situation would have been completely different if you could fit a few dozens of GB into the phone. In such case the hard disk technology would have doubtlessly come in handy.</paragraph>
