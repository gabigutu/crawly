			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Launched during AT&amp;T's developer conference at CES 2013, the Pantech Discover is the company's most capable Android smartphone to hit the United States yet. The LTE handset follows the same formula as its two predecessors, the Pantech Burst and the Pantech Flex championed over the last year. It consists of offering top shelf specs for entry-level money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset featuring two 1.5GHz Krait CPU cores, 4.8" HD display and 16GB of built-in, further expandable memory on board, it is not difficult to mistake the Pantech Discover for the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S III. Heck, one can even argue that the Pantech is a more enticing offering as it one-ups the Samsung royalty with a 12.6MP camera and a pair of 3D surround sound speakers on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the newcomer's full list of talents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After taking a closer look at the list of features which the Pantech Discover has to offer, there's little doubt that the device has plenty to offer, especially considering its price range. The 12.6MP camera and stereo speakers are impressive even by today's flagship standards. As for the dual-core chipset and 720p screen - it was only a couple of months ago when they were still the best available combination on the US market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the device's negatives go, we were mostly puzzled by the lack Android 4.1 Jelly Bean out of the box, now that Jelly Bean has been out for more than six months. As for the slow camera performance, hopefully the image quality will make up for the extra wait between shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, is the Pantech Discover a budget Android smartphone hero? Its specs certainly point this way, so we are curious to find out. As always, we are going to kick the review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare bones retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover comes in an AT&amp;T branded retail box. Inside it, you will find a USB cable and a charger, along with some booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the smartphone's retail package is hardly inspiring, it is more or less the standard for US bound smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover looks pleasantly understated. The handset features only two hardware buttons - a fact which will be warmly appreciated by fans of minimalist looks. The pleasant curves on the device's back on the other hand, combined with the metal strip and speaker grilles on its edges, throw in a welcome dash of premium credentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is only available in a gray color scheme at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is solid. The phone's body is made of high-quality plastic which appears ready for plenty of daily abuse. Its buttons feel reassuringly solid when pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Pantech Discover are 134.2 x 68.6 x 9.1 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 135 grams. Due to its ultra-thin bezel, the smartphone feels narrow despite its massive display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.8" LCD display of the device offers 720p resolution and RGB matrix - it is a departure from recent AMOLED efforts by Pantech. The HD display offers great viewing angles to go with its solid brightness, so even a picky user will find little to frown at, especially given the device's price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you will find the earpiece and an AT&amp;T logo, the front-facing camera, as well as an ambient light and proximity sensors. The mouthpiece and a Pantech logo are located below the display - nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and one of the stereo speakers are located on the left side of the device. The other speaker sits lonely on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the power/lock key are located on top of the device. There is nothing but the microUSB port on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the Pantech Discover is where the 12.6MP camera and single LED flash are located. Another set of Pantech and AT&amp;T logos are present too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you remove, the battery cover of the smartphone, you will find the microSIM and microSD card slots. The 2100mAh battery is user-replaceable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a 2100mAh battery on board, the Pantech Discover did a commendable job in our battery test by achieving a rating of 48h. This means that you will need to recharge you device every two days if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Pantech Discover is a pleasure. The device is narrow for its screen size which, combined with its grippy plastic back, even offers the possibility for one-handed operation - a rare feat these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing to frown at as far as the look and feel of the Pantech Discover go. Following next is a closer look at the smartphone's software talents.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich with a heavy Pantech input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover comes with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box. We were told that Jelly Bean update is planned, but no timeline was provided for it. Google's OS is dressed in a really functional UI from Pantech. Check it out in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most impressive tweaks, which Pantech brought to Android in its Discover, is the lock screen. The latter packs the impressive six shortcuts, which can take you straight to the homescreen, the camera app, the music player, the text messages, web browser, as well as the phone dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven homescreen panels at your disposal. You can arrange them any way you want but, unfortunately, add and delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docked icons on the bottom of the homescreen can be customized too. You can add two extra rows which can be accessed by swiping a finger to the left and to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding and removing widgets is business as usual. There's plenty to choose from out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been seriously touched. It has an additional, slide-out section, which adds more settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application launcher can be customized as well. You can view the apps as an alphabetical list or a grid. You can create folders too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also themes at your disposal. They do very much resemble the ones offered by another Korean maker. They include Work, Play, etc. You can also save your own. You can even change the style of your phone dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just in case the above customizations are not sufficient enough for you, Pantech also gives you the opportunity to change the set of icons the Discover. There are two sets available - stylish and modern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a task manager at your disposal. It can be accessed via dedicated widget. It shows CPU, RAM, and network data usage for the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is a standard ICS affair. Pantech have sprinkled some extra functionality to it by adding shortcuts to a pop-up notepad, music or video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have the biggest change Pantech made to the otherwise colorful, but familiar looking UI - the Easy Experience. It is directed at first time smartphone users, who are still abundant in the United States. With the press of a button, the easy experience transforms your Pantech Discover into an overpowered feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once turned on, the easy experience offers only one homescreen with larger icons for access to the most common functions of the device. The lockscreen gets simplified too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover sports a Snapdragon S4 chipset with two Krait CPU cores, clocked at 1.5GHz, to go with an Adreno 225 GPU. The same internals can be found in just about every top shelf Android smartphone launched in the United States last year. Naturally, the smartphone performed in line with similarly equipped devices. Here's how it fared.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can probably guess, the smartphone handled every task we threw at it with ease. Its internals also make it future proof too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A hassle free phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover phonebook offers the typical for all Android smartphones functionality. There is practically no limit to the amount of detail you can add to a contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The telephony of the Pantech Discover does offer smart dialing and works like a charm. The call quality was flawless and so was the signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker quality is superb too - it benefits greatly from the duo of speakers on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has all bases covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover's messaging department, unsurprisingly, boasts a rich functionality. Messages can be arranged by a date or contact name. Adding multimedia to a message automatically turns it into MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported. The latest major update finally can fit messages to the device's screen, as well as gives you the option to zoom in on them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text entry, you have two options out of the box in the Pantech Discover - an Android keyboard from the manufacturer, as well as the award-winning SwiftKey keyboard. The latter is arguably the best input method for Android, so we were pleased to see it preinstalled - it saves you a couple of dollars.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android ICS gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Discover uses the standard Android ICS gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you - aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there's nothing new really. And don't you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and as soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music player of the Pantech Discover has all the functionality you will ever need. You have equalizer presets at your disposal, as well as the option to create your own. 3D sound effects are also on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When playing, you can access the player straight from your homescreen without unlocking it. Naturally, it is also available in the notification area once you do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover's video player offers pop-up play too - a move taken straight from the Samsung Galaxy S III playbook. In the case of the Discover, it is called mini videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover handled all major video formats without breaking a sweat. Large files were also a go, due to the beefy CPU and chipset. Be aware though, that the 720p LCD display eats into the battery quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual audio speakers are a great companion to the video player. They offer great sound experience when watching videos in a casual setting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A 12.6MP camera at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover offers a camera with an eye-popping resolution considering the price of the phone. Android smartphones of much higher stature still have to make do with 8MP units. Here, there are dedicated HDR and panorama modes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple and intuitive. There are two shortcut bars on both sides of the viewfinder, which allow you to access all the camera options. The one on the left can be hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On small flaw we found was the relatively slow focusing time, compared to its competitors. It is hardly a deal breaker, but it certainly requires some getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pleasantly surprised of the high image quality the Pantech Discover delivers. In good light the photos are nicely detailed with low noise. The only issue we managed to spot was a certain softness on the right hand side of all photos but that can be a a unit-specific problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camcorder shoots 1080p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the one found in the still camera. The same shortcut bars can be found on both sides of the viewfinder, so no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover shoots nice and smooth 1080p videos at 30fps. Despite the fact that it uses the inferior .3gp file container, the Discover's videos come out with great level of detail and commendable quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos have a bitrate of 18Mbps and the sound stream is recorded in stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a short untouched 1080p video clip (26MB), which you can download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity with more options than you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can probably guess, the connectivity is fully covered in the Pantech Discover. That includes NFC connectivity with Android Beam preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T's LTE connectivity worked like a charm in the New York City area. We found nothing to frown at on that instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover also offers a Net Media app for sharing multimedia with other devices over a Wi-Fi network. It worked as expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Curiously, the Pantech Discover comes with two web browsers out of the box. There's an ICS web browser which has been modified by Pantech, and Google Chrome to keep it company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Pantech Browser did everything as expected, including flash support. Compared to Chrome, its UI looks slightly busier. You also get a pop-up menu at the bottom with social network sharing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome on the other hand, barely needs any introduction. It easily syncs with its desktop sibling and will likely be your go-to choice for web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing you must keep in mind, when using either browser is the battery life of the Pantech Discover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Fully stocked organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover, like all Android smartphones, has a capable organizer right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ThinkFree Office Pro is the default office editor. It opens and edits documents, spreadsheets and presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar, calculator, clock app, and a voice recorder are also preinstalled. They are all easy to operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tip calculator and pill reminder top off the list of the list of organizer talents.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover is stylish and affordable without compromising on functionality. If the handset had launched six months ago, it would have been one of best value offerings in the Android smartphone game. Unfortunately, it missed its chance and now it's merely a decent proposition in its price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clean, curvy lines of the device, combined with the small premium touches even add an aura of desirability to it - a first for a Pantech smartphone in the United States. The 720p 4.8-inch screen, the 12.6MP camera and stereo speakers set it apart from rivals, too. Stellar performance and a host of software tricks add further appeal to the device. We are particularly impressed with the Easy Mode UI - it makes the device more accessible for first-time smartphone buyers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We aren't particularly excited to get Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box seven months after Jelly Bean has been released, but we are hoping the manufacturer will keep its promise to release an update. Camera speed could have been better too - we've seen devices with lesser hardware being a lot more responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pantech Discover will set you back a highly acceptable $49.99 with a two-year commitment to AT&amp;T. Pantech's marketing department wants to convince you that choosing the device is a way to save $150 over a similarly equipped competitor. This would have easily been the case a few months ago, but today, the landscape looks slightly different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at major retailers such as Amazon Wireless reveals that the Samsung Galaxy S III is priced at only $79.99. AT&amp;T on the other hand, currently offers the mighty LG Optimus G for $99.99. Both devices are well worth the price difference over the Pantech offering, especially considering the total costs over the length of the contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy S III I747 ? LG Optimus G E970</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can be argued that the Pantech Discover is an attractive proposition with an off-contract price below $400. That might very well be the case, but in the US the 16GB LG-made Nexus 4 can be had for $350, and that one offers twice the processing power. By the way, T-Mobile is currently offering the Nexus 4 for $49.99 with a contract. As we see it, the only reason to pick the Discover over the Nexus 4 is the microSD card slot, which enables memory expansion on the cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems then that the Pantech Discover won't have a particularly easy ride in the current market. Priced way closer to the smartphone heavyweights than it's comfortable, it risks entering a battle that it simply cannot win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's up to Pantech to improve the Discover chances by releasing the Jelly Bean update and probably slashing its price to free on contract. Focusing the efforts on a market segment where it stands a chance seems the only way to go for the smartphone, regardless of what the initial plan was. There will be enough time for Pantech to attack the high-end when the Vega No 6 hits the US.</paragraph>
