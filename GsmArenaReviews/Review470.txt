			<paragraph>Siemens SF65 is an elegant clamshell phone of a modern design, a spinning display and a megapixel camera. The construction, though, has been taken over from Philips, which comes to reveal that this brand's favorers are to expect a lot of changes and surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Car manufacturers merge into big multinational corporations. They use the same components to create several models of different car makes for the purpose of lowering the expenses on production. The automobiles produced in this way have more or less the same parts. What differentiates them, though, is the design, which is to meet the requirements of the make given.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Official photos of Siemens SF65</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such practice has already become standard for the mobile phones business as well. The new Siemens SF65 works on the same constructional principles like Philips 760. Both telephones are equally equipped with the outlook being the only feature that differentiates them. A quick glance is enough to reveal that this phone has been developed in Philips' workshops and that the only job Siemens did was to design cover versions and user's environment of its own.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple is an inspiration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One would hardly deny that the new Siemens' SF65 elegancy is remarkable. The even glossy covers with their slightly oval edges and decently embedded elements give the strong impression of an integrated and compact device. There is no doubt that this smallish cuboid will become a thorn in the flesh of many manufacturers of luxurious and stylish mobile phones for this is the first time that Siemens makes a serious step into their "territory". Nevertheless, it once again proves the old statement that power comes with simplicity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Simply elegant; we got both color versions of the telephone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is going to be launched in two color versions - black and white; just like the music player Apple iPod, whose design may have served as an inspiration for Siemens developers. The famous designer Ora Ito has also let himself get inspired by the same device when creating the new Sagem myX-8. To cut a long story short, the "ala apple" design is cool these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The even white surface is "cool". Nor is the black one to be flung away... </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the new Siemens takes up space of 91 × 41 × 23 mm and weighs 97 g and thus fits into the common average class of mobile phones. Its cuboid form has been carefully elaborated with the edges being slightly round. Under the detachable cover, which actually serves as the phone's back cover, you will find a Li-Ion battery of 660 mAh capacity, which is expected to supply the phone with energy for up to 240 minutes of calling and up to 400 hours when in a standby mode. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to test phone's real durability time, but according to our first establishments it must be quite tolerable - do not forget that it is a dressed up Philips we have the honor to deal with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The phone is quite small ? back cover constitutes the whole rear side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction gives a solid general impression. No creaky sounds were to be noticed when opening the clamshell or spinning the display and the moving portion would always gently bottom when closing the phone. However, when I constricted the device, the front and the rear covers gave out some quite unpleasant sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Just like a sunflower following the sun... ? A detail of the spinner hinge </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The majority of all Philips clamshells suffer from a bit strange infirmity - the display portion is usually so heavy that it does not allow the phone to stay still on its bottom part when in an open mode and it outbalances easily. The new Siemens SF65 is no exception from this rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The telephone balancing on the edge ? Construction is remarkably firm </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No outer display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its spinner form factor the display can stay on view even if the phone is closed. Nothing of a new solution on the market with mobile devices for LG T5100 or Nokia 6260, for example, can already show off with this. In the case of Siemens' new model, however, the reversed display is usable in the camera mode only. By just reversing the display the phone mode gets automatically switched off and the camera mode gets activated. It is a pity though. Provided my phone is lying closed on the table, I would embrace the chance to check what time it is or whether a message has been received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The diode and the loudspeaker slot hole ? The display turned inside out.. ? ..and classically closed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is the information diode mounted on the front cover that is supposed to serve for quick checking of the missed calls or short messages. It does starts blinking (with a green and red light) when the phone is ringing or when a SMS has been received, but yet after having gone out, it stays dark for long four and a half minutes. Then it blinks for several seconds again and repeatedly takes a long break off. As a result, it is only by chance that one happens to notice a missed call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> That is how the diode blinks, regrettably not strongly enough </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front cover is totally smooth and glossy. The black version is especially impressive and therefore lures to finger games or makes you constantly rub the phone against your T-shirt. Besides the information diode here you will also find a small slot hole for the loudspeaker as well as the manufacturer's logo. At the top part of the cover there is a small chromium-plated area having no other function but the one of a design accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side is completely smooth likewise. It is decorated with the manufacturer's logo as well as by the camera's lens surrounded by a big circle frame, in which a diode for supplementary lighting is mounted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera with a diode for supplementary lighting placed on the rear side of the telephone  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side parts are decorated with a narrow chromium-plated stripe, the right side one of which is complemented by two volume buttons and the camera's release button. On the left side there are no buttons except for the infrared port at the bottom. A silver strip runs along the whole circumference of the phone interfered with by the system connector at the bottom part. The latter is the same like in the rest of Siemens' phones of Class 60. At the right upper corner a solid eye stands out for a stripe to be handled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display and keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As soon as you open the phone you see the phone's display and keypad. At a first glance, the display appears to be rather small. Its silver frame does not help much for it does not make it look optically bigger. The frame is extended by an area with buttons. There are also buttons above the display, which is a distinctive feature of Philips' mobile phones. Another pair of buttons is placed below the display. You will appreciate their functions when the camera mode is on. Here they help you move in the menu or activate the zoom. When the phone is opened, the two buttons above the display lack any function, while the ones mounted below the display substitute for the context keys on the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display is surrounded by buttons </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Zoom keys ? the two unobtrusive context keys </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is silver/grey in both color versions of the phone and is constituted of two separated blocks - the functional and the numeric parts. A main control element is the silver round four-way button with a black confirming central part. The surface of the ring is gently knurled. Around it you will find four bulky functional keys - two context ones and the traditional pair of a green and a red receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The keypad is dominated by a control ring </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is easy to manage. All functional keys, including the main button, are of a comfortable size and give a sure feedback. This holds true for the numeric part as well. The key lines are separated by deep grooves so that one cannot get mistaken even at a touch. The keypad has been perfectly constructed with the backlighting being the only exception. The latter is relatively weak; the light distribution could have been a little bit more even and finally, the main functional key is not illuminated at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   There is no other solution when a clamshell is involved - the keypad is completely flat ? the backlighting is relatively weak ? A white version of the keypad </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the display is simply beyond rebuke. It is active; it is able to show 65K colors and features a resolution of 128 × 160 pixels. However, as a tradition, it is not as big as it could have been, taking into account the plenty of free space left around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The display seen at direct daylight ? the quality of the display stands out the best when used in the dark </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Siemens or Philips?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the phone has been switched on an impressive animation starts running. A moment afterwards the standby mode of the display shows up to welcome you. It is basically the same like the display of the rest of the Siemens mobile phones. In the upper line the icons for the state of the device get viewed as well as the indicators of the state of the battery and the operator's network. In the bottom line the functions of the context keys are displayed. The main display is equipped with both the operator's name and the date and time details as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main display without wallpaper ? with wallpaper </paragraph>
			<paragraph>After a moment of inactivity a big digital clock appears on the display. It is fairly easy to see even when the display has gone out. And yet, if only could the standby mode of the display be also seen when the display itself has been closed...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By pressing the central button or the left context button you enter straight into the main menu. Do not be alarmed if a certain degree of horror captures you after having done so. The icons of the main matrix menu are the same as in Siemens S65, with the only difference that they had to be adapted to the smaller size of the display. They are black &amp; white and quite uneven. When selected, the icon picks a golden tint and starts to slightly animate. As it was already mentioned, power lies in simplicity, but the excessive austerity does not seem to be suitable either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main menu ? the wallpaper of the main display viewed as a background ? Setting the shortcuts </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has nine icons, which are not possible to view in a different mode. The rest of the menus are text only. The option of a quick election of various items is not available, but you can assign your favorite functions to individual keys of the numeric keypad or invoke functions using your voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice command option can be brought about by pressing and holding the middle part of the control button. By going upwards you switch the profiles, going down lets you enter the address book, by going right you get into the picture gallery and going left opens the file with the voice notes and the melodies available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Siemens users will take no effort in getting streetwise in the main icon menu. Yet, as soon as they enter into one of the other sections, they will get lost. That is where Philips takes over the control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several complaints regarding the slow reaction of the phone have come up during the testing process, but I would rather leave this problem for later for we better wait until the final version of the phone has been launched.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera and memory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let us go straight for one of the main lures of Siemens SF65 - its megapixel camera. It only gets activated by reversing the display and closing the phone afterwards. If the phone is in an open mode, there is no way for the camera to be switched on. I must admit, however, that as a result the phone feels more firm and is more comfortable to hold when taking pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera's viewfinder and settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two buttons on the right side of the display help manage the digital zoom, the button placed up left helps switch the display to a "stagnant" mode and finally, the left button helps you enter the camera menu. The shutter release button is placed just on the right place on the upper side to be easy accessible. The diode for supplementary lighting gets activated or deactivated by using the volume buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the menu there is an option for viewing pictures, setting the color filters, a function for a night mode and a self-timer function. You can also set three different types of resolution as well as three quality degrees for picture compression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Sample photos from Siemens SF65 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the pictures taken is more or less satisfactory, even though one final touch by the firmware could improve them even more. There is 4x digital zoom, but it just crops a part of the whole frame. Unfortunately, the phone does not allow shooting a video sequence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Digital zoom </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt 21 MB memory does not serve only for saving pictures. It is distributed among pictures, voice notes, melodies and java applications, samples of voice options, the address book and the multimedia and text messages. For each of the items mentioned, however, a fixed amount of memory is assigned; hence we could hardly speak about a fully shared memory. Because of the graphic illustration of each part and the percentage representation of its occupancy the capacity assigned to each part is quite difficult to define.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Details on free memory ? image viewing ? pictures can be edited to a certain extent</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls and short messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone can play 64 channel polyphonic ringtones. However it is a pity that it does not support the favorite MP3 or WAV files. The diode on the front side starts to blink simultaneously with the ringing. The phone can be muted when in a ringing mode. Besides that you can set specific ringing profiles for different environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Ringingc profiles ? sound tuning </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens's fans will probably be very disappointed once they see the address book, because the detailed address book with plenty of items, which they know well from the Series 65, is substituted by an alternative one created by Philips. According to the manufacturer, the address book takes in up to 500 names. Every single contact can contain an assigned name and surname, six different numbers, a note and an e-mail address. Let us confess that the classic Siemens address book comes on the top here. In addition, in the address book of the SF65 model one cannot search by simple consequent writing of the name, but by entering the first character only. After pressing the "#" key you can enter the whole name you are searching for or just its first several characters - just like we know it from Philips. Yet, that is not it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook ? Contact list ? electing a new item </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A specific ringing melody or a picture is not possible to assign directly to a certain contact, but to a group only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the creation of messages is concerned, the Siemens' fans will probably persist in their disappointment. Here once again Philips takes over control. Thus one has to get used to the method of first entering the recipient's number and then writing the message itself as well as to the lack of an indication for the characters left. A note about the number of used space appears just shortly before sending the message. The T9 dictionary is an implied part of the phone's equipment as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as multimedia is concerned, creating a message with Siemens SF65 is relatively easy due to the well-arranged editor. Again it does not allow sending a video and size of a sent message is limited to 50 kB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Writing text messages ? creating and viewing MMS ? access to email </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a simple email client available; two accounts can to be set up. The client makes it possible to receive and send simple messages as well as messages with picture, sound and text attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer and additional functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this Siemens model we will also find the function that seems to be so essential for many of us - the calendar. Here I have to repeat myself and say once again: if you are used to using a Siemens mobile phone, you will feel disappointed. Even though the Philips' calendar is not bad at all, I have to admit that the one created by Siemens offers more - just like its address book and message options. Yet, in a stylish model like SF65 this should not matter that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calendar and possible views </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers a monthly, weekly or daily view. In the monthly view, however, you cannot move from day to day by using the arrows, nor is it that easy to quickly enter a note for the day chosen. Arrows help you shift months only. As for the date of the task, which must be set, you need to memorize it and enter it after you press the confirming button twice. The weekly views work in a similar way as well as the daily ones, as far as the time, which is to be set, is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Events overview ? detail </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows you to choose out of three different types of appointments. You can enter an alarm with timing advance as well as appointments with various frequency of repetition. The appointments in the preview are displayed through an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no task organizer, nor are there text notes. However, you can create voice notes (max 70 s). Of course, there is also an alarm clock available. In the case of Siemens SF65 they are even three with each of them offering an option for a ringing melody to be chosen and a repeated ring to be set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Voice memo ? calculator ? there are three alarm clocks </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the additional functions, we could mention at least the calculator and the indispensable games. The Philips phones' favorers will be pleased to find the already classic "brick" game. A new java game and an application with tips on how to prepare a perfect cocktail of your own have also been installed. Thanks to the 2.0 version Java support you can also download additional games and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Favorite bricks ? java game with marbles ? mix a cocktail on your wish </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for WAP, it is present by definition, here in its 1.2.1. version. GPRS Class 10 serves as a data supplier; EDGE is not present. The phone is equipped to work as a hardware modem, which is to be connected with a computer through infrared port or a data cable. As for Bluetooth, you will not find it in Siemens SF65 either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Awesome, but the price?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The title quite exactly hits everything I wanted to say in conclusion. Siemens SF65 is an extremely interesting stylish mobile phone of a modern design and an attractive construction. The menu influenced by Philips will definitely vex many of the Siemens devoted fans, but it should perfectly suit most of the common mobile phone users. This phone has not been meant for work, so we should tolerate the small disadvantages in the functional menu. What has been perfectly designed is the the camera control application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Siemens SF65' position on the market is concerned, its price seems to be the main obstacle on the way to success. It has climbed up to nearly 400 Euros, which is simply too much. For this money you could get, for example, a brilliantly equipped Samsung D500, which is likewise very attractive, has a megapixel camera, supports MP3, its inbuilt memory is four times bigger than the one of Siemens and supports Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to feel more attracted to the iPod style, then you may rather go for Sagem myX-8, which offers a big display with excellent characteristics, a megapixel camera, supports music and video files, has a memory card slot and also supports (just like the Samsung) Bluetooth. On top of this it costs about 350 Euros. That is why Siemens SF65 should start thinking of lowering the price, provided it is after a success in the sales.</paragraph>
