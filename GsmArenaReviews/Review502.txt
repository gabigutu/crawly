			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartwatches offer few practical uses, have terrible battery life, and are little more than plasticky toys - you've heard the rants. Well, while we're waiting for developments on the first two counts, the Huawei Watch addresses the last one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Universally accepted as the most beautiful smartwatch in existence upon its announcement in March, the Huawei Watch sure took its time to make it to consumers' wrists. Its classical timepiece design is as relevant now as it was on day one, and that's its main allure - the Huawei Watch just looks and feels a lot like a regular watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a few case color options, each with a choice of a leather strap or a steel bracelet and you can grab standard aftermarket replacements and swap them in a matter of seconds with your bare hands, or fingernails, really. Not exactly Motomaker customizability but not strapped (punny...) for options either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the classy surface it's as standard-issue as they come, though. The vast majority of Android smartwatches now are powered by the Snapdragon 400 paired with half a gig of RAM and 4GB of storage, and the Huawei Watch is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the usual features, but nothing extraordinary - dust and water ingress protection, motion and heart rate sensors, vibration. The greatest bit is perhaps the Sapphire crystal glass - an exclusive feature outside of the Apple realm (where it doesn't come cheap, either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price to pay for having the classiest smartwatch is certainly a pretty steep one. For the same amount of cash you can easily get a pretty good Swiss-made regular watch, which unlike the Huawei Watch won't be obsolete within a year. Or ten.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're also quite bummed by the lack of an ambient light sensor. The claim for design considerations doesn't really stand - both Apple and Samsung have implemented one underneath the display without spoiling the looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then comes the issue of what you can actually do with a smartwatch. The fact that the Huawei Watch is marketed more as a dress watch doesn't help either - you won't be pumping iron with the same timepiece you'd be taking to the restaurant in the evening, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all these thoughts battling inside our heads, we kick off our review of the Huawei Watch, starting with unboxing and hardware overview on the following page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exquisite presentation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A lot has been written about the Huawei Watch' retail package and we'll reiterate - it's extraordinary as smartwatches go, and could just as well contain a luxury mechanical watch. A box inside a box, plenty of high-quality faux leather, a soft cushion to hold the watch itself - it all works together to make for a wonderful first impression even before you get to hold the timepiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside you'll find an AC adapter and a magnetic charging dock. We have a few issues with the dock, and they're so obvious that it's puzzling why Huawei decided to do things this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the dock and its USB cable are a one-piece affair, meaning you can't just use the same USB-to-microUSB cable to charge you're your phone and the Watch, and carry just the dock when going places - you'd be carrying the dock's cable as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the one-piece solution means that should you damage the cable, the dock becomes useless, and at $40 a pop, replacement docks aren't exactly cheap (also not yet available). The cable is reinforced at its point of entry into the dock, but still. Huawei has also missed the opportunity to make the dock into a night stand like Motorola has done with the Moto 360 or Samsung with the Gear S2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another gripe we have is that it's all too easy to put the watch on the charger, and it would magnetically lock into place but wouldn't charge. On more than one occasion we left the Watch on the charger, only to find it hadn't been charging at all. You need to make sure the contacts are properly aligned every time you put the watch on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch gas gotten a fair share of praise for being the most beautiful smartwatch there is right now, and subjective as it may be, we're inclined to agree. Classical mechanical watch looks are the route to mainstream smartwatch adoption and Huawei was first to get it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, in the time frame between the Huawei Watch announcement and market launch (a good 6 months), Motorola had caught up and updated the Moto 360. Still, Huawei's design remains a top pick if you're after a smartwatch with a regular wrist watch look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch comes in a choice of styles for its stainless steel case each paired with a specific bracelet/strap. Our review unit has the plain stainless steel case and a stainless steel bracelet, but the same case can be paired with a classic black leather band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A different style of leather band without stitches comes with a black stainless steel case with hour markings - the same case goes with a black stainless steel bracelet too. Then there's the rose gold plated edition, with a choice of either leather (alligator patterned), or gold plated stainless steel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our unit we have here, which is one of the more affordable options (by comparison, not in any way cheap in absolute terms). The stainless steel case is brushed on the sides, while the lugs and bezel are polished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two sides to this, the positive being that the two finishes give you more options for aftermarket bracelets. The down side is that previous experience on traditional watches has seen polished elements take dings and scratches with less grace than brushed ones. That said, we didn't manage to scratch either part during our use of the Huawei Watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The case itself is 42mm in diameter aiming to be a god fit for the majority of wrists. It's been often criticized for being too thick, and 11.3mm might sound like it at first. However, traditional mechanical watches aren't too thin either - the revered Omega Seamaster is 13mm thick in its most common versions (of which admittedly there's a huge number). Dress watches from the mechanical age are a couple of millimeters thinner, with only ultra-expensive specialty designs going into single-digit thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has nonetheless taken measures to mask the Watch' thickness by making the bottom cover a millimeter smaller in diameter. Add to that the polished bezel and the side of the watch looks about 8mm thick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sapphire crystal front glass, which is hard enough on its own, is also recessed a fraction of a millimeter below the bezel. Theoretically, that should help in keeping the glass in one piece and scratch-free. The downside to Sapphire is that it's very reflective, and while that's a non-issue for a mechanical watch, on a smartwatch it hinders outdoor visibility in bright sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The off-center crown is another polarizing feature of the Huawei Watch. Some insist that the classic 3-o'clock position should have been used, but at 2-o'clock it's arguably better suited for access with the forefinger of either hand, thus making the Watch equally comfortable to use on both wrists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, the crown clicks nicely when pressed, though it could have had a bit more travel. It also rotates, without any functionality tied to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of steel as well, with a circular glass insert for the heart-rate sensor. There's also a cutout for the four-pin charging port. The whole thing is IP67 certified for dust and water resistance, but you need to make sure the charging port is dry before putting the watch on the dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bracelet on our review unit features a push-button hidden clasp, which keeps it securely in place. The links are perhaps a touch too fine for our taste, but that brings the added benefit of precise adjustments. You can also swap the included piece with your choice of standard 18mm bracelets or leather bands - Huawei has also made the removal nice and simple without any tools required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight is yet another subjective topic. Switching from a 130-something-gram (not a monster in its own right) stainless steel analog watch to the featherweight smartband-like Samsung Gear S2 required adjustment, but the Huawei Watch immediately fell into place. A leather strap version will obviously be lighter, but then an analog counterpart would be lighter as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Huawei watch is one fine timepiece with craftsmanship on par with a similarly priced traditional watch. As such it looks and feels of higher quality than the majority of smartwatch offerings out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>AMOLED display shows its strengths, hardware constraints contribute flaws<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch has a 1.4-inch AMOLED display with 400x400 pixel resolution. A density of 286ppi means it's not quite as sharp as the 302ppi smaller 1.2-inch 360x360 pixel display of the Samsung Gear S2, but is sharper than either size of the Moto 360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the numbers. The reality is that at anything closer than 25cm you'd be seeing the diamond pentile subpixel arrangement. Indeed, that holds true almost exclusively for white backgrounds, and having an AMOLED smartwatch is all about them blacks. The thing is that Android Wear displays its menus and notifications in white and there's no going around that, no matter what watch face you select.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could argue that 20cm is much too close a distance to be looking at a watch face, but when it's a smartwatch, you will need to read some seriously tiny text and you'd be sticking your nose into that thing quite often. All that said, the good thing is that the perceivable effect of this issue wears off quickly after you switch from inspecting to actually using the Watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's harder to live with, again for light backgrounds, is how the glass bevel around the edge magnifies the subpixels making them easily visible. The effect is present when viewing head-on, as well as at an angle - pretty much all the time. To reiterate - dark watch faces don't suffer from this at all, it's white ones and the menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another gripe we have with the Huawei Watch is that it doesn't have an ambient light sensor, and consecutively an auto brightness mode. The way we see it, it's an essential feature for a smartwatch and the sole reason not to include one was probably not to spoil the classic design. Both Apple and Samsung (on the Gear S2) went with a behind-the-display solution, so it can be done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery lasts comfortably through the day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch draws power from a 300mAh battery, which is obviously not readily replaceable. Capacity is the same as the similarly sized 42mm Moto 360 (2nd gen), but smaller than the 410mAh of the LG G Watch R with its 1.3-inch display. The Samsung Gear S2 is both smaller in diameter, has a different chipset and runs another OS, while packing a 250mAh cell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course all this number crunching makes little sense in the real world. Devising a truly objective standardized battery test for smartwatches is impossible for now, so a reviewer is only left to detail their usage and observations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the list goes like this. A nearly incessant stream of Viber notifications as part of a 7-member group where someone always has something to say, plus a significant other who does too, as well as half a dozen emails, and 2-3 voice calls was the smartwatch's daily diet for the period of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Watch was paired to a phone via Bluetooth only - Wi-Fi was switched off. Brightness was set to 3 out of 5 and the Always On mode was enabled. Watch faces were frequently changed, but since most of the time the Watch is in the Always On state, as opposed to full-on color watch face, that doesn't seem to make all that much of a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fit and Daily tracking apps were constantly doing their thing, tracking steps and active times and whatnot. A couple of alarms each morning would often vibrate for several minutes too. The heart-rate sensor wasn't extensively used (2-3 times a day), nor were actual workouts monitored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under this pattern of use, the Huawei Watch lasted through an entire day, and still had double digits of juice when the alarm went off around 8 on the next morning. Now, you'd argue that overnight charging is the way to go, but having the vibrating alarm wake you up in the morning without disturbing the significant other is a top feature to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And also, if you spend some time around the house in the mornings instead of shooting straight out for work, the Watch will have enough time to get back to full charge and be ready for another round of the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you might establish your own entirely different pattern, the point is that the Watch can last a busy 24-hour day. And it's not like that's exactly praiseworthy - that's just the way smartwatches still are.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Wear is a standard affair<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch runs on Android Wear, Google's platform for wearables. Unlike the Android smartphone realm, the interface on all smartwatches is almost entirely identical. That said, a certain form of fragmentation is also present here - Android Wear v1.4 has already been released bringing a host of new gestures, but our Huawei Watch is still on v1.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch face is the lockscreen (if you allow the analogy) and swiping to the left takes you to the app drawer of sorts. The apps are organized in a single list with the three most recently used ones on top, the rest following in alphabetical order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another swipe to the left lists your contacts, while a third one takes you to Google voice search. You can shout out voice commands to your smartwatch or tap to take notes, send messages, set a timer and other useful actions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the top pulls down a notification shade of sorts, which contains a few screens with quick toggles and a shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actual notifications appear on the bottom, occupying about a third of the watch face's height. You swipe up to expand to fullscreen, and further swipes cycle through all the available notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Wear has added a bunch of new gestures in v1.4, which we can't show you, because our Huawei Watch only has the two ones already available on v1.3. You just flick your wrist up or down to scroll through notifications. Sadly, this doesn't work in the menus or any apps, but it is quite convenient for reviewing your notifications almost hands-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu gives you control over brightness (1 to 5, and no Auto), font size (small, normal, large), connectivity options (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Airplane mode), the lot. You can also change watch faces from here, but you're likely to prefer the usual long press on the watch face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Accessibility feature, which currently only contains a toggle for triple-tap magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Draw emoji feature, where you can doodle a simple shape on the screen and Wear will suggests a few emoticons that might match what you're trying to achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda app is pretty self-explanatory. It pulls your calendar items and lets you browse. Sadly, there is still no way to add a task from the app itself. This, however, can be done via a voice command and, seeing how you don't really have any way to type it out, the decision is all but justified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other familiar features include a timer and an alarm app, both with nothing really new to offer. Naturally, you can also ping to locate your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another neat little trick is the added flashlight feature. All it does is blast the brightness and set a white background on the watch, but it is pretty convenient for getting around in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch is clearly not geared towards active sports use, instead placing its focus on looks. That said, it still has the usual set of fitness tracking features - a pedometer and a heart-rate sensor are both available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Fit integration is readily available and practically always on - the device is constantly keeping track of your steps. The Google Fit app itself is unchanged, but it really doesn't need to be as it already does what it sets out to achieve. For the most part, it is independent from your phone and doesn't even need its full Android counterpart installed on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daily tracking is Huawei's Fit counterpart. It displays today's number of steps, calories burnt, and also the number of times you stood up from your chair. That last one might have been useful to those who work in an office all day, if it was any close to reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set it track a specific exercise and set either a time or a calorie goal. There's a dedicated heart rate measurement app, which can also keep a record of previous measurements.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Watch key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Superb build quality, analog watch looks; aftermarket standard 18mm bracelets can be used for added customizability</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display has deep AMOLED blacks and decent brightness, but sapphire crystal hurts its visibility in bright daylight. You can still tell the time just fine, though, even at oblique angles. White backgrounds reveal the diamond pentile matrix if you look up close, and also show magnified subpixels around the beveled glass edge. Dark backgrounds don't suffer and look great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery lasts through a 24-hour day with no worries. A charger dock could have been conceptually better (night stand?), but its realization is flawed as it is, often leading to a hassle about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot of stylish watch faces are preinstalled, few of them offer customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Wear has the same functionality across devices - notifications are its forte, voice recognition works okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Android Wear v1.4 hadn't yet made its way to the Huawei Watch, so we couldn't test the new gestures. Apparently the issue of OS fragmentation will be just as pressing on wearables as it is on phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of activity tracking apps are on board, you can add your own, but the essence is the same - step tracking, on-demand hear rate measurement, calorie calculations based on activity, age and body properties.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can't not love the Hauwei Watch. The Chinese struck gold by going the obvious route, which others seemed to avoid. Make a smartwatch look like an analog watch and you'd be sure to entice not just the geeky folk, but the general public too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditional shapes, high-quality materials, and fine craftsmanship are not what you would have associated with the first endeavors in the smartwatch world. But we're slowly getting there and it's Huawei that is leading the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The universal appeal of the Huawei Watch is undeniable, but pricing is prohibitive. A device, which in its base model costs as much as a solid midrange smartphone, and its chief use is to complement one, is a tough sell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it's nice to have notifications delivered to your wrist and there are even cases when it's genuinely useful. It's also hard to deny the fashion benefits of being able to tailor your watch face to your outfit in a matter of seconds. In that sense, a smartwatch is actually great value - stocking up on as many styles of analog watches as possible is perhaps not as cost-effective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's hard to rationalize around is the fact that within a couple of years your Huawei Watch is going to be obsolete. That's true for any smartwatch but it's a fact we're reminded of ever more intensely at this budget. A traditional timepiece will have accumulated a few scratches, but will be good for another decade, even if you're not the overly careful type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, the Motorola Moto 360 (2nd gen). With a base price of $50 less than the Huawei Watch, the similarly sized 42mm model offers better value for money (even more so in Europe where the price difference is even bigger). You have to be able to live with the flat tire screen, though, and the Moto's ambient (always-on) mode displays a rather coarse rendering of the watch face. You can get a 46mm model for larger wrists, unlike the Huawei Watch, which is 42mm-only. No sapphire on either size Moto, which may be worth considering if you're not particularly careful with your timepieces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S2 Classic is Samsung's entry in the dress smartwatch space. It is smaller, so would better fit gentler wrists. It's also not Android Wear, but Tizen instead, and is thus more feature-rich. There's also that rotating bezel and double the number of buttons so it offers more varied ways of interaction. There's little to nothing to split the difference between the two in terms of price (for a comparable leather-strapped Huawei Watch, that is), so it's largely a subjective decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Watch Urbane is cheaper than the Huawei Watch pretty much wherever you reside, but is mostly the same in terms of functionality. What it lacks is the Huawei Watch' classy looks, instead being a bulky block of metal with huge lugs. No sapphire on this one either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're over at Apple camp and want to stay there with your smartwatch (because Android Wear watches can now work decently with iPhones), a dressier leather-band Apple Watch in 42mm size will set you back a good $700 - twice the leather-equipped Huawei Watch. You'd be getting a sapphire glass too, and Force touch on top of that. And also a richer experience thanks to the better interaction between your smartwatch and phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then if you just want to make sure whether a smartwatch is for you at all, before shelling out the cash for one of the expensive bunch, you could pick a first-gen Moto 360 for about $150/?150. It lacks Wi-Fi, has an inferior processor and lower display resolution, but will push notifications equally well. Another option in the same category is the Asus Zenwatch 2 - it's not the best looking one by any stretch of the imagination, but it won't break the bank, and it also comes in two sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom line is that if you're familiar with what to expect from a smartwatch today, the Huawei Watch is a great one. It looks marvelous, has a nice display with fancy watch faces, and won't call it quits in the middle of the day no matter how popular you are. But for all its objective strengths, the Huawei Watch speaks most convincingly to the fashion-conscious buyer with money to spare.</paragraph>
