		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are about to explore the Xperia M2, a smartphone with an agenda of its own. Task number 1 is to upgrade the popular Xperia M. Check. The M2 brings a bigger screen (and ups the resolution), the chipset is better and the camera resolution is higher. The M2 also adds LTE and a higher battery capacity. Task number 2 is to give Sony an extra bit of quality against the likes of Moto G. We'll see about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony are busy adding number tags to model names, which doesn't speak highly of their copywriting skills, but the upgrades have so far been - at the very least - solid. We've seen the new season's flagships, phone and tablet, and the budget-friendly Xperia E1. The same applies to the Xperia M2 just as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony fans have grown accustomed to getting high build quality and great looks regardless of the price range. The Xperia M2 readily delivers - but pays due attention to the innards as well. It adds a couple of extra CPU cores to what the original Xperia M has. The Snapdragon 400 chipset represents a good balance between price and performance. A 4.8" qHD screen, 8MP stills and 1080p videos, and rich connectivity options are also on the spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 sounds quite convincing on paper. A modern midranger, almost by the book. The OmniBalance design Sony introduced with the Xperia Z back in 2013 rules out a removable battery, but we guess that's the price to pay for looks and feel above the pay grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of KitKat will likely be sorted soon enough - the Xperia M2 update is already in development and should be out in the summer. That leaves us with the issue of screen resolution. Now qHD certainly sounds on the low side when spread across a 4.8" diagonal but the truth is, it's probably enough for many. We are sure a lot of you will go for size over pixel density - especially at the right price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get to that but first things first. Take the jump to our hardware checkup.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia M2 retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The roomy retail box of the Sony Xperia M2 covers just the basics in the shape of an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and a headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia M2 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a bigger screen to show for it, the Sony Xperia M2 is obviously taller than the original Xperia M. It stands at 139.7 x 71.1 x 8.6mm and weighs a solid 148g. This is very close in fact to the dual-SIM five-incher, the Xperia C.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not just the size actually, the two handsets have quite a lot in common. Sony has keept the OmniBalance design for a second generation in a row now and it still does the job quite well. What the Xperia M2 lacks compared to the Xperia C is a removable battery cover, and therefore a user-accessible battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What looks like glass on both sides, is actually a pretty close resemblance but the Sony was obviously mindful of the budget. A closer inspection reveals the rear is actually made of extra glossy black polycarbonate. It's so reflective it can almost replace a mirror. The downside of this finish is it would get covered in smudges if you even so much as look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 comes with a 4.8" display, which HTC might try to sell to you as a mini next year. It isn't the most compact smartphone around, but not impossible to operate single-handedly. The Xperia M2's matte sides provide at least some sort of proper grip, which is more than welcome considering the super slippery rear finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 has a 4.8" LCD display of qHD resolution (540 x 960px) for a decent, even if hardly spectacular, 229ppi sharpness. It is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3, though the absence of oleophobic coating makes fingerprints a problem. The surface is not as easy to clean as we would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering looks okay, but the white balance is on the cold side meaning there is a subtle bluish tint. On this smartphone the side viewing angles are OK, with little loss of contrast and color shift when you are not looking at the screen head on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 RGB display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall image quality is quite decent, the display is very bright and the contrast is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front display glass is quite reflective too, making the screen hard to read in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 has pretty much the same controls as most of the Xperia smartphones released over the past year or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the VGA camera, a couple of sensors, the earpiece and a small status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features a short LED strip that lights up when you are watching a video or you are checking out the photos in the gallery. The LED strip matches the color of screen's content but it's really too short to make a difference in the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The uncovered microUSB port is a loner on the left, while the micro SIM and micro SD slots are under a plastic lid on the right, followed by the signature Xperia power/lock key, the thin volume rocker and the camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on the top, as usual. The bottom of the Xperia M2 seems empty, but in fact the primary microphone and the loudspeaker are hiding behind a fine grille. The lanyard eyelet is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2's glossy back has the 8MP camera lens along with a single LED flash. The secondary microphone is right next to the LED flash too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has put a 2300mAh battery inside the Xperia M2, up from 1750mAh in the previous version. We ran our battery test routine with the battery-saving STAMINA mode off. It scored 64 hours, which means you can count on just shy of 3 days if you do an hour each of talk-time, web browsing and playing video per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Sony Xperia M2 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 is available in single and dual SIM versions. The single SIM variety has three distinct versions for different markets. Here's the list of supported bands by model:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM-enabled Xperia M2 supports dual stand-by and is one of the few phones that allows you to talk on one SIM and still receive calls on the other. You can even put the first call on hold and then answer the second incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual SIM smartphones come with many advantages. They allow you to separate work from play and handle your calls more cost-efficiently. Plus, with our new dual SIM feature, you can keep both SIM cards active at all times - so you can talk on one SIM, and still receive calls on the other, instead of getting a voicemail. This gives you the option of putting the first call on hold while answering the one coming in. And as a result, you'll never miss a call. You activate the dual SIM feature when you set up your phone. If you add your second SIM card later, you can always access the setup guide from the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features available across all models include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also NFC connectivity with support for Android Beam for sending files to other Android devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol, which is usually used for connecting to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port can also be used in USB On-the-go mode for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or real USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, but if own a compatible HDTV, you can output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 comes with Android 4.3 out of the box, while the company has promised the Android 4.4 KitKat update is already in the works. The software package looks very much the same whatever the Android version and that's why everything would feel and seem so familiar if you've ever used a recent Sony smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), while the rightmost pane will fire up the camera. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store. Also third party apps oftentimes come with their own set of extra widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 lets you add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff on the homescreen is easy, as it is the customization. You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search apps and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia M2 and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is buttery smooth, there is no visible lag or long loading times. The Sony launcher is lightweight and, combined with the snappy chipset, you'll get great UI experience. The upcoming Android 4.4 KitKat and its optimizations might even make things even faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 is running on the Snapdragon 400 mid-range chipset. It offers four Cortex-A7 CPU cores, Adreno 305 graphics and 1GB of RAM. We've already seen the S400 in action on the Motorola Moto G, the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra, the HTC Desire 816, the HTC One mini 2 and several others so it's clearly a quite popular choice. And rightfully so as it delivers a snappy performance in everyday use and quite acceptable gaming as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Xperia M2 posted an OK result on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. While the score pales in comparison to the latest Krait processors, the Xperia M2 matched the performance of the Moto G and Xperia C and bettered that of the first-gen Krait and Cortex-A9 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. The Xperia M2 numbers are quite good, slightly better than the quad-core Cortex-A7-powered Moto G, much better than the Xperia C, but below the Xperia T2 Ultra.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall score and the dedicated CPU scores. The Sony Xperia M2 overall rating is quite poor, but the singe-core and multi-core performance put it very close to the Snapdragon 400-powered HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results didn't come out peachy. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some very poor performance. It did better on the on-screen tests than the Xperia T2 Ultra, which has the same chipset but packs a higher resolution 720p display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BrowserMark 2.1 tests HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Sony Xperia M2 managed a good score in BrowserMark but rather poor in Kraken.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 and its powered Snapdragon 400 chipset offer good overall performance, though the GPU benchmarks are quite uninspiring. What's really matters is real-life usage and it is great. The Android OS is as smooth as butter with no lag whatsoever, while most of the popular games run just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia M2 was nothing short of pleasing. There is noise-cancelling options that is on by default, but you can turn it off from Settings. There is also a Slow Talk option, which will actively slow the speech of the other calling party. You can even apply equalizer settings to the voice call sound, but you can choose only between Normal, Bright and Smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are unlikely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made very little to no difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia M2 offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard, which is very enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One-handed keyboard is available too, only in portrait orientation. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Updated Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 ultra notified us for an Album gallery update once we configured our accounts. After the updated we got the same app that comes pre-installed on the KitKat-running Xperia Z2. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same swipe-able menu the app drawer is offering. There you can find all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies video player does OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does play 1080p files but only as long as those are XviD AVI files, as well as MP4 and MKV files. However DTS and AC3 audio tracks are not supported, which makes the MKV compatibility rather questionable. We know you can always get a proper app from the Play Store but it's a shame you can't just use the eye-candy default player for everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the video player supports subtitles, and you can customize their looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you cannot manually pick the subtitle file, it has to reside in the video folder to load up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman gets an update too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player got updated with the Album app upon the phone's initial setup too and is now the same the Xperia Z2 has. It is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and Track ID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app offers multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 did well in both parts of our audio quality test as far as the cleanliness of its output is concerned. It demonstrated spot-on frequency response and there was no distortion in either case. The noise level and dynamic range, while not the best, are still excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problems with the performance of the Xperia M2 were (1) the rather large bump in stereo crosstalk when we plugged in a pair of headphones and (2) the very low volume levels in both parts. You probably won't listen to anything at maximum volume with the stock headphones (in fact the smartphone will warn you against doing that), but if you have another pro-grade pair, that might turn out to be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring 8MP autofocus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2's camera uses one of Sony's standard-issue 8MP Exmor RS sensor. It shoots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels (8MP) in manual mode, or 3104 x 1746 (5.4MP) in Superior Auto. There is also a LED flash to help you with some low-light photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 also has a hardware shutter key. It's quite tiny and many people would probably find it uncomfortable. The good thing about it is that you can set it up to unlock the phone and start the camera. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you want to capture something quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes most of the times. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full resolution Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones - in this case it limits photos to 5.4MP resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. There are no settings you can change, everything here happens done automagically. Unlike the 20MP Sony Xperia phones, the images taken with Superior Auto have the same quality as the one shot in Normal (Manual) mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia M2 offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, unfortunately, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution, lousy stitching and uninspiring quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 30 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Background defocus - it take a photo of a particular subject and then blurs the background behind it. Sounds like a nice thing on paper, but it fails quite often and you need to try again and again, and keep as steady as possible while shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both 8MP full resolution samples and the 5.4MP ones taken in Superior Auto have an underwhelming level of resolved detail when viewed at 1:1 magnification. The exposure, contrast and colors are good, which makes for nice looking photos when you view them fit on your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 8MP shots we've snapped:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few samples taken in Superior Auto mode. They have the same quality as the 8MP ones, but are shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Superior Auto would occasionally activate the HDR mode when it decides it's needed, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode and enable it from the Scenes menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without going to extremes. Unfortunately the resolved is even worse than the standard samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of HDR samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps. The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the M2 features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an HDR option, as well as various preset scenes to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2's 1080p samples are nothing to rave about, but they are still better than the still images. The resolved detail is better, the noise reduction isn't that destructive and there is very little noise. The frame rate is steady at 28 fps, while the bitrate is good at 16-17Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 128 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers too often as on other Xperia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 is also capable of capturing 1080p@30fps HDR videos. The quality is the same as the standard video samples, the HDR effect is visible, and sometimes way too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out the HDR samples we've uploaded on YouTube as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 captures mediocre 1080p videos. It also manages to resolve good detail in the background in good light conditions, but fails to do so in the foreground. There is lots of noise in the low-light scene, though the lack of a harsh noise reduction algorithm allows for keeping more detail. You can check out how it does against the competition in good and low lighting conditions and look at the ISO chart for a synthetic estimation of the resolved detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is your internet gateway<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups. Reduce data usage does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 also features the Office Suite 7, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and Notes app are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and its more thumbable Navigation counterpart are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS/GLONASS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are most useful when you use them while you are online. Google Maps allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection but you can't search for addresses or POIs without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. It can also display pretty accurate traffic alerts as well (though it doesn't always take them into account when routing you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool is Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices linked to your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced device by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data. You have to enable the remote locking initially via the pre-installed Google Settings app on your smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 is the essence of a mid-range smartphone - it's got a big display with modest resolution, a Snapdragon 400 chipset with an ok quad-core processor, an uninspiring 8MP camera all that wrapped up in a seriously attractive slim body. It's like a smaller version of the Xperia T2 Ultra and a bigger flavor of the Xperia E1. It doesn't excel in anything but it doesn't fail in anything either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are actually a lot of positive things about it. It is a real looker thanks to the iconic Xperia design. It offers a snappy hardware and a big screen, which add for great multimedia experience. It comes with LTE connectivity too, but you can also exchange the LTE for dual-SIM capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has been updating most of its popular phones to Android 4.4 KitKat lately and the Xperia M2 will be getting the same treatment. This will surely make the handset even snappier than it is now, further enhancing the overall user experience. But even without the KitKat optimizations, Sony has already begun updating its system apps to the latest available versions as seen on their KitKat phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've put the Sony Xperia M2 through our regular battery of tests and the only thing that left a bitter taste in our proverbial mouth was the subpar camera performance. Everything else was right down there in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia M2 key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 may not be the best mid-range droid out there, but nobody's perfect. As usual, we suggest a look at the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia C is an excellent alternative from Sony's own lineup - it comes with a .2" bigger display with the same qHD resolution, the same quad-core Cortex-A7 processor, and even the camera is 8MP. What's more, the Xperia C is a few bucks cheaper, it offers dual-SIM options by default, but has less internal storage and may never see KitKat treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently upgraded Motorola Moto G 4G with LTE connectivity and a microSD card slot is a real threat to the Xperia M2. The Moto G comes with a 4.5" IPS 720p display, a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a 5MP rear camera with 720p video recording. It runs on a vanilla Android 4.4 KitKat and Motorola has promised timely Android updates. The Moto G 4G costs about ?100 cheaper, which is as tempting as it can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L90 and LG G2 mini are virtually identical sans the Android controls, which the G2 mini puts on its back just below the camera. Both LG smartphones are boasting 4.7" qHD IPS displays, Snadpragon 400 chipsets and 8MP cameras - a perfect match of the Sony Xperia M2. Both are running on KitKat skinned with LG's latest Optimus UI with Knock Code. The LG L90 is cheaper, while the G2 mini's rear control deck will cost you the same as the Xperia M2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG L90 D405 ? LG G2 mini LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy S4 mini comes in LTE and dual-SIM flavors too. It is powered by the older-gen Snapdragon 400 chipset with a dual-core Krait processor, it has a Super AMOLED 4.3" qHD display and will soon taste Android 4.4 KitKat with the last TouchWiz UI optimizations. If you are a fan of Samsung's way of handling Android, maybe you should check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo R819 is still quite an attractive purchase with its superior IPS 720p display, MT6589 quad-core chipset of similar capabilities, and dual-SIM connectivity. Unfortunately it comes with a non-expandable 16GB internal storage, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo R819</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 is the most economical alternative the Windows Phone gang has at this screen size and it is a lot cheaper. Its processing power isn't as good as the Xperia M2 plus it has a lower-res display, but we found it matches the LTE capabilities and the smooth performance the Xperia M2 delivers. It will get even better this summer when the Windows Phone 8.1 kicks off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 625</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is the Sony Xperia M2 the midranger to rule them all? Hardly. But it is certainly one very well rounded package and most of all, thanks to the iconic Xperia design, it's a smartphone with real character, a rarity in the midrange sea of plastic phones. If the lesser camera quality is not a deal-breaker for you, it certainly won't let you down on every other count.</paragraph>
