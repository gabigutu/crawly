			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is no protocol droid, no phone made for walks in the park. It?s the Motorola DEFY and it isn?t afraid of what comes next. Good. Coming up is one of our reviews. And we?re having the pleasure of the first and only ruggedized Android GSM phone. It?s finally beginning to make sense ? droids are dustproof, scratch and water-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait a minute. That?s on the outside. Under layers of rubber and muscle, the DEFY is a true smartphone, a socialist and an entertainer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surviving scratches, falls and splashes is a full-time job but the Motorola DEFY promises to keep you connected too. Whether you friend or defriend, your social life is a tap away on one of those pixel-rich WVGA screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, it?s a pretty standard Android package with all the connectivity options duly covered and good enough media support. Good-looking, social, smart and durable ? this mid-ranger seems to have more boxes ticked than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY has the most recent version of the MOTOBLUR UI but the actual OS is only getting older. This phone is still stuck on Éclair while the hungry smartphone crowd has its eyes on more tempting Froyo or even Gingerbread, which is just around the corner. But Motorola are making no promises about getting the DEFY suited up with a Froyo update any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you choose to wait in the company of a Motorola DEFY, you?re unlikely to get bored or disappointed. It?s tough when it needs to be but not in the sense of aggressive ? let alone difficult. It?s a phone that knows its limits too. If you know up front what to expect, it should be a fair deal. After all, the Motorola DEFY isn?t charging a fortune.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, there?s no reason for us to wait. Hop on and let the unboxing begin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Motorola DEFY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself as well as a few standard-issue accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for charging and data connections) and a set of earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found a few leaflets explaining that you should not submerge the phone in water with all of its lids open. There was also a quick user guide and the complimentary 2GB microSD card was already placed in the device?s card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola DEFY 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unboxing the DEFY, we were pleasantly surprised with how compact this handset was (especially for a rugged full-touch smartphone). It has the same 3.7? display as the MILESTONE but is remarkably smaller than its QWERTY-enabled sibling, measuring only 107 x 59 x 13.4 mm and weighing 118 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the days of the chunky, heavy and plain ugly rugged phones are over it seems. Here comes the DEFY ? tough, yet pocketable, comfortable to handle and pleasing to the eye.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY is the first of its kind ? a rugged Android smartphone. The phone was first said to meet IP67 standards but Motorola eventually decided to not give any specific protection ratings. In official promos, the DEFY is still touted as dustproof, scratch and splash-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is pretty much the same as what the IP67 certification stands for anyway (dustproof and capable of withstanding immersion of up to 1m) but obviously the company doesn't want to be held responsible for any phones ending up drowned or stuffed full of dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did not to test the survival instincts of our DEFY so we can only advise you to strictly follow Motorola?s instructions if you don?t want to void your warranty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said that, we can still explore all the other aspects of the phone?s design and construction. As we just mentioned, the handset is actually way smaller than it appears in pictures and more refined than you?d expect a rugged device to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DEFY comes in two flavors ? all-black and white on black (T-Mobile USA offers only the white combo). The latter looks quite unusual and certainly isn?t everyone?s cup of tea ? but the all-black model looks great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is taken up by the touchscreen and the 4 capacitive buttons underneath. The black frame that goes around the screen is reinforced by screws that seem to hold the two halves of the phone?s body together. The upper half (screen and frame) is very prone to smudges but quite easy to clean using a soft cloth. The lower sides and the back have soft rubbery finish that?s fingerprint proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY?s screen is smaller that that of the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S and a bit larger than the iPhone 4?s. Quite remarkably though, the DEFY is the most compact phone of the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the Motorola DEFY comes with a 3.7? 16M-color capacitive touchscreen of WVGA resolution (480 x 854 pixels), which is covered by a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass. The image quality is fine with reasonably good-looking blacks (though no Super AMOLED deep) and wide brightness range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles looked quite good indoors and we did expect to be impressed by the screen?s sunlight legibility. However, the screen tends to reflect a bit too much light making it hard to use the phone on a bright sunny day. The screen sensitivity is excellent and multi-touch support is, of course, enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are four capacitive controls: Menu, Home, Back and Search. They're haptic enabled and very sensitive, so the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless. Right below the Search key you might notice the tiny, nearly invisible mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a status LED, the earpiece, as well as proximity and ambient light sensor. The auto-brightness can be disabled if you prefer. The proximity sensor is in charge of locking the display when you hold it next to your ear during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side we find the microUSB sealed with a rubber cap to keep moist and dust away. On the right is the volume rocker. There is no dedicated camera key so you?ll have to rely on the on-screen shutter. By the way, the screws on the phone?s sides and bottom do look tough and strong but they tend to accumulate dirt so you need to clean them occasionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the screen lock key which also acts as a power button. It?s small and barely protrudes but we guess it was done on purpose to minimize accidental presses. Next to it is the standard 3.5mm audio jack covered with its own protective flap. The bottom is completely bare (save for the last of the screws).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone features the 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens and the LED flash placed nearby. As for the loudspeaker grill, it?s also on the back but only gets visible once the battery cover is removed. The camera lens is not covered but is quite recessed, giving it a reasonable protection against scratches (but not against dust).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1540mAh battery. To get to the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment you need to remove the battery first. The memory card isn?t hot-swap enabled but that?s understandable in rugged handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY is powered by a promising Li-Ion battery quoted at up to 238 hours of standby and 6 hours 48 minutes of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY fits snugly in the palm and looks more polished than most rugged phones. The compact size has not affected the screen estate. The DEFY?s 3.7? screen is probably the biggest they could?ve used in a phone this size. The comfortably curved back and soft rubbery finish make the phone nice and secure to hold. Those few millimeters of extra thickness are the price you pay for having a rugged phone. The build is rock solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t obviously test the actual ruggedness claims but we have no reason to complain about the look and feel of this phone. The lack of official IP certification is something to consider but it?s also worth noting that rugged smartphones are hard to come by.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Eclair with MOTOBLUR filling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The DEFY comes with Android 2.1 Eclair and Motorola?s social-networking engine, MOTOBLUR. A few differences and minor functional and visual upgrades is what sets it apart from previous Moto-blurred droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, here?s a video of the Motorola DEFY and the MOTOBLUR interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola have kept the cornerstone of Android ? the homescreen ? but they?ve laced it with social networking integration. This is done mostly through widgets, so if you?ve used Android before you?ll get the hang of it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven homescreen panes so you have plenty of room for widgets. When scrolling the homescreens, dots appear on the top of the screen to assist navigation, though there?s no thumbnail overview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few handy shortcuts are available through the Home key ? a single tap brings you to the center screen and if you?re already there, it launches the main menu. A double tap can launch an app ? which one you can choose from the settings (browser, camera, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts and folders have been part of the Android homescreen from the very start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are the bread and butter of the homescreen. And Motorola have worked some of their mojo to add excellent social networking and make the widgets resizable. Tap and hold on a widget and four handles will appear in the corners ? you can drag them to resize the widget, which will change its appearance to fit the new size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, the Date and Time widget can be expanded to show a clock and a calendar or shrunk to time and date or even all the way down to just a clock. With this much flexibility, you can take the most out of what initially seems like a small and limiting screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Google widgets are missing ? you get the ones from MOTOBLUR instead. But you can be sure, they are more than enough. There are Social and Status widgets, Messages, Quick Contacts, Weather, Radio Switches, RSS Reader, Connected Player controls, Sticky Notes and various application shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather widget shows the forecast for a pre-selected city. It can be expanded to show highs and lows in addition to the weather icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sticky Notes widget allows you to put some notes in different colors on the homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign single or double quick contacts. The single ones are as simple as a contact photo (you tap to email, text or call), while the doubles contain two shortcut buttons below the picture. There is an option for one-touch dialing too (it will ask you the first time when you tap on the quick contact).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social widgets have a dedicated chapter coming up, while the rest of them are pretty much standard. It?s worth repeating perhaps that all of the widgets can be resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is intact. It shows status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the Motorola DEFY you press and hold the Home key, just like on any other Android phone. The task switcher is a shortcut to access six of the most recently used apps, but it?s not a task manager per se.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, Android automatically opens and closes applications. When resources start to run out, it might close a currently inactive app but it will restore it back to just how you left it. It's more like the system puts the app into hibernation instead of closing it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLUR-red phonebook with social skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A smartphone?s phonebook can store a serious amount of information about your contacts. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing the contact list, you can swipe right to reveal the History ? a list of all recent communications with all contacts. Alternatively, a left swipe displays all recent status updates from all contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This swipe magic is available when viewing individual contacts too ? in this case only history and status updates for that contact are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this to work, you have to link the contact with their Facebook, Twitter, MOTOBLUR address book or Gmail accounts. This gets done in a second ? tap the menu key, Link contact and pick the appropriate account (those are pulled automatically from the services you?re logged on to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook shows MOTOBLUR at its best ? blurring the distinction between ?local? and ?online? and putting all the info from all the sources at your fingertips.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony omits smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY had no issues with reception and the in-call sound was loud and clear. The phone has the proprietary CrystalTalk technology: a dual-mic set-up for filtering background noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it doesn?t have is ? unfortunately but hardly surprising ? Smart dialing. You do get voice commands (including dialing), which aren?t as good though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DEFY offers a few advanced features too ? a double tap will silence a ringing alarm, while turning the DEFY facedown will only leave the vibration on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola DEFY. The DEFY scored ?Average?, meaning you could miss some calls in noisier environments. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swype messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All text-based communicaton on the Motorola DEFY is handled in the Messaging app. It combines a unified inbox, standard text messaging, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department is standard Android stuff ? threaded messaging is enabled and the message composer has a neat and simple interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom and messages are displayed as speech bubbles, just like on the iPhone. Unlike the dialer, the recipient field in the compose message UI has ?smart search? ? start entering the name of the contact and suggestions will show up immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tap-to-compose box starts off with a single line but it will expand to three lines if needed. It won?t expand any more than this. It would have covered the received messages if it did anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DEFY lets you preset the number of messages recorded in each thread. Once that number is exceeded the oldest message gets deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. You can enable push email or schedule automatic updates. There?s an option to sync only over Wi-Fi, which is sure to save you data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Universal inbox looks and feels exactly the same as the Gmail app. It combines all your email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll cover the Facebook and Twitter sections of the Messaging app when we discuss the social networking features of the Motorola DEFY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is enhanced by Swype. It?s the new way to enter text that relies on you sweeping over the desired keys rather than tapping them one by one. This noticeably improves the typing speed thanks to the Swype algorithm which makes very accurate guesses.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MOTOBLUR spreads on the gallery too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY comes with a custom Gallery app (like the XT720 one) with cool 3D effects, reflections and smooth animations. In terms of eye candy, we have no complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery is split into three sections ? Camera roll (shows the most recent photos you?ve snapped), My tags (you tag photos to keep things organized), Folders (combines all folders from the memory that contain photos or videos), All Photos, All Videos and Copy Protected stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a folder (be it the camera roll or another), photos are displayed as one long line of photos (landscape mode) or as a grid of small thumbs (portrait mode). In the 3D landscape view you can scroll sideways to browse the photos and as you do, a label appears that shows when the photo (or video) was taken. From the menu option, you can set a specific point in time and the Gallery will scroll there automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smooth animations sure are eye-catching but a boring grid view is much better for browsing a large collection of photos. Turn the phone on its side and it will switch to grid view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can tag photos (including the automatic location tag), which will make viewing specific photos so much easier, even if you don?t take the time to meticulously organize everything into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zooming is also enabled here but you can use double tap too. The Quick upload and Share features offer quick sharing via MOTOBLUR Share (on Facebook, MySpace, Picasa, Photobucket, etc.) and also Email apps, Bluetooth and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can resize, crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. You can also add effects, adjust contrast, saturation and also text, clip art and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quickest way to fix up a photo however is the Kodak Perfect Touch. It automatically fixes the photo ? you don?t have to do anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing still missing in the DEFY Gallery that we would have liked is support for, say, TwitPic or another easy way to send out a tweet with a link to a photo, without having to first upload the photo, manually copy its URL and then write your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Android Market has many apps that do just that, but still.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mixing social and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player on the Motorola DEFY takes the same approach as the Messaging app ? it puts all the music related things in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Music is the basic music player ? it plays songs from your memory card and it can filter tracks by artist, album, playlists and so on. A cool feature automatically pulls album art for the song and ? get this ? the song lyrics, which are displayed in sync with the song. This turns the DEFY into a mini karaoke (of course, it needs an Internet connection). But there is more ? some non-English songs even have English subtitles under the original ones ? an awesome feature!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the screen reveals the scrubber. You can send a blip ? a quick ?Love it? or ?Hate it? message on Twitter or Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another cool option too ? you can see who is listening to your current track and where they are around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Videos section of the Music app offers quick searches on YouTube or GoTV for the music videos (what else?). Community taps into the social networks to find you some new music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view TuneWiki charts, Music Maps (sort of location-aware ?currently playing? feature) and HOT Playlists, which show the most popular songs on Facebook or Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a song ID feature of course ? tap the button and in seconds you?ll know the name of the song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing though. The equalizer presets are uncomfortably stored deep in the phone?s setting menu, there?s no Cover Flow-like Album Art view, and you can?t set a favorite track from your playlist to repeat several times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality doesn't disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY did greatly in the first part of our audio quality test. When the handset is connected to an active external amplifier (such as a car or home stereo) it achieved excellent scores and showed no weaknesses whatsoever. And the device is pretty loud too. In this scenario the DEFY can easily rival the best among mobile phones (and even dedicated players).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play however there's noticeable degradation, mostly in terms of stereo crosstalk. Frequency response worsens a bit too, but it's still not too big a deal. The final components of the DEFY performance to lose some ground here are the inter-modulation distortion (which increases to average) and loudness (which drops from excellent to just good).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we would say that the DEFY did a very solid job, but audiophiles might still have a few better options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limited codec support in the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player itself is as simple and basic as it could possibly be. You can pick a video from the Gallery (with the cool 3D wall and everything) and tap play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support is limited ? DivX wouldn?t work, just XviD. And then only up to WQVGA resolution (400x240). Higher-res videos seem to need more processing power than the DEFY can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the MP4 playback is concerned, Motorola DEFY managed to handle all files we threw at it up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio only on the headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 10 stations as favorites. There?s no option to play the radio on the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with local radio stations, you can listen to Internet radio too. There are plenty of stations to choose from and in many genres. But you?d better have a solid data plan or a Wi-Fi connection as Internet radio will run up data charges.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY packs a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum resolution of 2592&#x445;1944 pixels. There is a LED flash too, but don?t expect miracles in low-light scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is perfectly simple ? a resolution indicator, a counter with the remaining shots and a virtual shutter. A tap on the screen reveals the Gallery shortcut (with a preview of the last shot taken), Scenes, Effects and Flash keys plus a camcorder switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom tags are a handy feature to keep photos organized ? you can add a tag, say ?holiday 2010? and it will remain active between sessions until you delete it (at the end of the holiday). Adding and removing tags is fast and easy. There?s an automatic location tag too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the actual photos produced by the camera, they could have been better. The biggest problem is a prominent tendency to underexpose images. On the other hand, color rendering is flawed ? pictures are dull, with notable bluish-green tint. On a positive note, noise levels are tolerable and the amount of resolved detail is decent. The overall quality is average at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few samples to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Motorola DEFY to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video still does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video capture is limited to VGA resolution (640x480) at 30 frames per second. Far from impressive on paper, but in reality videos turn quite nice and are a joy to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the VGA@30fps video sample from the Motorola DEFY.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY has great connectivity features ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE fast dual-band 3G with 7.2Mbps downlink speeds and 2Mbps HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity features include Wi-Fi b/g/n (with DLNA support), Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and a microUSB port. You can connect the DEFY to a computer in several modes ? memory card access, charge only (useful, the ?memory card access? mode locks up the card, so you can?t use many apps), Windows media sync and ?Portal and tools?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a microSD card of course, and if you need to do bulk data transfers then using this will be faster than over USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone portal app however was the most impressive part of the connectivity package. It practically lets you browse the phone?s contents on your desktop browser. You can connect over USB or via Wi-Fi ? once you start it, the DEFY will give you an IP address to type in the computer?s browser and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even password-protect the connection. From then on, you can browse photos and files (the file browser works only with Internet Explorer though), adjust settings and also manage contacts ? including composing and sending messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The idea is great ? you don?t always need the full functionality of a PC Suite (the Phone portal can do quite a bit) and you can?t always have the PC Suite installed on the computer you?re using.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser does the Flash magic even without Froyo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve established time and again that Android has a good browser. On the Motorola DEFY it?s even better because there?s Flash included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is completely minimalist (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and a bookmarks shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DEFY supports two zoom methods in the browser: double tap and the multi-touch pinch zooming. Text reflow isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key six new virtual buttons pop up. You can open a new tab, bookmarks, switch tabs, refresh the page, and go forward. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark view shows a thumbnail list of the bookmarked pages and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excellent multi-page support is of course still available and the rendering algorithm is basically flawless. Panning and zooming are pleasingly fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the BLUR-red Flipout, DEFY also supports Flash on its Eclair. YouTube worked fine (if a bit slow), but the other video sharing site we tried didn?t do so well. We tried a Flash game though it never made it past the ?Loading...? stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least it let us use sites that have Flash-based navigation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A social phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The custom MOTOBLUR UI on the Motorola DEFY does a great job of integrating social networking with the rest of the phone features. We?ve already seen the social phonebook, the gallery with easy upload to social networking sites, and the SNS enabled music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?re lots of social widgets on the homescreen and a couple of dedicated apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is Social Networking ? the app behind the eponymous widget. It can display status updates from all your social networks (or just the ones you pick) and it can be used to set your status on some or all social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t offer much in the way of browsing profiles ? you can add comments, post on the Wall and like a profile, but to view the full profile you?ll need to use the browser. Not much of a problem, the browser is good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between Social Networking and the Social Status widget is that while SN is primarily for reading status updates, the Social Status is for posting. It also displays the last status update you?ve posted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app has support for both Facebook and Twitter. Its main job is sending messages between contacts more than posting general status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks deceptively similar to the SMS messaging UI. It displays conversations in threaded view, with speech bubbles when viewing a single thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is great because it makes sending texts no different than sending a tweet or a Facebook message. On most other phones, the two things are separate concepts with separate UIs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status? live folder is also here ? it?s small and space efficient, but when you tap it, it expands to fill the screen with the latest status updates from your preferred social networks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its Android siblings, the Motorola DEFY comes with a rich set of organizer features and a document viewer to boot. Not that getting one off the Android market is impossible but it?s nice of Moto to have saved you the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is their app of choice and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). For editing, you will need to upgrade to the paid version though and there?s no support for PDF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, which makes viewing attachments easy. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them to the phone memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. It is also integrated with the status bar and also offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DEFY features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the YouTube app is easier to use than the YouTube site, considering the small low-res display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and navigation with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY comes with a GPS receiver which locked onto satellites in about a minute with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the titular application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in any of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could of course hit the Android Market ? it will offer both free and paid alternatives, which can do more than just voice guided navigation. Some apps can record GPS data, training apps keep track of your lap times and so on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Android Market is open for business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market is split into two major sections ? Apps and Games. Both sections are divided into subcategories (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. You can tap Top Free or Just in if you?re just browsing for something new that might be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep an eye on the Downloads section ? when an update is released for some of your apps, there?s an ?Update available? label next to the app. Tap it, hit update and your app is up to date, it?s that simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button and type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the essential ones are well covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.). It?s not (yet) as rich as the iPhone?s App Store, but it?s getting there. Mostly, it?s the games department that?s a bit thin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve always known Androids to be friendly creatures. And the Motorola DEFY gives us no reason to think otherwise. The whole rugged thing is purely for self defense ? protection from the elements. And the best thing is it?s tough but doesn?t look it. Compact and friendly, young and social, this is a smartphone that?s likely to enjoy strong demand. It looks more and more a smart move from Motorola not to put too much emphasis on ruggedness. After all, why would they want to place themselves in a niche, when they can go for the whole midrange instead?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DEFY is the right phone for the young ? it?s not charging a fortune and is good enough at most of what it does. It?s got good media and a complete connectivity set ? the Motorola DEFY will even throw in a couple of surprise perks like a capable music player and the Phone Portal app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a good phone for the price ? but obviously not without its flaws. The first thing to consider is the OS release. Though there?s still a good number of droids running Eclair, updates are being rolled out as we speak. Motorola are not committing to any specific timing and that?s doing the DEFY no favor. With Froyo, the phone would?ve been really hard to resist. Next on the list of dislikes, the still camera could?ve been better and video capture is nothing to write home about either. Smart dialing would?ve been welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, these are not the ultimate deal breakers ? not in this price range and demographics. The Motorola DEFY is probably picking up where the HTC Tattoo left off. And if you ask us, it does look like a direct competitor of the Nokia C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Tattoo ? Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another rival is the Froyo-running HTC Desire. Typically, it would?ve been too big a bite for the midrange Motorola DEFY but the Desire is going down the ranks ? the Desire HD has taken over. All in all, it?s bad news for the DEFY, which has to compete with a former flagship, which has already been updated to Froyo too. HTC are in no mood to give the DEFY a break. The Wildfire, the Aria and Gratia will be trying to steal some market off Motorola too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire ? HTC Wildfire ? HTC Aria ? HTC Gratia</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outside the droid world, the recently unveiled Samsung S8530 Wave II should start selling any moment now at about 350 euro. It is based on Samsung?s Bada platform and, like its predecessor, the Samsung S8500 Wave, features a 5MP autofocus camera with 720p videos enabled. This time around, you get a 3.7? Super Clear LCD display instead of a 3.3? Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8530 Wave II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressure from the Windows Phone 7 side of the field will be coming from the likes of the HTC 7 Trophy. The good news for Motorola is that the DEFY costs considerably less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC 7 Trophy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can go on comparing the Motorola DEFY to a slew of smartphones. But ones with rugged credentials are hard ? if not impossible ? to come by. And still, this here tough Droid is more than just your average durable phone. Good looking, young and social is what Motorola wanted it to be. Surviving a party that has got out of hand is just a bonus.</paragraph>
