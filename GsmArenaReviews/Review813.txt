			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the Northern hemisphere enters the summer season, it's the second year in a row that Samsung releases a rugged version of its incumbent flagship. This time around, it is a toughened take on an already IP certified device, so they went through the roof with military-grade protection against all kinds of extremities. At least for the time being, AT&amp;T can call the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active requires a lot less compromises than its predecessor. As capable as it was, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active lacked the highly-praised Super AMOLED unit of its civilian sibling. It also packed a lower resolution camera (8MP as opposed to 13MP), thus denying its users two of Samsung's staples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast, the newcomer features the exact same specs as the already well-known Samsung Galaxy S5. The only things missing are the microUSB 3.0 port and the fingerprint sensor. It has made way for more rugged navigation keys. And they're hardware buttons again, like on the previous generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a quick glance, the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is everything we expect it to be - a toughened up version of the SM-G900. The gorgeous 5.1" Super AMOLED display is on board and so is the 16MP camera capable of 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beefed up dust and shock resistance surely is a welcome sight too. The same goes for the shortcut button on the device which can be utilized as a camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, the S5 Active suffers from mostly the same niggles as its regular sibling. They include poor video codec support out of the box, lack of OIS in the camera, and the presence of a single mono speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pundits will also point at the lack of fingerprint sensor, though we reckon that its absence is offset by the presence of more comfortable and sturdier, navigation buttons - ones you can press even with safety or work gloves on. The limited availability of the device is surely an issue too, though we are certain that a globally available version is quite likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to kick the review off with unboxing, followed by our take on the design and build. Head over to the next page to find out what the S5 Active is like in the flesh.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active ships in a white/orange box with AT&amp;T branding. Inside you will find the smartphone, stereo headphones, USB cable, charger, as well as a couple of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the handset has you covered in terms of extra accessories. This is hardly a surprise considering its stature in both Samsung's and AT&amp;T's product lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality, handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active follows the same path as its predecessor. The handset looks like a tougher version of the corresponding flagship - despite the extra armor it is undeniably a member of the Samsung Galaxy S family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make its ruggedness even more prominent, the smartphone is available in eye-popping color schemes. They include Ruby Red, Titanium Gray, and Camo Green like our test unit. We found the latter to be a great conversation starter, though, we reckon, it will certainly not appeal to everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One downside of the newcomer's design that we found is the overwhelming mix of different textures throughout its body. While we do understand the necessity of extra protection, we reckon that some uniformity would have been welcome by many.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is exceptional. The smartphone is literally built like a tank (it kinda looks like it belongs in one too in Camo Green). Thanks to its construction, IP67 and MIL-STD-810G ratings, the handset is part of the small club of devices which can be used comfortably without a protective case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical measures of the S5 Active are 145.3 x 73.4 x 8.9mm, at a weight of 170.1 grams. Unsurprisingly, the Active is thicker and heavier than the regular S5 (8.1mm and 145 grams). However, considering the added layers of protection, we believe the extra bulk is well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is a pleasant experience. The handset is one of the grippiest we've encountered in a long time. Every surface save for the display has a pleasant texture to it, so accidental drops are extremely unlikely. But even if you do let it slip off your grasp, there'll be no damage done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has one major handling advantage over its regular sibling. Its hardware back and recent apps buttons cannot be pressed accidentally like the capacitive ones of the SM-G900.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active features the same 5.1" FullHD Super AMOLED display as the regular version. Its pixel density is 432ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinema mode offers true to life colors that were thought impossible on AMOLED. The Galaxy S5 Active's display really makes the "LCD offers more natural colors" argument useless. And, as usual, Samsung offers more saturated screen modes if you prefer your images punchy rather than accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's true that unlike most of its competitors, the display still employs a PenTile matrix, rather than a conventional RGB, but the diamond arrangement makes sure that results in no visible artifacts and, with pixel densities north of 400ppi, you can't take away points for sharpness either. You can only spot differences if you compare two panels side by side and look from so close that your eyes hurt, which is hardly ever going to be the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active are slightly lower than on the regular Galaxy S5, though on par with the previous generation Galaxy S4. However, due to their low reflectivity, this doesn't affect outdoor performance. Keep in mind that enabling the auto tone setting in the screen option limits the maximum brightness to under 300 nits, so if that matters to you, you better keep it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility, quite expectedly, is top-notch and the Galaxy S5 Active is a s a solid performer outdoors. The sunlight contrast ration is very close to the traditional Galaxy S5 display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as a bunch of sensors. The traditional ambient light and proximity sensors are joined by an IR gesture sensor, which enables the Air gestures in applications such as the web browser and music player. There's also a 2.1 megapixel front-facing camera for video calls and a status LED up there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, you will find the trio of resistive navigation buttons. They are separated by tiny strips of chromed plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is home to the volume rocker and the shortcut button. The latter is quite useful and we will take a closer look at its functionality later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key is on the right side. There is nothing else there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S5 Active features the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the IR blaster that lets the smartphone remotely control various home appliances. There's also a remote control app with a pretty rich database preinstalled, so the functionality is available right out of box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port and the mouthpiece are located on the bottom of the handset. The former is expectedly covered by a flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset is home to the 16MP camera lens with LED flash, the heart-rate monitor, as well as the single loudspeaker. A Samsung and an AT&amp;T logo keep them company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heart-rate monitor is located right next to the LED flash at the back. To use it you should hold the phone as you normally would with one of the fingers resting over the sensor and keep it steady for a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSIM slot, the 2,800mAh removable battery and the hot-swappable microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is worth noting that the battery cover is harder to remove than the one of the regular Samsung Galaxy S5, which is nothing out of the usual given the extra ruggedness of the Active version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are some live pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active European model.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering that it has the same 2,800 mAh battery as the regular Samsung Galaxy S5, it is hardly a surprise that the Active showcased a similar battery performance. The handset achieved an endurance rating of 70 in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above means that you your handset will easily make it through almost three full days if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback. The replaceable battery on the other hand, should keep power users calm, as they can pick up a spare one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our routine also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active features extensive connectivity options headed by LTE with speeds of up to 150Mbps / 50Mbps. Where a 4G network isn't available, the phone can do 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity also includes Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support, with 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature borrowed from the iPhone (which later dropped it) is called Download booster - files over 30MB are downloaded over LTE and Wi-Fi simultaneously. This also works for native apps that have been set to use Wi-Fi only, but not for third party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 + LE is also available (it's used on all new smartwatches and other wearables), plus there's ANT+ for additional sports gadgets. NFC is available for quick pairing, with Android Beam and S Beam handling file transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS and GLONASS receivers are available for accurate location data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well, on top of the 16GB of built-in storage (11.2GB are actually available to the user). The cable connection takes place via microUSB 2.0, not 3.0 like in the regular Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active also supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that. TV out is available too, if you have an HDMI adapter and the phone can output surround sound. Wireless screen mirroring is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An IR blaster allows the phone to control a TV using Samsung's Smart Remote app. We will take a closer look at it later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have certain Samsung or HP printers, you can wirelessly send photos, documents and other things (e.g. web pages, contact information) to be printed too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat customized by the most recent incarnation of TouchWiz for smartphones. Samsung has added multiple features that increase productivity and enhance security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has no widgets aside from a few special controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen features the My Magazine that displays both news articles and social networking updates. This is powered by Flipboard and you can enjoy your reads in a clean interface and send links to your friends or post social updates straight from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Categories (e.g. News, Business, Facebook) are displayed as tiles, each displaying its top article. You can reorder and hide the tiles. Once inside an article, you can browse more articles in that category with the familiar Flipboard effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are regular homescreens too, with shortcuts, widgets and folders. If you want just those, My Magazine can be disabled completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is similar to what we've seen on Galaxy Pro tablets with its flat design and circular icons. The toggles work as usual and below them are two buttons (S Finder and Quick connect) and below that is the brightness slider, which can be hidden to save space, but you're stuck with the two buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a new feature called Recommended apps, which adds relevant shortcuts when an accessory is plugged, like the headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the app drawer, icons are presented as a customizable or alphabetized grid and you can also view only the ones you've downloaded yourself. You can also disable some of the pre-installed apps so they won't take any RAM or appear in the app drawer. You can also hide icons to keep the drawer from getting cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 Active has an App Switcher button that calls up a custom switcher UI. As usual, you can go into the task manager for more advanced controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 comes with the Multi-window multitasking feature, which allows you to run two apps side by side. You can copy text between apps or snap a screenshot of one app and paste it in the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a pair of apps works well together (e.g. the browser and the email client) you can create a shortcut that launches both. Note that only select apps work with Multi-window but more can be found in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no floating apps here, but there's something called Toolbox - a floating icon that shows a list of shortcuts once tapped. This is a quick way to get to some of the most commonly used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the shortcut button above the volume rocker reveals the Activity Zone menu which contains several outdoor-specific features. They include compass, barometer, flashlight with different modes, as well as (oddly) a stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long press of the shortcut button can be programmed to open an app of your choice. It can also act as dedicated camera button - a long-awaited and welcome addition to the device's set of features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset (MSM8974AC). Some clarification is due since not all 801 chipsets are created equal. The MSM8974 is the base Snapdragon 800 chipset, while MSM8974AB overclocks the GPU and gets the Snapdragon 801 badge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSM8974AC goes a step further and clocks the CPU higher too. Also worth pointing out, on the KitKat software, Samsung has removed the benchmark detection and overclocking, so if the Galaxy S5 doesn't trounce the Galaxy Note 3 it's because it's showing real performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 are benchmarks which put to the test the hardware combo inside the smartphone. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance, etc. Unsurprisingly, the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active performed on par with its regular sibling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single-core, multi-core, and math performance, among others. We focus on the overall and CPU scores. Once again, the newcomer showcased similar performance as the SM-G900.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan. In 1080p offscreen mode the GPU is tasked with performing graphical computations in 1920 x 1080px resolution. The Galaxy S5 Active did a stellar job in both T-Rex tests, though its results were slightly lower than those of the regular version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2.1 looks at HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active posted a flagship-worthy result on both occasions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active performed in accordance with the high expectations towards it. The smartphone is one of the most powerful Android devices available today and has the benchmark scores to show for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dialer with Blocking mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active has strong reception and in-call quality was clear and loud (even too loud perhaps at high volumes). The dialer is the familiar TouchWiz app and features all the basics - smart dial, quick dial and even a video call button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is part of a tabbed app that also houses the Logs. Those are very detailed and show not only calls, but messages too and you can filter by various types of events (missed call, received message, etc.). There's even a search feature if you need to look up calls from just one number or contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 Active features auto call rejection - it can reject all calls, only calls from specific numbers, all unknown numbers and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blocking mode is even more restrictive - it blocks incoming calls and silences notifications and alarms. Only contacts on the priority list will be able to get a call or a message through. Blocking mode can be set to turn on and off automatically during a certain time period (e.g. at night).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were worried that the extra protection will have detrimental effects to the loudspeaker. But instead, the Galaxy S5 Active speaker offers louder sound compared to the original Galaxy S5 - quite an impressive achievement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The list of contacts is displayed alphabetically and there's an alphabet scroll and a search field. Your contacts automatically get synced with your Google account and your social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed by either first or last name, depending on preference. They can be filtered based on where they come from - SIM, phone, specific online accounts or any combination of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options: edit contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print contact cards, get friends via social services, etc. You can edit contacts and assign custom ring and message tones and even custom vibrations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app has a row of shortcuts for the contacts you message most often and below that is the list of all conversation threads. Threads feels like a standard IM app and you can customize font size, the shape of the bubbles and the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app handles both SMS and MMS and features a wide variety of smilies. Note that using smilies greatly reduces the number of symbols in a message - it drops to 70 and each smiley counts for two symbols (that's because they use the Unicode format rather than the GSM alphabet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages app has some cool features too - you can delay dispatch by 3 seconds (or up to 30), so you can cancel a message before it goes out. You can also schedule messages to be sent automatically (say, congratulations for a birthday).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also features spam protection - messages from specific numbers or containing specific phrases can be blocked. Safe mode will disable the feature that automatically makes links clickable and will scan them for potential threats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set an Emergency message to go out to primary contacts when you hit the Power button three times fast. The phone can optionally take a photo (without making a sound) and send it along with the message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 Active comes with two familiar email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic app to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic app handles multiple accounts from any email server and features a combined inbox. It has a spam filter and Delayed send options similar to those in the text message app. It has a Primary Senders inbox just like Gmail too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of chat applications are preloaded on the Galaxy S5. Google's Hangouts does IM complete with group chat and sending photos, but it can handle video chat too. Google has turned it into its default SMS/MMS app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung QWERTY keyboard features a row of numbers above the letters and a rich set of features. You can enter text by swipe-typing (like Swype and others), as well as move the cursor or view all alternative symbols for a key (which can be great if you use special symbols a lot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The button row has a quick dial-like feature where you press and hold a number to enter a preset phrase. This can be used for standard messages like "okay", "can't talk now" and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small floating keyboard is also available, which comes in handy with Multi Window as you can move it out of the way (and it takes up less space to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two input methods are Voice input and the Clipboard view.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active can be viewed by time or by album and filtered by several categories. Event is the basic view, which groups photos based on time and location, but it's the other modes that caught our interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom will change the size of the thumbnails and can also open and close individual photos. Batch operations are supported and that includes not just copy/delete but also image rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single photo view has several shortcuts for sharing (via an app or over DLNA). The Quick Connect button in the notification area will scan for all ways you can share something in the Gallery with nearby devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit images right in the Gallery itself. The new Studio option is quite powerful and can do anything from basic editing and photo collages to creating and trimming videos. It also handles the post-processing of Shot &amp; more photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S5 Active is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by several categories and you can hide some categories you don't need. Folder view is available and so is scanning for DLNA servers (Quick Connect helps with this).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the Music square - the phone scans your music library rating each track in terms of tempo (Exciting or Calm) and emotion (Passionate or Joyful). It can then load a playlist matching your chosen tempo and mood. The emotion axis in the graph can be switched to Age, which makes it easy to automatically create a playlist of classics or contemporary hits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: timescroll, playback controls, an AllShare shortcut. A coverflow-like list of album art lets you know what the next song will be and is an easy way to skip right to it. The music player will also try to find the lyrics for the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled several audio-enhancement features. The SoundAlive equalizer presets are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance between Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle or enable a Tube amp effect, 7.1 channel virtualization, along with Studio, Club and Concert Hall effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of audio features doesn't end there. Smart volume will keep the sound level consistent across tracks, while Adapt sound tests the performance of your headphones and tunes the equalizer based on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active handles files from the local storage and DLNA-compatible devices. Chapter preview lets you jump to a specific scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support is not great, however. Many videos we tried resulted in an "audio codec not supported" message and even some basic video codecs don't work (i.e. DivX). MKV, AVI (XviD) and MP4 videos do play, but anything beyond MP3 or AAC sound is a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If subtitles are available, the video player will automatically find and load them. You can also manually load subtitles if the video and subtitle file names don't match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the zoom mode (100%, fit to screen width and without affecting the videos aspect ratio) and there's a pinch zoom too, in case you want to get close to a specific part of the action. Instead of zooming in, you can zoom out and turn the video into a floating window with the familiar Pop Up Play feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology from the music player is available here too. There are additional settings for the brightness, playback speed and playing the audio over Bluetooth (if you have wireless speakers).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going all rugged hasn't had a great effect on the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active audio output. The smartphone produced excellently clean output, which was mostly in-line with its non-MIL-SPEC sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When used with an active external amplifier, the Galaxy S5 Active produced excellent scores top to bottom and garnished them with nice loudness levels - well above the average and even higher than those of the original Samsung Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes a rather large spike in stereo crosstalk - larger than that of the vanilla flagship, but the Galaxy S5 Active still remains an excellent performer everywhere else. And its volume levels are still higher than most of its competitors (barring the One (M8)), so we'd commend the smartphone for an excellent overall performance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>16MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active features a 16MP camera, Samsung is mum on the exact specs but judging on the produced photos, we'd say it's the same large ISOCELL sensor as the one inside the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a 16:9 sensor so widescreen photos use the full sensor. We are again guessing there's a Phase Detection auto focus sensor inside the Galaxy S5 Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is the same as in the S5. There's a column of shortcuts on the left, the middle two of which are customizable. All settings are collected into a grid of shortcuts so you can access everything easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button has been simplified too, it's now just a scrollable list at the bottom. Several options have been combined into Shot &amp; more - Best photo, Best face, Drama shot, Eraser and Panning shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Virtual tour shot mode is similar to panoramas except you can move forward, turn left or right, move some more. The result is an animation of your camera movement, the phone will even draw a map with your path. More modes can be downloaded too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selective focus is another cool mode. It takes two shots and processes them so you can photograph a close-up subject and blur the background or blur the object and keep the background in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note on Virtual tour and Selective focus shots - they produce a single JPG file that's easy to share. When viewed, it appears as a single photo, but you'll need a compatible Galaxy device to view the additional functions (refocus or play the virtual tour). As a result file sizes are pretty big too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish Samsung enabled an option to export virtual tours to videos so they'll be much easier to share.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active camera is an excellent all-rounder. Photos taken in daylight have a commendable level of detail and, while processing comes on a bit strong, it shouldn't be visible unless you're viewing photos at 100%.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality is amazing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active can record 2160p videos at 30fps (in this mode some features are disabled), 1080p at 30fps and 60fps. There's also a 120fps slow-motion mode at 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files with bitrate varying by mode. 1080p @ 30fps videos are still captured 17Mpbs, 60fps mode goes up to 28Mbps, while 2160p videos are at a whopping 48Mbps. That means a short 30 second video grows to 180MB - be mindful of that if you're recording a video you want to share later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, sound is recorded in stereo at a bitrate of 128Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera doesn't have as many fancy shooting modes as the still camera, but dual shot is available and you can do time lapse videos. The time lapse videos can speed things up to 8x, with resolution and frame rate remaining at 1080p @ 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. There's also digital zoom available up to 4x and the quality is pretty good even at the highest level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos shot with the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active offer stunning detail, especially if you shoot them at 2160p. Noise levels are low, color accuracy is good and there are few traces of aggressive post processing (unlike with the still camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the 1080p video mode too - obviously you don't get as much detail, but the much smaller file size and better compatibility (many computers can't play 2160p properly, especially when it's in a Flash container) make us think this mode will be used the most.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is 2160p-enabled cameraphone. The resolution chart (third one) shows an image quality that will give 8MP still cameras a run for their money. Image quality in good light is great, though compression artifacts start to creep in the shadows. In low light, most of the fine detail is gone, we'd go with 1080p in the dark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active comes with both the stock Android browser (customized by Samsung) and Google's Chrome. Both support Multi-window, but only the stock browser supports Air View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the interfaces of both browsers are virtually identical. Both show favorite web sites on their new tab page and can sync bookmarks and open tabs across devices. The browsers handle multiple tabs (with Incognito mode), but in Chrome you can switch between tabs by horizontal swipes from the side, which is pretty handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is available if you don't feel like typing up a query.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view, Smart scroll and Smart stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your finger over a web element and it will act like mouse-hover, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that Chrome has an option to reduce traffic by compressing web pages on Google's servers before they are sent to the device, similar to how Opera's Turbo mode (and Opera Mini) work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active has a number of features that enhance the security of your data. There are basics like encrypting the phone and the external memory card in addition to the more selective Private mode option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Find my mobile out of the box. It has remote controls so you can reset and lock the device if you lose it and check its location on a map. Once reset, you can prevent the phone from being reactivated. The phone can send out a message the moment a new SIM card is inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a backup function that keeps your phone logs, messages, wallpaper and several other settings backed up in the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health has gotten even more advanced. The step counter is always working in the background, keeping track of how many calories you've burned. For more accurate measurements, the Galaxy S5 also features a heart rate monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You just press the tip of your finger against the sensor (below the camera, next to the flash) and in a few seconds you see the reading. For continuous readings, you can pair the phone with a Gear smartwatch or a dedicated sensor made by Samsung, Timex or Garmin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the basic pedometer, S Health can also track running, cycling and hiking. Goals can be set based on distance, time or calories. During an exercise the app can play music and report your progress out load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having burned up some calories, you can tell the app what you've had to eat in great detail. The app has extensive lists of various foods and their energy value. Calories - both eaten and burned - can be tracked on graphs by hour, day and month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share your workouts with friends (including photos) if you're the competitive type. You don't have to take the Galaxy S5 on a run with you either, a Gear device can take the readings, which will be synced with S Health.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While S Health is quite advanced, third party apps can integrate with it and provide even more comprehensive exercise tracking though there are none as of yet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While it wasn't preinstalled, the Polaris Office 5 is available as a free download from Samsung Apps. Just go to the Galaxy Essentials category (there you'll find other useful apps too). Anyway, Polaris has a clean interface and does both viewing and editing of Office documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android calendar has been replaced by S Planner (as usual). It features six different views: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, list and tasks. For the month view, events on the selected day are listed in a panel on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Multiple online calendars are supported and they can be color-coded for easier recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator, voice recorder and a memo app are available out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is quite advanced too. Each alarm has its own tone, snooze and repeat settings. It also features Smart alarm, which rings quietly, slowly turning the volume up for a less stressful wakeup. The app also features a world clock, stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S5 Active key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FullHD Super AMOLED display is one of the best in the business and a joy to look at</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is everything we expected it to be and more. In terms of functionality and feature set, the handset is almost every bit as capable as the SM-G900 with the added benefit of higher durability and improved grip. The aforementioned two could very well make the model the pick in the Galaxy S5 range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional strengths of the Samsung Galaxy S family are all here. The handset totes beefy hardware, a gorgeous Super AMOLED display, the TouchWiz UI with all its goodies, and one of the best cameras available on a mobile device. The option of designating a camera button via the shortcut key makes the setup even more attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The added layer of ruggedness is really useful and executed without adding too much bulk to the device's waistline. Like we already mentioned, it makes the handset one of the few high-end devices out there which can be carried around without a protective case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Progressively-thinking potential users will certainly point at the lack of fingerprint scanner and microUSB 3.0 on the device as notable omissions. However, during our time with the handset, we didn't miss either of the two features - we actually liked the improved design of the phones navigation buttons. The fingerprint scanner on the other hand, is likely to become fully utilized as technology in the next major Galaxy S release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Limited availability is undeniably a setback which the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active has to endure. We doubt that the AT&amp;T exclusivity will last long though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of availability, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is priced at $199.99 on AT&amp;T with a two-year contract. The off-contract price of the handset is $659.99. As always, here are some of the alternatives to the device worth considering in the same budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular Samsung Galaxy S5 of course is for those who don't need the extra ruggedness on top of the dust and water resistance. The SM-G900 offers the same functionality in a slimmer body, as well as fingerprint sensor. However, it won't handle drops and wear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is almost painfully good looking and a joy to hold. It brings top notch stereo speakers and superb audio quality to the table, though it is one drop away from losing its charm. It doesn't like water either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 is also a mighty good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active. It is beautiful to look at, has stereo speakers, and a massive battery. Its glass-covered body however, is nowhere near as rugged as that of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active. The price of the Xperia Z2 currently hovers around $600 for an unlocked grey import in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is bound to hit the shelves in the US in the immediate future. It packs a killer 5.5" QHD display, good camera, and a feature-rich UI, though it is nowhere near as rugged as even the regular Samsung Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is the best equipped rugged smartphone out there. If you are in the United States and looking for a smartphone of this type, the handset must be at the very top of your shopping list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Potential users in the rest of the world should look forward to the wide release of the handset as well. But only if they can provide the life of adrenaline and adventure this phone is built for.</paragraph>
