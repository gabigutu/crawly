			<paragraph>Yes, it's true, Motorola have made slider phone with the RAZR looks. Its name is RIZR. The letter-game name still holds true. This is the first Motorola slider for the European and American markets. The Asians are a different story. Considering its big dimensions and the fact that it is a bit overweight one might think that Motorola RIZR slider won't be the most handy and comfortable phone to touch and use. One might be wrong then, the RIZR is extremely nice to touch as it is metal and rubber all around and leaves the greatest impression. Its weight adds to the feeling that the phone is solid as a rock and more than reliable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z3 RIZR model can be easily compared to the new Ultra series of the Korean Samsung manufacturer. But when we look at the technical and software capabilities of the Samsungs, RIZR just fades away. It's not even as slim as them.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>    Motorola RIZR Z3 ? Slid out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RIZR Z3 comes first in this class segment in the Motorola shelves as they have never introduced sliding phones on the European and American markets. The phone features the popular RAZR V3 design with its metallic looks and recognizable keypad. The user interface is somewhat untouched and cannot be hard to get by any previous Moto user.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The design of Motorola RIZR is typical for their models which come with a lettered name. On the front panel we can see the Motorola M sign just above the 256K TFT display. The thick thumb-rest for assistance of the sliding process is just beneath the display and the only thing that completes the front panel is the set of buttons in the very bottom. There is a four-way key with a confirming center which is well known from the first RAZR V3 model. Surrounding it are two soft keys, a Browser button, a C back button and the green and red "receivers", which in the case of Motorola are round symbols.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The size of this phone is slightly bigger than one might've thought but when held in hand, RIZR Z3 leaves more than nice feelings. It is equally balanced and feels firm and solid in ones hand. Although, Motorola is promoting it as an extra slim phone, this model is 16 mm thick, which makes it a normal phone judging by nowadays trend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    RIZR held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of Motorola RIZR is rather bare. It features the camera lens in its protective glass case, the Motorola M sign in the middle of the battery cover and the blue speaker grill in its bottom. Beneath the battery cover you may find the BC50 Li-Ion 720 mAh battery which, according to the manufacturer should last up to 350 hours of standby time and up to 6 hours and 40 minutes of talk time. We couldn't test the battery of the phone as during our testing, the phone is under heavy overload and the real endurance of the battery remains unknown.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When you remove the battery you will find one strange thing. The SIM card bed is located on a plate with the microSD card slot just above it. As far as the memory card is concerned, there is no problem, but the SIM card is really hard to insert and even harder to extract. It must be slid in a very narrow hole and then it is almost impossible to get it out with your bare hands. You will most definitely need some sharp item to push it out. We consider that a very outrageous design and a construction fault.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The left side of the phone has 3 buttons to offer: the dual-volume keys and the Voice recorder activating button under them. Besides these buttons, there is an incrusted Motorola sign there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Left hand side ? Dual volume button and Voice recorder button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side has more to offer as it hosts the camera release button and the Voice command button on top of the mini USB slot. The mini USB slot is used for charging and data connections. This is where you plug anything in the phone. The same incrusted Motorola sign is here too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When the phone is slid out, nothing more is revealed, well, the keypad of course, but the back is empty and the only thing you notice is the great construction and mechanisms as it slides out perfectly and without any effort and slides back in with a confirming snap sound which deserves compliments for the nice elaboration. No creak sounds and noises were performed by the phone during the whole testing period. One strange thing, we consider to be a defect fault of our testing sample, was that the left direction of the four-way button gives out a creaky sound.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A RAZR keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of RIZR is very much the same as in previous models of Motorola, and the first model with such keypad design is the famous RAZR V3. It is very nicely elaborated and one can have perfect control. The numeric part of the keypad is visible only when the slider is fully slid as it is on the bottom panel. The control part of it is on the upper, top panel and thus can be operated without the phone even being slid out. The two soft keys on top can be configured according to the user's will. Regrettably in every Motorola model, the Browser key is not configurable. A new thing here is the C back button which is similar to the Sony-Ericsson models, which have such back button. Here it serves as a correction button too. The backlighting of the keypad is in deep blue and is evenly illuminated.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>256K perfectly visible colors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola's engineers truly deserve compliments here as their new display remains perfectly visible in direct sunlight and can be readable in almost any situation. This is admirable as most modern phone suffer this drawback. The backlighting of the display is great too. Now as for the visualization features of the display, it is capable of 176 x 220 pixels resolution with 256K colors which seems quite enough for the functions this mobile is packed with.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As we used the RIZR as a work phone, we could test the quality of sound and calls and it did great. There were no noises and the signal reception was flawless.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The saga continues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The graphic user interface implemented in Z3 RIZR model sure looks a lot like RAZR V3's interface and the previous KRZR and SLVR L7 models. Motorola have not made many changes so we won't spend too much time on this section. We are only going to accent on the differences. One such is the ability to switch between categories with the "?" and "#" keys in the Calls log. This option was only available in other menus but not for the Calls log in previous models. Now, you can switch between Received, Dialed and Missed calls with the help of the hash and asterisk keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Stand-by look of Motorola RIZR Z3 with different styles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other minor changes in the interface are the different themes and animations in the menu. Our team is fully confident that the new themes preinstalled in Motorola Z3 RIZR are much better than those in previous Moto models. The menu is fast enough for the most wanting users. Motorola have really done their job well with this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The main menu in different themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola RIZR Z3 has an option to ask you whether you want it to be switched on in Airplane mode right away or use its GSM phone features. This comes quite handy and it is a must-have in the nowadays phone models.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1000 standard entries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Motorola RIZR is a standard Motorola one and it can fit up to 1000 entries. Every contact can be assigned multiple phone numbers, email addresses, home and work addresses, a ringtone and a picture to show when he or she's calling you. The search method used in this model is the one in their latest phones, meaning - writing the first letters of the desired contact. In the RAZR model this operation was performed by selecting the first letter only and there was no option in the first software versions to search with more than one letters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The log - use * and #<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already said, the main addition in Motorola RIZR is the ability to use the hash and asterisk keys to browse through sub-categories. These categories all contain up to 10 latest calls, doesn't matter if we speak of dialed, missed or received calls. The log can show you the time and date when this event has taken place but cannot show you the amount of times you've for example dialed the same person.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging, just as in every Moto phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging menu is the same as in all recent Motorola models, meaning there are different Message Inbox and Email Msgs inboxes. There are also the Drafts, Outbox, Voicemail and Sent Msgs. When you create a message, the editor asks you, as always, if you'd like to create a Message, Voice Msg or Email. A new thing is the character counter as it counts from zero on, not backwards. It tells you how many messages will be sent when you get to the point of confirming the person you're sending the message to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message Centre ? Message type ? writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email client works with attachments. POP3 and IMAP protocols are supported too. There are options to preset the intervals you email inbox will check for new messages. There is also the feature to download the headers of new emails only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Email settings</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A music phone? No.<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola RIZR Z3 has a relatively loud loudspeaker. It can be heard in noisy environment. This is great but the quality of the sound is not so good and that's why we don't recommend it as a music phone. You can plug in your favorite headphones if you find a audio jack-to-USB connector. The software music player in the phone is quite nice, actually. It supports shuffle, replay, playlists and a long list of music formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music player ? List of music files ? Player menu ? Playlist options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When minimized, the music player can be controlled by the ways of the four-way button. Regrettably, there is no option of running more applications simultaneously. For example, you cannot run a game and play a tune in the same time. Also, you cannot do anything and start the camera application as the latter will shut automatically down any other running application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video playback</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera - almost there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone's camera is very simple and easy to use and anybody who has owned or owns a Motorola camera phone would have no troubles getting used to work with this camera application. It has the basic customization features like brightness, color schemes, image rotation, blur, inserting frame, contrast, etc. You can also adjust in what format you want the phone to take the picture. Of course, we advise you to set to it on the 2 megapixel setting as it gives out best results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Taking pictures with Motorola RIZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Viewing a taken picture ? File too large message ? Different effects ? Free space information</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Adjusting image settings ? Browsing the images folder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to picture quality, it seems that Motorola almost got it right this time. The pictures are smooth, there is no excessive noise even in low light. The resolution is good for a 2 megapixel camera. The only department where RIZR is lacking is the colors. They are quite dull. What is strange, the color balance is different throughout the frame at least on the testing unit (final version, not beta). At the left side of the frame you can see a slight green tint, on the right side - slight red tint, for example take a look of the stripes of the Mini or the photo of the elephant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>EDGE is here, but no 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The RIZR model offers the customers GPRS and EDGE connectivity as well as USB and Bluetooth for short-range connections. Regrettably, Motorola have not implemented any 3G module in this phone. Every single feature works seamlessly and USB connection with a PC is perfect when you have the appropriate drivers and software installed on you computer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsers and synchronization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The built-in browser is capable of opening basic web pages but cannot handle java scripts and more serious pages. We recommend installing the Opera mini browser which works seamlessly. Synchronization on Motorola RIZR phone can be done in several ways. First of all, there is the MOTOSYNC application which automatically does it through a server if your network supports it. There is also the computer-phone synchronization which can be done with the use of the Phone Tools. You can also try and synchronize you contacts and calendar entries manually by sending them to another phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calendar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola's organizing tools are the Calendar, Notes, Calculator and Alarm Clock. The Calendar has month, week and day views. You can add an event with a reminder to keep your schedule on track. The Notes application is inside the Messaging menu and you can write a text note if you have something short to remember. The Calculator is a simple one. The Alarm clock has options to create a repeated alarm or just a single time alarm. Other than that, the applications work as they're supposed to. The Voice Recorder application uses the free memory which means it is practically unlimited.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are some preinstalled applications in the phone. One of them is the MotoReader. This application is used for opening Office documents such as Word .doc and Excel .xls files. It is a fine addition to the phone but since it is a Java application it lacks speed of work.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The BlockBreaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only preinstalled game in our testing sample of Motorola RIZR Z3 was the BlockBreaker game which was quite amusing. It is rather easy to control and the game play is intriguing enough for a mobile phone game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Block Breaker Deluxe Game</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice design, same interface, some drawbacks.<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone surely has great of look and feel. Its rubber and metal construction is so solid it makes you proud of it. But the lack of 3G, the strange SIM card solution and some other minor drawbacks makes the score even. So, we think that if RIZR is offered on a reasonable price, it might just become a market hit. If the price satisfies you and the offered pack suites your needs, don't hesitate and give Motorola RIZR Z3 a try.</paragraph>
