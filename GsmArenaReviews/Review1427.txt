			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Berries have been changing ? in small steps, and big leaps. Sometimes stumbling, other times graceful and assertive. It seems the time was finally right for the Pearls? makeover too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s been almost three years since the last of the Pearls. But if you wanna know what kept RIM busy all that time you?ll have to look up the Storm and the Torch. Touchscreen or the highway wasn?t a choice RIM wanted to make but had to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, Pearl is not nearly exciting as the Storm, the Bold or the Torch. Bringing the budget lineup up to date is not the best job RIM have had to offer lately. But whoever got assigned to it did well. Better perhaps than they thought they would. Three years is a long time. Long enough for people to start thinking you?ve given up. Long enough for RIM to know they couldn?t afford to mess this launch up. And luckily, the BlackBerry Pearl 3G is right on the money, reviving a famous messenger family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 is the upgrader?s dream come true. A bigger and better display: check. Upgraded camera: check. Premium connectivity: check. Faster processor: check. Slim and sexy: check. We wish it were that simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s say it again ? it?s the budget lineup. Not the A team. Simple, compact candybars with little to no fancy features and certainly no fancy finish. That?s what used to make a BlackBerry Pearl. But? well? the berries have been changing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of late, RIM are trying to shake off their uptight image and the Pearl lineup is obviously part of that transformation too. In the Storm series and the Torch, touchscreen makes a lot more difference of course. The Pearl lineup has its own way of breaking the rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, BlackBerry Pearl phones come with a hybrid QWERTY keyboard. New Pearl is not afraid to offer a new set of users a choice. It comes in two flavors: a trademark half-QWERTY keyboard on the Pearl 3G 9100 and a regular numpad on the 3G 9105. These are otherwise two identical handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pearl 3G overwhelmingly upgrades the original Pearl series. That?s one thing the users will appreciate most. But BlackBerry is looking to reach out to new customers too and the two different keypads do seem to make sense. It?s almost as simple as a hybrid SureType keyboard for the BlackBerry faithful and a regular numpad for the newcomers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s hard to please all really and we don?t know yet if the Pearl 3G 9105 will justify all the expectation. It just seems though it can?t be another easily forgotten sequel. For anyone coming from any of the older Pearls it?s an out-and-out upgrade ? and an eagerly awaited one too. But isn?t it just a bit too bold, too disrespectful of tradition?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re looking at the first BlackBerry phone EVER to come with a regular numpad. Even the Pearl Flip 8220 didn?t dare to be different all the way. So ultimately, the question is who the Pearl 3G 9105 is for. We don?t pretend to have all the answers but we?re eager to look for them in the following review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contents of the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 retail package are not too surprising. You get a microUSB data cable, a charger (with two different power plugs) and a one-piece headset. There's also a 2GB microSD memory card, a mini CD with software and the usual bunch of paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that?s missing in the Pearl 3G retail package is a carrying case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 stands at 108 x 50 x 13.3 mm and weighs 93.6 grams. The Pearl lineup is the compact class. It?s a BlackBerry package for the size-conscious and the budget-minded. We usually praise RIM for the styling of their handsets but it feels special recognition is due here. Never before have Pearl phones felt so sexy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been a while since the last BlackBerry Pearl and what we have here is the perfect upgrade in terms of not only features but styling and feel too. It?s not like the Pearl 3G 9105 has extra special expensive finish. Quite the contrary in fact ? but the phone looks and feels quite fit and fresh ? simple but not without class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The piano black gloss up front is a questionable choice but despite the inevitable fingerprint issues, the handset manages to impress. You might expect the phone to feel cheap, but you would be wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pearl 3G features another thing that runs in the BlackBerry family ? the dark silver frame and stealthy top buttons. The hidden keys are handling music controls this time, instead of Lock and Mute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has faux metal finish which is subtle enough ? and quite practical. The sides have a soft rubbery feel ? similar to the Curve 8520 ? with few discrete controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 256K-color screen runs 2.25" in diagonal and has the rare 360x400 pixel resolution. It looks like the perfect solution for the Pearl?s size and price. More importantly, it easily beats the display resolution of what seems to be the main competition ? Nokia?s Eseries candybars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No QWERTY keyboard, no BlackBerry. Who would think they?d cross that line. The BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 is to be remembered ? even if it?s for being the phone that said No to QWERTY keyboards. It must?ve made sense though and seemed risk-free. Why not ? as long as Blackberry purists are getting a proper phone in the shape of the Pearl 3G 9100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you can?t expect someone good at making QWERTY keyboards to screw up a nice and easy numpad. Bottom line, the alphanumeric keypad on the Pearl 3G 9105 is great. It?s peculiar a wave pattern where entire rows are sculpted for excellent touch orientation. Keys are well spaced out and clicky enough. It?s a fine keypad for quick typing and there are some rare perks too: Backspace and Enter keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard BlackBerry navigation pad is the dividing line between the display and the keypad. A small but finely responsive optical trackpad is the centerpiece, the menu and back keys and the two call buttons on its sides. The End key doubles as a power button. All the controls are perfectly usable ? with good stroke and tactility. The trackpad is great and we guess it?ll be some time before the Berry trackballs, which we?re so fond of, are back in fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the display we find the earpiece and a status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Pearl 3G 9105 incorporates the 3.5mm audio jack, one of the "convenience keys" and the microUSB port. There is no cover over either of the two apertures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the left convenience key activates voice commands but you can easily assign it a different task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same holds true for the other convenience key, which is located next to the volume rocker on the right-hand side of the 9105. It?s set to act as a camera key and is a two-step button ? auto-focus and capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing of interest at the bottom, the mouthpiece being the only notable presence there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the 9105 Pearl 3G is where it gets interesting - here you can find the hidden dedicated music keys. It seems RIM learned from their experience with the Curve 8520. This time, the music controls are a lot more comfortable to use. They are not separate buttons but a platform that can be pressed on the either side or in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music keys have a fairly short stroke but getting a press accepted is easy enough, unlike on the Curve 8520. The middle play/pause key also serves Mute and Lock/Unlock in the relevant context (short press / long press). The star key on the keypad will lock the keypad too, but only the top button can do the Unlock trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 features nothing but the 3 megapixel camera lens and its LED flash companion. The lens is unprotected ? not even recessed at all ? so it seems quite easy to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the rear cover reveals the microSD card slot and the 1150 mAh Li-Ion battery. The microSD card is hot-swappable; never mind its location under the cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pearl 3G 9105 lasted the impressive five days on a single charge, though we must admit we weren?t too hard on it (about ten minutes of telephony and 40 minutes of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 is neat, compact and handy. The new Pearl phones get a boost to performance and new, looks to match the new skill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an all plastic phone but feels quite sturdy and handles comfortably. Fingerprints are a pest and you?ll need to take the time to regularly clean your handset to allow it to look its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there?s little to worry about on the outside. You get a sexy little push email machine, with a good high-res screen and a comfortable keypad. And you know, you can make it a hybrid QW-ER-TY keyboard. That would be the Pearl 3G 9100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now join us on the next page to check out the software package of the Pearl 3G.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 5: not quite the ultimate looker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 9105 runs on the proprietary BlackBerry OS v5, which somewhat reminds us of a Hummer H1. It?s not the kind of vehicle you want to be seen in as it?s disastrously ugly but it will take you everywhere you need to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as with previous versions of the BlackBerry OS, the functionality is mostly there but the design is not easy on the eye. Come to think of it, even the BlackBerry OS 6 didn?t deliver all the multimedia glamour that RIM promised so it would be foolish to expect such a thing from such an out-and-out BlackBerry device as the Pearl 3G 9105.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s familiarity that counts here and we can guarantee that all current BlackBerry users will feel at home with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other side of the coin is that there are still tons of downright ugly text-only submenus plastered all over the Pearl 3G UI. Even with the slickest theme selected you are still just a couple of clicks away from these eyesores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously this is another device suitable for hardcore businessmen who can live without eye-candy (as this one really offers none of it). Users were obviously supposed to focus more on the hardware updates than the software as otherwise they would be really put off by the RIM attitude. We are not saying every OS should become webOS when it grows up but the DOS era is long gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video of the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pearl 3G has the same menu structure as all other BlackBerries released over the past few years barring the Torch. It?s not exactly newbie paradise as the ideology behind it is rather different from everything else on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has 5 shortcut buttons placed at the bottom and all the status icons are at the top. The profiles and the connectivity settings can be accessed straight from here, as well as two other features that you choose to assign to the convenience keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you can pick the today layout, which gets rid of the shortcuts and give you messages, phone and calendar events on screen. Pressing one of them takes you to the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu navigation on the Pearl relies on a single menu key for revealing all the contextual options and it?s an unusual experience for first-timers. Most other brands use soft-key based navigation with labels keeping all options in sight. There is no caption with BlackBerry here so you should check out what the menu key does in every situation. Come to think of it, Android follows pretty much the same logic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are free to rearrange icons, place them in folders or even hide them as you see fit. Just as we said at the beginning of the chapter ? the functionality is all there. However even Symbian is a great looker compared to the BlackBerry OS. Not to mention that the most popular smartphone platform worldwide also offers way more customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s exactly this unwillingness to accept change that makes BlackBerry devices suited for a niche market only. They are more of a complement to the service that the company offers than worthwhile handsets themselves. It goes like that ? if you need the service you will have to pick one of the equally handicapped devices available .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back on the positive track the BlackBerry Pearl 3G performs rather decently with little lag and good responsiveness. The OS is obviously well optimized or the 624 MHz processor inside is really efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we?re kinda optimistic about the update to Blackberry OS 6 that was promised by the manufacturer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: not for the weak of heart<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 3G phonebook looks as something that came out of a bygone era of Windows Mobile PocketPCs and smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that once you shake off the initial shock you realize that it does the job it?s meant to. You get virtually unlimited capacity and good organization plus the feature set to suffice for the needs of 99 percent of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company in one of those black and white lists that we warned you about. You can search a contact by gradually typing the desired name like on almost any other phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put your contacts in categories (personal and business by default but you can create others) and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you a vast number of fields which are organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields (those that you are going to need to anyway) as many times as you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dial benefits telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 did OK in its main duty ? making calls. We didn?t experience any problems with reception or in-call sound quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that might be expected and doesn?t bring any bonus points, Smart dial is certainly a great asset. So good in fact that there?s hardly much point in using the phonebook for dialing numbers again. And it works when inserting contacts in messaging too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do is punch a few keys on the homescreen and the names that have the typed letters will appear on the screen instantly. You can then select them with the trackpad and initiate a call ? it doesn?t get any simpler than that, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another worthy call feature is Voice dialing, which gets activated by pressing the left convenience key by default. The blank screen will bring back memories of Windows 3.11 but hey, it?s called vintage looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 9105 did reasonably well in our traditional loudspeaker test too, producing a Good score. Still it might be a good idea to keep it within sight in noisy environments, unless you want to end up missing a call or two.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are used to seeing solid if unspectacular performances by BlackBerry devices in this area and the Pearl 9105 lived up to our expectations. The handset handles the usual SMS, MMS and email and also offers has the BlackBerry Messenger IM client so you can stay in touch with your Berry buddies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All messages arrive in a common inbox but you can distribute them to different folders afterwards. Searching for a specific message or recipient is also available and so is flagging messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing all kinds of messages is done through a common editor. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. You can quickly add a smiley or any kind of attachment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The emailing is also offering quite a lot of customizable options and a functional, if ugly interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you out-of-the-box you can only set up BlackBerry Internet Service email accounts on the Pearl 3G. This means that without a proper Blackberry service plan, the handset is just a plain no-email device since you need to have that before you go setting up any other email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s definitely a drawback in our books as there are quite a lot of carriers globally that do not support BIS yet. But then again, it just comes to confirm that you would hardly be looking into buying a Blackberry device if you don?t intend to use the Blackberry services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery of the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 is the typical BlackBerry stuff we have described so many times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers the user a choice between thumbnail and list view of the images. You can also delete copy and move images or set them as caller IDs or wallpapers straight from here. Sending photos through Bluetooth, MMS or email is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos are browsed in portrait mode by default but you can rotate them if you prefer. The bad news is that you will have to do it manually as there is no accelerometer sensor to do it for you. And the interface remains in portrait mode at all times, which is less than perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery, by just sliding your finger across the trackpad. It is much more convenient than the outdated solution in previous versions of the BlackBerry OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is acceptably fast but not really impressive. Zooming in is pretty quick but panning is choppy at times and that?s putting it mildly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is another ugly duckling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are starting to lose count here really. Even worse we are starting to lose hope that we will ever meet a beautiful swan here. Okay, that might be a bit of over-dramatization as the music player at least offers album art. Oh and the feature set is decent, despite what you might have thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player sorts the music library automatically by artist, album and genre and you can search your tracks by gradual typing. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said album art is also here and there is single track repeat option. Equalizer settings, audio boosting and closed captions complete the tally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager, the main menu or any context menu. Unfortunately, there?s no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're used to seeing solid performances from BlackBerry handsets in our test and the Pearl 3G 9105 made no exception. It produced some excellent scores when no resistance was applied (as will be the case if you plug it in your car stereo, for instance) with the cut-off extreme bass frequencies its only notable flaw.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging a pair of headphones in the BlackBerry Pearl 3G increases its intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk but only slightly so the audio output still remains pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 frequency response</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has the brains, doesn?t need the looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We can say the exact same things about the video player of the Pearl 3G as for the rest of its multimedia package. However with videos on the screen there is less room for eye-sores so the interface doesn?t really bother you that much. And the wide variety of supported codecs make it all the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player usually works fullscreen with the virtual buttons only appearing upon a key press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the Pearl video player is that it comes with DivX and XviD support, incomplete though it might be. In fact it surprised us by playing 5 of the 6 sample videos we threw at it, which is one more than the Torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the performance wasn?t quite there on anything higher than VGA resolution at 30 frames per second but if you keep it under that you will be fine. All you will need is to upload the video to your Pearl 3G and start the player ? no converting necessary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel shooter not helped by the interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is equipped with a 3 megapixel autofocus camera and a LED flash. Just judging by numbers alone you can tell that it?s not the going to produce mind-blowing images but the fact is that there?s only one BlackBerry to feature a better snapper (no prizes for guessing which one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To call the camera interface basic will be a vast understatement. It only offers a very limited number of customizable settings, including white balance, color effects and digital image stabilization. There is also the obligatory picture size and quality and storage media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing those few options is pretty uncomfortable too. There are no shortcuts on the screen meaning that you have to dig in the menu. All you can do from the viewfinder is zoom in and out with the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which, we dare say, is more of an inconvenience than an extra as we often ended up zooming when trying to take a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key too isn?t ideally located on the side considering that you?ll do most of your shooting holding the phone vertically as the camera sensor orientation dictates it. The trackpad is quite suited for the purpose of a shutter key in this position but it takes the fun out of the auto focus as it lacks the ability to pre-focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing we can say of the otherwise really poor camera software support is that there is image-geotagging. This means that you can easily record your location in the images EXIF data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the image quality of the BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is quite good for the 3 megapixel league. The amount of resolved detail is nice and the luminance noise is not really bothering. Chroma noise is absent in daylight pictures or at least well concealed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is really ok. The only downside of the camera is the inconsistent white balance producing various color shades ranging from warm to cool regardless of the shooting situations. Hopefully that will be fixed in some future software update since it's really critical for the camera performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most BlackBerries, the BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is hardly a phone you will consider if photography is your thing, but it might just do the trick if you use it to take the occasional contacts photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording improves<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in the days when VGA was all the rage, BlackBerry handsets were recording QCIF videos. It took them a good few years to reach the VGA summit and the Pearl 3G is one of the first RIM devices there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is the world is now moving towards HD recording so VGA is not going to impress anyone. The high compression doesn't help things much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 3GP format and you can apply various color effects to them. The LED flash can also be set to work as a video light.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: all covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As most of its newly released siblings the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 gives you all the connectivity you might need and manages it pretty nicely too. Luckily the times of picking your connectivity priorities with those Berries are long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the 3G with HSDPA gives you the extra speed. The Wi-Fi is also present with a highly customizable (but again painfully ugly) Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the mobile phone including your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM. You can even use the handset as a tethered modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The trackpad really counts in browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is certainly one of the best we have seen among non-touch, non-QWERTY phones. Good software and precise trackpad navigation add up to a pretty good combo. Panning is great thanks to the trackpad and the virtual mouse cursor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is near perfect displaying almost every page like on a desktop computer. The high resolution display is another welcome bonus here as it allows more content to fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, pages are loaded to fit the display width with the virtual cursor taking the shape of a magnifier. You then just click on the part you would like to read and it gets zoomed in to fill the screen. A press on the back key and you are back to the fit-to-width view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the only bad part about the web browser of the BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is the lack of proper Flash support. Other than that, the handset provides probably as good an experience as you might have hoped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Living up to its business reputation the Pearl 3G 9105 offers a good set of time-management apps. Looks are again counting against it here, but usability is what matters most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows largely customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but sadly the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar entries can also be forwarded and conference call information can be merged into the Calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also fully functional, with preinstalled applications able to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. You can also get a free app for handling those PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Document editing is also supported right out of the box just as BlackBerry users are used to. However if you want to create a new document you will have to go for a paid upgrade, which is a bit puzzling. Well, we guess it won?t hurt copying a few empty doc files to your memory card instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the BlackBerry Pearl 3G 9105 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there?s the usual password keeper that allows you to keep you valued passwords safe in case your Pearl 3G falls into the wrong hands.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There are some games too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Pearl 9105 has the same games as its 8900 Curve sibling ? there are five titles, with the first two titles being a version of the all too popular Bricks game and Word Mole, where you have to compose words with the letters available on the board. We found Word Mole with its various bonuses and extra levels quite amusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the titles include Texas Hold?em King 2 which, as the name suggests, is a mobile version of the popular card game, Sudoku and a typing game where you shoot paratroopers by typing the letters over their heads.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is BIS-only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Pearl 9105 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. This means that voice-guided navigation is out of the question for the ones that buy it SIM free and then use it with their regular plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps provide basic map functionality plus voice-guided navigation. You can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application. Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on map the easily.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s try and outline the profile of the likely BlackBerry Pearl 3G user. To begin with, it?s either a guy or a girl. That one was easy ? business phones usually have unisex appeal. It has to be someone who absolutely needs the BlackBerry service for the corporate-grade security or whatever other reason. And they need to meet at least one of the following requirements: a) can?t afford the BlackBerry 9700 Bold or b) think the Bold and the Curve are too big and have too many buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this is no joke and we?re not in the mood to fool around anyway. The thing is, the Pearl 3G is made up of two different phones with completely different targets. If you answered yes to a and b above, and you?ve owned at least one BlackBerry phone, you?re most likely to go for the Pearl 3G 9100. That?s the one with the hybrid QWERTY keyboard - the proper BlackBerry, the one to make you feel at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pearl 3G 9105 on the other hand is perhaps for people who have so far snubbed BlackBerry for being too complicated, too corporate and uptight. Why wouldn?t they welcome something more mainstream, simpler and friendlier?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, really. Why wouldn?t they? The Pearl 3G 9105 is no worse than the Bold 9700. It?s the usual solid service in a cool mini form factor. So, how bad can it be if you take the QWERTY keyboard out of the BlackBerry equation?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Bold 9700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, it can be worse than the Nokia Eseries. The Pearl 3G 9105 has neither the design and build quality, nor the app catalog of a Nokia E52 or E55. It?s nearly twice as expensive with the higher-res screen the only thing to show for that. Even the Nokia E72 is cheaper than the latest Pearl 3G and it will gladly throw in a full QWERTY keyboard and a better camera to sweeten the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia E52 ? Nokia E55 ? Nokia E72</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But RIM seems to know what it?s up against. And with BlackBerry it?s always about the service and never about the device. The BlackBerry service will always be the key selling point for all BB phone but the Pearl 3G is trying to make a point that the Berry evolution is happening across the board, not just in the high-end.</paragraph>
