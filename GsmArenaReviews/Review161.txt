			<paragraph>Big round of applause, fade-out to happy ending: the MWC 2009 is now history. We were there and lived to tell the story. And well, there was a lot to tell. Now, we're not cutting the long story short here. We just sat down and went over the things that had us holding our geeky breath. And well, here's what it all boils down to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy to offer you our Magnificent Seven (no, none of us is that old) or otherwise the Top 7 of mobile phone features and novelties presented at the MWC 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not as simple as saying these are the seven best phones of this year's MWC. It's more like the things to remember and look out to, the innovation that moves the industry forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This article reflects our personal view as seasoned practitioners in the field. As you may guess, in a fast-paced industry like this one, the wow-factor is as important as it is hard to get right. We like to be wowed and here come the devices that did that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before we start, a word of warning is due. Those of you who have been following our MWC 2009 coverage are likely to already know the stuff we are going to focus on in this article.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Omnia HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First of, it's the Samsung Omnia HD. The Symbian-powered smartphone walks and talks multimedia and the 720p HD video recording is one of the most impressive features we saw at the MWC 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happened to miss it, we even took the baby out for a spin and snapped a handful of sample photos and videos with it. While the video is still jerky at times, the bitrate and the detail is impressive. We hope everything will be fixed by the time the Samsung Omnia HD heads for the stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two video samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 1  Video 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you've got to remember that the Omnia HD is not all about imaging and video. This monster of a handset comes with a 3.7" OLED capacitive touchscreen with 16 million colors and resolution of 640 x 360 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the connectivity side, the device is just as well equipped, offering Wi-Fi with DLNA, Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP, a standard microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack and TV-out. A GPS receiver with A-GPS is aboard, along with the optional Samsung Mobile Navigator by Route66.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD comes in two flavors: with 8 or 16GB of integrated memory, each with a hot-swappable microSD card slot providing up to 16GB of extra storage. The other notable features include DivX/XviD support, accelerometer for screen auto rotate, proximity sensor for auto screen turn-off and FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Arena user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have truly made a huge step forward with their latest S-class user interface to first be offered on the LG Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Arena has quite some tempting specs to start with, but it was the new user interface that impressed us. Running on a 3" display of WVGA resolution, the S-class UI is both intuitive and fast ticking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG S-class UI looks as attractive and user-friendly as the Apple iPhone Mac OS, but of course, it's not a smartphone platform. It's a feature phone UI with icon graphics that are currently in use on other LG handsets, but it has a totally new structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a short video demo so you see what we are talking about:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Idou 12 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There was no XPERIA X2 this year, but as the Sony Ericsson Head of Marketing Lennard Hoornik said, the next XPERIA is only a matter of time and finding the right product. For now, the Sony Ericsson Idou should be enough to keep us busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>XPERIA or not, the Idou created as much hype as the X1 and got catapulted to the top of the most popular phones in our database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only is it the first 12 megapixel GSM cameraphone, but it's also the first announced device to ever run on the brand new open source Symbian UI that's still being developed by the Symbian Foundation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5" qHD touchscreen, GPS and Wi-Fi and the relatively compact size are just an added bonus to an already impressive novelty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this live video demo of the Sony Ericsson Idou:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Sony Ericsson Idou is nowhere near complete - they haven't even come up with a proper model designation yet - Idou is still its code name. The demo units that the Sony Ericsson staff had at the event varied from graphically rich dummy phones to basic early prototypes. Some even argue that it wasn't a 12 megapixel camera sensor on the Idou units that were on display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the Sony Ericsson Idou is the first cameraphone to claim ownership of the 12 megapixel mark and even though we are not really into the megapixel race, we can't help but be impressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll have to wait and see though if the Sony Ericsson Idou will actually be the first 12 megapixel cameraphone to hit the market. Much like the XPERIA X1 last year, it may take Sony Ericsson at least half a year to get Idou rolling. Actually, we bet it won't be before October or November that we see an actual retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting thing about the Sony Ericsson Idou is the presence of a microSD card slot instead of the regular M2 one. Our first though was that it must be some OEM making the Idou for Sony Ericsson - just as it was for the XPERIA X1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we got word that it's actually the first sign of a major shift to microSD card slots at various levels in the SE portfolio. We are yet to see about that, but our hopes for a universal memory card solution are high.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N86 8MP camera specs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP was meant to be the biggest surprise of the show. After all the disappointment with Nokia still failing to pull off an 8 megapixel cameraphone, everyone was supposed to be overwhelmed by the announcement on the second day of the MWC 2009. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out quite that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and specs of the yet unofficial Nokia N86 8MP had leaked online by the first day of the MWC 2009 in a way not as impressive as Nokia may've hoped. And it was Nokia themselves that leaked the whole thing by unveiling the device at an alternative event elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another controversy about the Nokia N86 8MP was that some of the devices were branded N85 8MP. Plus, the camera image EXIF properties identified the units as N85 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, Nokia had initially planned it as an upgrade of the popular N85, which by the way is just how it looks. Then they changed their mind but strangely (and quite flagrantly) kept the 8MP label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the Nokia N85 has one of the most impressively equipped 8 megapixel cameras closing the gap between cameraphones and point-and-shoot cams. It's the first and only cameraphone to offer variable aperture values (F2.4/F3.2/F4.8) and a 28mm wide-angle lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the difference between the wide angle and a regular cameraphone lens. Here are two samples of one and the same scene taken simultaneously with a Nokia N86 8MP and another Nokia phone. The samples are downsized to 800x600 pixels as resolution is irrelevant. Just compare the field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other first-ever is the variable aperture. Having a variable aperture (like a regular digicam) instead of a fixed aperture (like a regular cameraphone) gives you one more way of controlling the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words, smaller F aperture numbers let more light in, while higher aperture numbers reduce the incoming light. You still get the same exposure, as the camera compensates for the various aperture settings by varying the shutter speed or the ISO, which are the two other factors that determine the total amount of light that gets in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But leaving the photography primer aside, the advertized aperture values of Nokia N86 8MP 

 (F2.4/F3.2/F4.8)
 have two distinctive benefits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first benefit is that at F2.4 the N86 camera has more light to work with as compared to the standard F2.8 value of all cameraphones we've seen so far. In low light conditions that allows you to get higher shutter speeds (possibly less handshake blur) or lower ISO (possibly less noise) or even both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second benefit from the variable aperture is that when there's enough light, the camera sensor can let the aperture close down a bit more (F3.2/F4.8) thus creating images that are usually sharper and with better depth of focus field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several full-res camera shots taken with the Nokia N86 8MP at the Nokia booth. If you check out the images EXIF data however you would see that the aperture value is F2.8, which doesn't really match what Nokia advertized. We guess the N86 unit we used was a too early one to really show its potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the imaging novelties, the Nokia N86 8MP is a really capable smartphone with rich equipment. Perhaps the only disappointment is the lack of a xenon flash and the screen size - we couldn't help a sigh over the Nokia N95 8GB 2.8" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP camera performance is yet to have a real trial by fire but the specs are no short of impressive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The latest HTC TouchFLO 3D user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This MWC we didn't see a truly novel and spectacular PocketPC signed by HTC. The company offered two sequels and what did impress us is the lengths the manufacturer goes to cover up the unwieldy Windows Mobile interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC presented their next update of the TouchFLO 3D UI along with their latest HTC Touch Diamond2 and Touch Pro2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is upgraded in both features and response. The difference is most notable when browsing images ? the onscreen image will virtually stick to your thumb and react fluidly and almost physically. The circular zoom gesture of the original TouchFLO is not available as the new devices now have a dedicated touch-operated zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new TouchFLO 3D of course is keeping the underlying WinMo interface pretty much under wraps. Its Home tab for example integrates the Call log, Alarms, Windows calendar and Weather the same way it did with the HTC Touch Pro. Opening a particular day in the calendar reveals not only the pending events but also the expected weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice asset is the tweaked Start menu, which instead of a drop-down list, now appears as a fullscreen scrollable list of large icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People tab has also been tweaked up. It features four shortcut icons under the contact photo - mobile, work, message and email. They allow you to contact the person directly from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact details are the other important upgrade here. Selecting a contact will reveal its details and the layout is more thumbable, with bigger tabs and fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another convenient addition is the tabs bar at the bottom, which contain threaded messaging history with an option for direct reply, as well as emails and call history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is also available in the new contacts interface so you wouldn't have to resort to the underlying WinMo for that. The most commonly used fields are notably larger and quite thumbable, while the rest of the info is still accessible via the original Windows Mobile interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing with the software upgrades we come to the slightly modified in-call screen as well as the redesigned software keyboard for better user friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, HTC are doing a great job with their UI plug-ins. And until Windows Mobile 7 is out, the Touch FLO 3D will probably be one of the best WinMo user interface plug-ins.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba TG01<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardwarewise the Toshiba TG01 is probably a true engineering feat. Not only is it the first mobile phone with a 1GHz Snapdragon CPU, but it's also the first to sport a massive 4.1? WVGA display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba have also managed to squeeze all that into a body that?s a mere 9.9mm thick and promise a standby battery life of up to 276 h.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the device seems way too large for comfortable single-handed operation and easy pocket stashing, it remains one of the most impressive pieces of technology that were on display at the MWC 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba also presented their first thumb-optimized WinMo UI called the Stripes interface, but it wasn?t nearly as impressive as the hardware aspects of the TG01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick demo of the interface so you can see what it is all about:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Toshiba TG01 seems outshined by some of the other ground-breaking devices presented this year, we are more than sure it deserves a special spot in mobile phone history.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Palm Pre new WebOS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, you've probably heard all about the Palm's new webOS and someone might have even told you it?s the next best thing since sliced bread. No, seriously, it may as well be that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm webOS was first presented back in January 2009 at CES 2009. Back then it made a big splash and had all of us on this side of the North Atlantic envious that it was only going to be available on the CDMA only Palm Pre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the MWC 2009 Palm debuted the GSM version of the Palm Pre and after a series of cross-examinations one of the Palm reps finally admitted that it should be out by the end of the year. So don't hold your breath just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Palm web is a wonderful OS that easily had the Apple iPhone on the alert when it was first announced two years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Palm had live demos of the OS running all day by specially trained staff that barely let anyone touch the Palm Pre units. The presentation of the Palm Pre and its webOS takes a good half hour but if you have the time we promise you it's worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the hip features of the Palm Pre is the optional Touchstone charging dock. Once you get yourself the dock and a new magnetic back cover for your Palm Pre (all sold separately) you can charge the device by simply placing it on top of the Touchstone. No plugs or wires needed! And if that ain't cool...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we saw Palm Pre finally appearing at the localized Palm websites for the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, we guess the announcement of the GSM version of Palm Pre is just around the corner.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i7410 projector phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia HD was not the only thing to catch the eye at the Samsung MWC booth. The first GSM-band Samsung projector phone called Samsung i7410 was also announced at the MWC 2009 and it pinned our attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7410 is able to project videos of HVGA resolution (480 x 320 pixels) on a 5 to 50 inches diagonal. While this isn't anything spectacular for a dedicated projector unit, it certainly is a feat for a mobile phone that isn't even Nokia E90-large.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD900 Crystal see-through phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another interesting thing, this time at the LG booth, was unfortunately behind glass only. It's the LG GD900 Crystal - definitely one of the most curious handsets around, offering an unprecedented see-through keypad. The manufacturer is refusing to reveal most of its specs, which suggests it's still a very early prototype.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte SmartZone user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gigabyte also presented a really interesting WinMo thumbable user interface called SmartZone that deserves mentioning on this page. It is fully based on Flash and covers the underlying OS pretty thoroughly. Even the Start menu has gone missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video showing what the new Gigabyte SmartZone interface looks like in reality:</paragraph>
