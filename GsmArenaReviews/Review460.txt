			<paragraph>The brilliant huge display is not the only characteristic the new Panasonic VS3 is going to attract customers' attention with. It also offers a remarkable design, a clamshell auto-open construction, a megapixel camera and a solid functional construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was not that long ago, when the color display on a mobile phone was considered unneeded and due to its poor imaging abilities people preferred to stick to the still more practical at that time monochrome display. Today the color display is a standard and its quality is being constantly improved. Modern displays are getting finer and more colorful every day. Today's mobiles are expected to be able to display the obligatory 65K colors. Provided they would like to stand out, they should manage then 262K. Now compare: the new VS3 clamshell from Panasonic is able to display the stunning 16 millions of colors. What's more, it does so on a huge surface with an extremely fine resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Six out of two<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year's new releases from Panasonic in the area of the mobile phones could seem quite dull at first sight. All clamshells that were presented at the 3GSM congress in Cannes in February this year feature similar design and the same constructional principal. Yet, the offer is pretty rich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central model is the perfectly equipped Panasonic VS7. It is a clamshell with an excellent big inner display, which is accompanied by a small outer display. The body of the phone is extremely thin. Its equipment, however, is rich including a megapixel camera. A little bit lower in the hierarchy is the VS3 model, which we are going to present in detail in this review. Unlike Panasonic's top model, VS3 has no outer display; it is equipped with an info diode, instead. The body of the phone remains unchanged as well as the inner display and the camera. Certain lighter differences could be expected in the functional menu. Unfortunately, we are not able to specify them here for we have not been given the exact characteristics of the VS7 model yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Panasonic VS7 a VS3</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two other phones - the tough SA6 and SA7 models - derive from the models mentioned above. Understandably, they feature different and more rugged covers with gum edges. In terms of functionality, however, they are identical to VS3 and respectively VS7. An interesting conception has been launched with the MX6 and MX7 models. They also stem from the two basic phone types, but are thicker by a millimeter. Moreover, they feature special accumulators of doubled capacity, which are expected to considerably prolong the stand-by time of the device after a single recharge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A flick!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Panasonic VS3 got over me almost immediately. This thin cuboid with sharp edges and utterly even covers may look a bit much too conservative, but in no case will you mistake it for some other mobile phone on the market. Its design could only be described as modern and descent, with certain provocative elements. The new Panasonic mobile simply brings a pleasant dose of diversity in the sea of round-edged clam shells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The phone is unique; you will not find a similar one on the market</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's size in numbers is 96 × 46 × 20 mm. The 2 cm thickness can be measured in the area of the camera lens only. The width between the front and the back cover's sides opposite to the lens is just about 18 mm, which makes the phone look really thin. Although one feels comfortable when holding the phone, when opened, it tends to overweight forwards due to the length of its body. The device weighs 99 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    It is a little bit bigger than the broadly accepted average size among the shell phones </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The skeleton of Panasonic VS3 is made of silver-like plastics, but its front cover is basically a colorful plate, which can be replaced to user's will. To do so, simply unscrew the screws mounted in the four corners of the cover. The phone we obtained for the testing process had a white front cover with small gray dots and the manufacturer's logo in its bottom part. Unfortunately, we were not given any additional covers, nor did we get the necessary tools to make the replacement possible. Yet, it is quite probable that the final delivery package will include several colored covers as well as a tiny screwdriver, for these were a part of the phone's complete accessory package, as it was presented at this year's CeBIT. There was where we ourselves had the chance to practice a cover replacement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Removing the cover ? the phone with a red cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another constructional finesse of the phone is its flick mechanism. By pressing the button placed on the left side of the joint the device gets opened in a flashy way within a split second. The high speed is provided by the energy that accumulates in the spring of the joint, and is therefore conditioned by closing the phone in the classic way. Of course, the manual opening is not a problem either. We have already come across an identical mechanism in the X400 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Button that opens the phone ? joint is solid, but gives out creaky sounds now and then </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the phone gets closed, the arrestment of its front cover is accompanied by a loud click sound. What should not be heard, however, is the unpleasant creaking. The rest of the plastic parts of the device - incl. the keypad - are very solid and thus do not suffer from any undesired sound effects. As a matter of fact, we still have not seen the final version of the phone, so we'd better wait until the real evaluations are published.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Recharging from the left<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The removable front cover is partly overlapped by an uplifted silver-like plastic platform, in which the camera lens, a tiny mirror for self-portraits and the info diode are imbedded. The info diode has been created to compensate the lack of an outer display and is able to light up in various colors. The light of the diode is relatively strong. The way it covers the entire surface of the front cover is impressive indeed. The spectacle is especially flashy at twilight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera lens is accompanied by a tiny mirror ? the info diode throws light on the front cover ? cover is fixed through the use of four screws </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mounted on the left side of the device is the opening button as well as the gum cover of the system connector. As a result, the bottom part is basically plain - there is nothing else to be found here but a tiny system diode, which alerts you that the battery is being recharged. The right side, on the other hand, is pretty full. Here you will find the camera shutter key, the infrared port as well as the volume buttons, mounted a bit lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Protected connector on one side of the phone ? buttons and the infrared port on the phone's other side </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is perfectly even. In its top part you will find two gum juts, which prevent the phone from slipping and save it this way plenty of visible scratches. Mounted in the upper left corner of the back cover is the eyelet for interlacing a strip. A little bit lower to the right is the grid of the loud speaker and the cover of the external antenna connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Gum legs and the eyelet for interlacing a strip ? the loud speaker grid ? a view under the back cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the phone's back side is basically its removable cover. Under it you will find a lithium-ion accumulator, which is said to guarantee the device an average durability of up to 240 hours in a stand-by mode or 300 minutes of calls. Our testing model went on working for two days without having been switched off during the night, which I consider a top-class performance, having in mind the fact that it was constantly being tested. If used in the usual way, I dare say the phone will probably perform twice as well. In this respect, testing the MX6 and MX7 models could be an even more interesting activity to catch on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A single, but then very good display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you open the phone you get its most precious treasury - the huge display of 34 × 45 mm of imaging surface. As expected, it is active, working in the very high resolution of 240 × 320 pixels. As a result, the spacing between the pixels is practically undistinguishable. As for the number of colors this display is able to show, we have already mentioned it once. In the computer world, this value is described as "True color". And it is really the true color and the preciseness of the display that make pictures viewed by Panasonic VS3 look just authentic. The only display that could probably be considered comparable to this one is the display of Sagem MY X-8 and Sony Ericsson S700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The big display </paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, I was having troubles trying to find something to rebuke the display with. Eventually I found out that all I had to do was to go out in daylight and try to work with the mobile. The cover glass of the display turned out to be its weak point. It is not antireflective and thus reflects practically everything. Setting the backlights intensity to a maximum was of no help, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pictures can hardly capture the extraordinary qualities of the display ? no matter how well the display can view pictures, in direct daylight it becomes almost unreadable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The missing outer display is substituted by an info diode, which can light up in six different colors. A special color can be assigned to each of the following: ringing, incoming message, closing the phone - as well as to other events. The calls addressed at or coming from certain contacts from the phone book could also be marked with a special color light. Contrary to some Samsung models, here the diode does not go out within a few seconds, but keeps on winking insistently until you open the phone. As a result, you do not risk missing any of your incoming calls or messages. Moreover, taking in account the speed with which the user can access the main display of Panasonic VS3, the absence of an outer display could be considered nearly irrelative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The light coming from the diode falls on the surface of the front cover in a real flashy way </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Comfortable keypad, weak backlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keypad is designed with the very and only purpose to make your work easier, so it features no special creative touches. The main control element is the round four-way navigating button made of transparent plastic material with a grayish ground layer. It is pressed with certain effort, because the margins of the surrounding plastics along its periphery are slightly uplifted. The central part of the navigating button is chromium-plated. It stands out and is thus easy to find by touch. Placed around it is the standard ensemble of the four functional buttons: the two context keys and the green and the red receivers placed below them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functions of the context buttons appear on the display. As for the ways of the navigating key, each of them can be assigned a function to the user's will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keypad is simple and very comfortable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric part of the keypad consists of a matrix of independent oval buttons. The material they are made of is also transparent plastics, but this time the ground layer is silver - just like the vicinage. The keys are relatively big. They are perfectly leveled to the surface that surrounds them, which makes pressing somewhat difficult, because the keys tail in a bit. The delicate click that comes out when a key is pressed confirms the made choice without disturbing those around you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keys are leveled to the surface that surrounds them </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, I quite like the keypad, not only because it is a peace of cake to write SMS on it. Yet, as you know, nobody is perfect. In respect of the Panasonic VS3's keypad, the imperfect element is its backlighting. The latter is somewhat greenish and does not suit the phone at all. Even though the backlight it is quite weak and uneven, all keys get lighted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Backlighting could have been better</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the colors play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper occupies the biggest part of the main display. For this purpose, you can find several nice photos prepared for you in the phone. In the top line of the display are placed the traditional state indicating icons. In the bottom line then are the symbols of the functions that have been assigned to the context buttons. Time is displayed in the top left corner. Below it is the date. The name of the mobile operator appears in three different locations in accordance with the various wallpapers, but it is not possible to switch it off completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of a standard nine-icon matrix. The icons themselves are gorgeously colored, incl. the elaboration of the shades. There is no animation. When selected, the icon changes a bit and its frame gets slightly accentuated through the help of the space effect. As the display is quite big, the legends of the icons have also managed to fit in. The legend of the selected icon are pretty big, the rest are really small. Anyway, for simple orientation, the icons alone are fully sufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tip: click on one of the displayed pictures for a larger view </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Stand-by display and main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the nested menus contain text only, there is a tiny icon at the beginning of each line. The display is able to view up to 8 lines. As a result, a completely full display while you are inside the main menu is a rather exceptional thing to see. Nevertheless, the font is big enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To move inside the menu you can optionally use numeric short-cuts. The phone's reactions are instant, without the slightest sign of delay. If the default blue environment does not match your taste, feel free to select one of the other two possibilities: the grey-green or the flashy black one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  There are three graphic themes to choose from</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nobody is perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Panasonic VS3 works in the GSM network at 900/1800/1900 MHz. Well, at least if you have a good signal. Most phones I have had the chance to test would usually display an average of 50 % net cover and thus would allow for relatively successful phone calls, no matter who I called. Panasonic VS3, however, did not do very good - the connection it managed to establish while in the middle of a phone call was often broken off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound that comes out from the ear-phones is clear, but still a little bit weak. I ran into a similar problem when I activated the loud handsfree - the sound it performed was also very clear, without any signs of resonance, but the maximum volume levels seemed somewhat insufficient to me. What you will not miss to hear for sure, though, is the ringing. Polyphonic melodies as well as real music pieces in various formats (incl. MP3) can all be used as ringing tones. The quality of the sound is generally good. It gets even better if the device is laid on a table. The reason is that the bass elements get more accentuated in the space below the phone and the sound feels like being distributed in a better way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like to mute the ringing tone, just press one of the volume buttons on one of the phone's sides. To deny a call, you need to open the phone and quickly press the key wit the red receiver symbol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Ringing can be modified according to profiles ? the standard sound menu is not very rich ? setup option for assigning a special color of the diode light to a ringing melody </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook takes in 500 contacts, each of them consist of 17 different fields. Here are some of them: 3 phone numbers, 3 email addresses, a birth date, an entire street address, a text note or a picture. For each contact you can even set a particular ringing melody as well as a specific message alert sound. Let me also remind you that Panasonic VS3 offers you the non-standard option to set your favorite color, with which the diode will alert you about an incoming call. The option for sorting all contacts from the phone book into groups is a matter of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phone book ? context menu of the phonebook ? contact detail ? picture is displayed when a call is coming in </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most frequently dialed numbers can be attached to individual keys of the numeric keypad. The others are accessed through the phonebook only. The latter is easy to search thanks to the big size of the display. Contact details get opened in six lines. In addition, visible in the top part of the display is a mini version of the picture attached to the contact. Unfortunately, any direct search in the phone book is based on the first character of the contact only. To enter a whole name or a part of a name you need to select the Search function in the context menu. A praiseworthy feature of the phonebook is the option to sort contacts by first name or last name as well as the function that allows for message creating directly from the context menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Texting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When I was writing SMS I could not help but praising the big size of he display once again. My satisfaction was caused by the fact that the display offers no less than 7 lines. At the same time the font of the letters is big enough and very comfortable to read. The countdown of the characters is displayed in the top line. To find out how many sub messages you have written you need to get into the context menu or wait until you start to send them. If you use the T9 dictionary to speed up the writing process, be prepared for three displayed lines only, because the rest of the space is reserved for the list with offered words viewed in a smaller font. To choose from those words, use the horizontal arrows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message menu ? writing messages with the help of the T9 dictionary ? info about the number of written messages </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor is so well-organized that even an inexperienced user will quickly find their way in it. There is a line for each of the four possible entries that can be gradually attached. In the last line you will find an option for creating a new page. This means that you do not see the message in the format, in which the addressee sees it. To see the final version of a MMS you need to access the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Creating MMS </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the phone lacks email client, you are free to additionally download one as a Java application. It is a pity, however, that the email addresses from the phone book remain unused.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The naughty infrared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another option you can amuse yourself with is the mobile internet. The phone is equipped with a browser, which manages not only WAP pages, but also simple web pages. Data transferring is ensured by GPRS Class 10. The phone is also able to work as a modem for a computer. The connection between the mobile and the computer gets possible either through a cable or through the infrared port. Well, at least provided everything that is supposed to work, really works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am writing this for we had difficulties with the infrared port in our testing phone. We tried to run it, but the operation was unsuccessful. The phone gave us an error alert. It seems, however, that it may be only the tester that suffers this problem for it belongs to the advertising series. For the moment we cannot positively say what the connection of the official phones will be like - whether they will be accompanied by service software and how this software could help. We could aver, thought, that synchronization is outcast. It is a pity since the phone could have won many customers among the more choosy users provided it did not lack this option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Data communication options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we did not have a data cable, we ran across a huge obstacle - there was no way how we could get the pictures out of the phone. Although the device lets you send pictures directly through the infrared port, in our case this was practically impossible for the infrared port did not work. At the same time, the phone does not have an email client and will not even allow you to insert a mega pixel photo into a multimedia message. For this reason I decided to let be the description of the camera for now. Let us first try to troubleshoot this inconvenience and then we will supplement the original review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in camera takes pictures in a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels. It offers three quality levels as well as a color effect. Available are also some extra functions like the one that compensates the exposition, sequent scanning, a self-release or a night mode. The sound of the lens shutter can be changed, but in no way is it possible to switch it off completely. The zoom is digital. It is active in lower resolutions only. Quite an unusual option of the camera is its macro mode. It gets activated by turning the ring around the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera's view finder ? camera settings ? viewfinder in a video shooting mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph> The macro option gets activated by turning the silver ring around the lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows to shoot video in the 3GP format in a resolution of 176 × 144 pixels. The maximum length of a video record is 1 minute. For pictures and other types of data the phone offers 30 MB memory. Pictures can be additionally minimized, decorated with frames or cut.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>If average quality cannot satisfy you ...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I got familiarized with Panasonic VS3 quite fast. The more I was getting used to its design, its brilliant display and its comfortable keypad, the more I felt sorry that the phone lacks certain higher-class functions. I could possibly get over the lack of an outer display, but I do not want to live without synchronization and Bluetooth. Searching in the phone book by first character and the worse signal selection appeared to be additional factors that took off some of my affection for this phone. Nevertheless, I am still attracted to Panasonic VS3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the sense of the above made remarks, I am quite optimistic about the new VS3. I am sure it will find its customers among the common, less pretentious users, who are looking - at the same time - for something more than just a "common" mobile phone. Let's hope, however, that this time Panasonic will get free from its bad habit to kill its mobile products with high prices already at their birth. Panasonic VS3 is expected to hit the market in the third quarter of this year at the price of about 240 euros.</paragraph>
