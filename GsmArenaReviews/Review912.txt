			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 was the star of the Nokia World show this year, but it certainly isn't the only new device to come out the Finnish company. It was joined on stage by five more piece of hot hardware including the company's first tablet, an affordable phablet and a trio of Asha featurephones. We had the opportunity to spend some quality time with those and we'll now be giving you a short overview on each one</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1320 is a stripped-down version of the Lumia 1520 phablet and sports a slightly of a different design compared to its more premium brother. It's reminiscent of Lumia 620 shape, but proportionally larger. The screen is the same size, but has been downgraded to a 720p resolution. There are other budget cuts, which we've outlined in the list below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>And here's Nokia's debut in the tablet market - the 10.1" Lumia 2520 tablet running on Windows 8.1 RT. Its design is reminiscent of the Lumia smartphones and its set of connectivity features is up there with the best on the market. Nokia has also invested hard work in its camera, which is cool. Here are the rest of the main features.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Those are what the two Lumias look like on paper, but now it's time to check how they behave in real life. We're going to start with the Lumia 1320 hands-on right after the break and the follow with the Lumia 2520 and the Asha trio on the next pages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1320 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's decided to go big this time around, with two 6-inchers and their first tablet headlining the latest Windows Phone offerings out of Abu Dhabi. Saying that the Lumia 1320 is the lesser of the new smartphone duo is a bit of a misnomer, as there's really nothing small about a handset of such size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a look at the specs sheet we see that this is decidedly the midrange member of the new smartphone duo, as it features a 720p display, a dual-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 400 processor, 8GB of internal memory with 1GB of RAM, and a much downgraded 5MP camera (compared to the 20MP PureView shooter on the 1520).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-core processor is a bit of a downer, as most respectable smartphone manufacturers nowadays opt for quad-core CPUs, even in their midrange offerings. Still we've already seen what the two Krait cores can do with the WP8 OS and the result is certainly not bad. It's not the stuff game developers are dreaming on, but your user experience won't be ruined by lag either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides we're expecting some great battery life as the 3,400 mAh juice pack from the 1520 has made its way here, and it won't have to deal with so many pixels on the 720p display. LTE and microSD support also partly compensate for the 5MP shooter and low internal memory, although not if you're a huge photography fan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the same display diagonal, the Lumia 1320 is slightly larger than its flagship counterpart in every dimension, including packing about 11 grams of extra weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, it retains the same durability as the Lumia 1520, and the matte finish with rounded corners make it pleasing to hold.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 2520 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 2520 is company's first tablet. It comes with a 10.1" IPS ClearBlack 1080p display and is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 800 chipset. Naturally, as the slate utilizes ARM cores, it is running on the ARM-compatible Windows RT 8.1 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 looks a lot like a stretched Lumia 800. It is made entirely of polycarbonate, its edges are rounded, and it even comes with similar silver glossy controls (Lock key and volume rocker) on the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Nokia Lumia 2520 is dominated by the 10.1-inch IPS ClearBlack 1080p display. It has excellent image quality - easily in the running for best tablet screen out there. A huge piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 2 protects the screen from scratches and cracks. There are two stereo speakers placed at the far bottom and barely visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a 2MP snapper above the screen for video chats and the mandatory capacitive Start key centered below the 10.1" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary microphone for active noise cancellation is at the back, very close to the 6.7MP rear ZEISS camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned above, the top of the Lumia 2520 houses the glossy Power/Lock key and the volume rocker. The microSIM and microSD card slots are also around, but you'll need the ejection tool to access both of them. The bottom of the Lumia 2520 has the proprietary connector for the keyboard dock and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Lumia 2520 has the 2.5mm charging port and the 3.5mm audio jack, while the left one packs the microUSB 3.0 and HDMI ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 is running on the latest Windows RT 8.1, and comes with Microsoft Office and free offline navigation thanks to HERE maps and services pre-installed. Those are two very helpful services and are bound to give it an edge over many of its rivals out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 2520 will be available in glossy red and white flavors, as well as in matte cyan and black models by the end of this year. An optional keyboard dock with an included battery, which will double as a screen cover will also become available alongside the slate at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got a presentation of the Lumia 2520 on video. The first one focuses on the hardware and software of the device ? the bright screen, slender Lumia design, plenty of standard connectors (including microUSB 3.0), plus exclusive Nokia software (Story teller, Nokia Camera, Video director).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second covers the keyboard dock, which is quite different than the one the Surface has ? the Nokia dock completely covers the device's front and back, but leaves ports accessible. It also adds two microUSB ports of its own and a battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 500, 502 and 503 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 500, the Asha 502 and the Asha 503 are the next step in the evolution of the Nokia featurephone lineup, aiming to help the company conquer an even larger user base in emerging markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finns have updated both the hardware and software of the new-generation Asha smartphones. All three devices will come with an additional "ice layer" on top of the characteristic bright colors - essentially a clear shell covering the back of the device. It captures the light and makes the color of the plastic beneath it really pop. The dual layers are also intended to keep the Asha 500 and its brethren away from scratches and damages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the new transparency layer, the new Asha phones sport basically the same design as the Asha 501 they replace. Colorful as ever, the new phones will be available in black, bright red, bright green, yellow, and cyan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The button layout of the Asha 500 (502 and 503, too) hasn't changed at all - the volume rocker and Power/Lock key are located on the right hand-side and feel solid as ever. The hardware Back button is the only control below the screen and doesn't protrude as much as on the Asha 501.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware might've not changed that much, but the software sure has. Nokia has revamped the Asha software, updating the Fastlane experience as well as including a new swipe shortcut for quickly launching the camera - it's done with a swipe up from the lockscreen. You can also swipe left and right to access snapped images and camcorder mode, respectively, and there's also one tap sharing to Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the addition of WhatsApp messaging application, the Asha are now more social than ever. Typing on the tiny keyboard is still somewhat of a struggle and isn't really a possibility for people with larger hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the differences between the three little fellas are small, but essential, considering the kind of users they target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 500 sports a QVGA 2.8" display and is 2G-only. At the back, there's a 2MP snapper with no flash. In comparison, the Asha 502 and 503 feature a bit larger 3" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 502 is again just 2G-enabled, but sports a bit smaller 1,010 mAh battery. However, the microSD slot with support of 32GB of additional storage and 5MP camera with LED flash make up for the smaller juice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Asha 503 adds 3G to the equation and sports the aforementioned 5MP camera with LED flash, microSD card slot as well as the larger 1,200mAh battery. It also sports Gorilla Glass 2 screen protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 500 and Asha 503 are available in both single and dual-SIM configurations, unlike the Asha 502, which only has a dual-SIM version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the Asha 501 was released to the market, Nokia asked $99 for it, so the $69 price tag of the Asha 500 is a nice step towards broader market appeal. The Asha 502 and 503 will cost $89 and $99, respectively with an expected launch in Q4 of this year in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East. Latin America will see the launch of the Asha 500 and 503 around that time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the new Asha smartphones are a step in the right direction for the Finns. Some people may find the "ice protected" casing not to their liking, but it's hard to argue that they deliver a compelling set of features for their respective price points.</paragraph>
