			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 is our first glimpse into the new Xseries and we?re excited to see how things have changed since XpressMusic ran the show. And they have changed, the new angular look is a testament to that. The S40 on the inside has changed as well, throwing Ovi Store and basic multi-tasking into the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the Xseries is composed of two completely different phones. The Nokia X6 is a touch phone running Symbian, and the X3 is an affordable Series 40 slider. It packs stereo speakers, excellent audio quality and a built-in FM radio antenna for a complete sonic experience. All right, we said affordable, so don?t go looking for top-notch gear beside the obvious full music package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 runs the Series 40 6th edition but it?s unlike any S40 handset we?ve seen before. For a brief, joyful moment, we thought Nokia have finally given in and added multitasking. The truth turned out to be different but still there were small steps taken in the right direction. And you should see what they?ve done with the Gallery ? it?s only a notch bellow the S60 one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s not get ahead of ourselves and let?s take a look at the Nokia X3 pros and cons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs look like nothing to be excited about but a shortish feature list never tells the whole story. So, think before you go ?Nah, it sounds lame?, because you?ll be wrong about sound. We spent several days with it and now we?re ready to tell you the story behind those specs, the good, the bad and the ugly, the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do we have your interest? Good. Jump to the next page where we open the box and take a look at the Nokia X3. After the hardware inspection we?ll try to explain what the deal is with this multitasking-but-not-quite situation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X3 unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia X3 covers the basics. In the box you'll find a charger, a shortish microUSB cable, a 3.5mm headset and a BL-4CT battery. The headset is one piece, which means you?ll have to give up the remote if you want to use another set. There's a user manual of course, and a 2GB microSD card to get you started.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X3 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia X3 measures 96 x 49.3 x 14.1 mm for a volume of 65.8 cc. The handset is neat, with very clean lines and simple styling. The X3 is a compact slider with a pleasingly solid feel and likeable materials. The weight of 103 g is in the sweet spot for a phone of that volume. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 moves away from the rounded corners of most recent Nokia handsets, and goes for bold, straight lines. The soft plastic on the back and the faux brushed metal finish of the keypad and backside of the slider combine comfort with style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is a classic Nokia slider. It houses the display with two colored stripes on each side, the left of which comprises the three dedicated music keys. The red color accents are a familiar XpressMusic styling cue. Below the display are the S40 standard D-pad, surrounded by the soft and call keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notch of an earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo up front. The handset lacks an ambient light sensor and display brightness is non-configurable. The music keys are thin but easy enough to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2? screen seems tiny compared to the overall size of the Nokia X3 and spoils the looks of the phone ? it just makes it look cheap. Cheap it is, but most of the exterior does a pretty good job of masking that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn the phone on, disappointment with the display grows even bigger. The contrast is poor and the colors are way off. The viewing angles are atrocious ? if you?re not looking at it dead on, the colors begin to wash out. And sunlight legibility is very poor as well rather surprisingly for a Nokia phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the display performance just about beats an entry level color screen from a few years back (think CSTN quality).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display are the D-pad, the soft keys and the Call and End keys. The navigation frame of the D-pad is nicely projecting over a very spacious and responsive confirm key. The soft and call keys are flat, the whole plastic deck sinking when they are pressed. The keys have a satisfying click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up unveils the alphanumeric keypad, which takes the entire lower deck of the phone. The keypad is flat, with the symbols etched out on a plastic plate with brushed metal finish. Vertical and horizontal ridges separate the keys, making touch orientation very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top row is actually taller than the other rows, leaving plenty of headroom. Still, it?s not a heavy texter?s keyboard, but casual users will find it quite comfortable. And the speaker grill bellow the brushed metal looks quite appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of sliding, it?s time to talk about the second major disappointment with the Nokia X3 hardware after the display. The slider?s spring is assisted, but the two parts of the chassis rub against each other too much to making the spring nearly useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feel of plastic-sliding-over-plastic is not very pleasant either. The strangest thing is there?s about a millimeter between the two parts of the slider, which also makes a bad impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia X3 you'll find the microUSB data port under a neat plastic cap. Next to it is the 3.5mm audio jack and the standard Nokia charger port, both of which are left out uncovered. Charging off microUSB is possible, but the standard issue charger has the regular 2mm charger plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grill of one of the stereo speakers separates the two parts of the slider at the top. The bottom is clear, save for the second loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right and left side of the handset are quite neat ? the left side has the microSD card slot hidden under a flap, just above the lanyard eyelet, and the right has the volume rocker and camera keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is made of soft matte plastic, which is pleasant to the touch and fingerprint-immune. A dotted pattern on the top and bottom break up the plain look ? the only other things of interest are the engraved Nokia logo and the camera lens, framed by a thin line of brushed metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When open, the top part of the slider reveals more of that brushed metal finish on its back to reinforce the overall solid feel of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass covering the camera lens is exposed at all times, so you have to handle the phone with care or risk scratching it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover slides out easily, and doesn?t wobble when in place. Below it you'll find the 860 mAh (BL-4CT) Li-Ion battery and the SIM compartment bellow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 feels good in the hand, though the rough slider action spoils the experience. That and the awful display, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint-hiding matte plastic on the back along with the brushed metal make the X3 look good, and perhaps a bit too serious. The overall looks closely mimic those of the Nokia X6, but the X6 has the high-tech sophistication, which, the X3 can?t quite pull off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface has a go at multi-tasking, but fails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 employs the Series 40 6th edition user interface, but it was updated since we saw it in the Nokia 6700 classic with some very welcome surprises. The environment is still well familiar - on the surface, the only things that seem to have changed are the revamped Messaging section, the greatly improved Gallery and some tweaks to the menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was also a little surprise. Lack of multitasking has been the bane of S40 for a while now ? all the Sony Ericsson, LG and Samsung feature phones just make the S40 ?dumb?-phones look bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a short moment, our hearts fluttered with excitement when we were prompted to close an application, as there were too many of those already running. We were presented with a task manager of sorts ? it could only close apps, not switch between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But after five minutes of pressing every button on the phone, trying to figure out how to bring up the real task manager (and failing), we noticed something. All the apps that appeared to run in the background shared one thing ? they keep an Internet connection open to check for updates: a new email arriving, a new IM, Ovi Store getting updates in the background and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that was it. Small components of those apps are running in the background sharing the phone?s Internet connection. Apparently, there?s a limited number of apps that can use the connection simultaneously. Launching the full app takes as long as usual and they don?t resume where you left off. In other words, it?s as if you?re starting them for the first time. So there?s no real multi-tasking on the X3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in browser and Ovi Maps are the only ones that exhibit signs of multi-tasking (though rudimentary), but more on that later.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going back on topic, the standby screen of the Nokia X3 features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The D-pad directions can be set up as shortcuts - by default, left brings up the new message menu and right the Calendar. Font color on the main display can be customized too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available. It consists of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The second section displays the currently playing track or radio channel info, with shortcuts to the players if nothing is playing at the moment. Next is the Ovi Contacts application and then a shortcut to the Ovi Store, promoting the dedicated application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D animation of the menu icons has been dropped in favor of the S60 look. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven predefined ringing profiles on the Nokia X3, which should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. They can be set to expire at a given time, returning the phone to the previous profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode is on hand too, turning off all transceivers and allowing to use the phone without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software is a mixed bag. The interface is quick and responsive, however there were several occasions where an application would terminate unexpectedly (it happened to the browser mostly). There are several other issues we had with the software (e.g. Flickr refused to work with the preinstalled app, Ovi Share had problems too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the changes to the Gallery are excellent and the multitasking ? even if basic ? is a welcome update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A super fit phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia X3 stores up to 2000 contacts and that should be more than enough. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First names are stored separately from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign ringtones to each contact. There?s also an option for a video ringtone, which will run on an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: regular Name List, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Image. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at once. Contacts can be ordered by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can be either normal or large - that option that will definitely be appreciated. The bigger font fits just as many contacts on the screen by leaving a smaller gap between the lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And lastly, the well-known grouping option is also present. This means that contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra is the Find-on-Map option, which locates the contact's address on the new Ovi Maps app for S40 if it?s been entered correctly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts integrates tightly with the Nokia X3 phonebook as a new tab and offers an IM client with a twist. You can search for people already registered with Ovi or send an invitation to anybody using Gmail since the Ovi contacts supports G-Talk, Google's own IM, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can even go as far as sharing the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy but here's the stumbling block ? despite the updates it received, S40 still doesn't have multitasking. And since Ovi Contacts is a Java app rather than a native one, you can give up any hopes of switching seamlessly between it and the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have rigged a way around this - you have the option to remain online when you quit the app and new messages show up as notifications on the screen. Choosing to reply starts the Ovi Contacts app again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put Contacts on the homescreen, which shows the number of friends online and a message when you receive one, complete with sound notifications for a contact getting online and a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We say that Nokia "rigged" the solution because it's far from perfect - if you receive a longer message you can only see part of it on the screen, reading the entire message requires launching the app. It's just a click away but it takes a few seconds for Ovi Contacts to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?d like to delete a friend from the Contacts tab in the phonebook (that is, not from the app), then the application starts, asks you if you're sure you want to delete the contact and then closes again. All this going back and forth just to get around the lack of multitasking. Pity, indeed!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception is great and in-call sound is very clear with the Nokia X3. Like almost all current S40 midrange phones this one also features Voice Clarity, which is another way of saying that it applies some sort of background noise suppression during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is clear on both ends but even at the loudest setting it?s not really loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has not included any Smart dialing on the X3 (or any other S40 handset), so typing a number will only give you the "helpful" option of starting a countdown timer (interpreting the numbers as hours, minutes and seconds) but sadly won't search your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia X3 is a Below Average performer. You can't count on getting every call in noisiy environments, and subdued ringtones surely won't do. Vibration on the other hand is quite strong. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log on the Nokia X3 is the well-known S40 application. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is capable, gets Conversations view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department leaves us little room for complaint. The Nokia X3 is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new thing here is the Conversations view, which is enabled by default. You can switch to the old Inbox view if you like, but we much prefer the threaded SMS functionality of the Conversation view. With it instead of individual messages you get a list of contacts you?ve had an SMS exchange with, the one with the latest message comes up on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages are displayed as speech bubbles with the arrow pointing down for sent texts and up for received messages. You can manage whole conversations or individual messages within a conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type. A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio messages have a separate editor, which can either record the message on the fly or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a separate IM application that works with the Ovi service, but that mostly doubles the functionality of Ovi Contacts. Unlike Contacts however, the IM app stays logged on for only 10 minutes after you leave the application (remember there is no real multitasking). We?ll take a closer look at the Ovi Contacts application as it works much better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email's got a new paintjob<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email client got a redesign and does pretty well. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the new skin, the functionality is identical to that of previous versions. Not that that?s a bad thing, quite the opposite. Setting up an account with the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password, and the X3 took care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice. There's an option to keep the connection active, then you will be notified for new messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A brand new gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 gallery has never been our favorite, maybe because it was trying to do the job of both a File manager and a media browser. But in this latest incarnation of S40, things have vastly improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering the Gallery now presents you with three options ? Photos, Music &amp; videos and All content. ?All content? brings up the good old Gallery. It?s meant to serve as a File browser and as such it does quite alright. You can move, copy files and folders, either one by one or in bulk, you can rename them, add new ones and search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music &amp; videos section is not very interesting ? it just sends you straight to the Media player in Library view, so it?s not really new functionality. The Media player offers nice capabilities to organize songs in different categories and so on. As far as media browsers go, it has pretty much everything covered save perhaps for searching for a song by name (if the file browser can do it, why won?t the media player?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the major change in the S40 multimedia department is the Photos section of the Gallery. It organizes photos in three ways. The first and simplest is All photos ? it arranges all the photos in a 3 by 4 grid of thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second is Albums, which lets you create new Albums, add photos to albums and launch slideshows from a specific album, or upload the album to Flickr or Ovi Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each album has a title and a thumbnail of one of its photos. When you choose to add photos to an album, you are presented with all photos and just tag the ones you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last option is Timeline, which groups photos by date. Small boxes at the bottom of the screen mark the days, with the month and date written bellow them. When you select a day, a label above the boxes shows the number of photos for that date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a photo has changed a lot too. Opening a photo from a thumbnail is done with a smooth zooming transition. The next change that is immediately apparent is that zooming is now smooth, unlike before when you can only zoom in two steps. Zooming and panning are smooth and fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an option to ?Save zoomed view? (or print, or send it), which works as a quick and dirty way to crop photos. The slideshow option is here as well, with several transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The zoom and crop trick isn?t the only editing option ? S40 used to offer only the basic editing tools, but now you can have more fun with it. You get the basic tools such as crop, rotate, flip, auto enhance along with brightness and contrast adjustment and color correction that works for the three primary colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add text, clip art, frames, one of twelve effects (B&amp;W, Sepia, Negative, Emboss, Blur, Sharpen and so on) and one of five warping effects (Swirl, Bulge, Stretch, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the handy option to save the edited photo in a separate file so you don?t lose the original. Photos are edited in their full resolution, unlike early editions of S40, which downsized photos when editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only noticeable omission is the ability to view photos in landscape mode. Given all the advanced functionality, to the option to view photos in landscape orientation seems like a no-brainer. You can?t tag photos either (like in the S60 gallery) but that?s nothing we can?t live without.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the nicest applications on the Nokia X3. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art, and support for a fair number of formats. The theme can be set to match that of the rest of the phone, integrating it very well with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound through the stereo speakers is crisp and clear. You?d get the urge to unplug the headphones and let the music play out loud more than once. Unfortunately the maximum volume level is just not as high as we?d like (check the Telephony chapter). The D-pad light can pulse to the rhythm of as song, which isn?t much but it?s fun nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the dedicated music keys or the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of the Nokia X3 sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB and naturally the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience is enhanced by equalizer presets. There are 5 equalizer presets on Nokia X3 but you can easily create new ones thanks to the two user available slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be active for the info to be displayed. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia X3 performed excellently in every part of our test. The frequency response is great and the distortion levels are kept well under control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other readings are also pretty satisfying ? stereo crosstalk, noise level and dynamic range are among the best we have seen. Here goes the table and the graph so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X3 frequency response graph compared to Nokia 5230 and Nokia 5630 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS and a built-in antenna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia X3 is the FM radio. It features a built in antenna, so you don?t even have to plug in a headset to turn it on. If there is no headset plugged in, the radio plays straight on the stereo speakers, making it a great portable radio. It?s important enough to warrant a dedicated shortcut in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio application has a new look too, not that it changes the functionality much. RDS support is available. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does WMV, but not DivX<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia X3 is compatible with 3GP, MP4 and WMV formats (WMV codec more specifically as not all .wmv files use that). Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The option to hide soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also improves the viewing experience. The player works in the background appearing on the active standby tab.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No-frills 3MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 is armed with a 3.2 megapixel camera for image resolution of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the low price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available customizable settings include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.The sequence shooting option is missing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lacks autofocus and LED flash, so even if you?re satisfied with point-and-shoot quality, the Nokia X3 is far from capable of being a primary camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X3 camera doesn't rank among the top 3.2 megapixel shooters. Image quality is about average. In favorable light you can get decent images, oversharpened, but with good color rendering. Noise levels are quite high and the aggressive noise reduction makes parts of the image look like an oil painting. The lack of detail in images is a major weakness, there are nasty chromatic aberrations too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed isn't remarkable and saving files is average, rounding off the Nokia X3 as an unexceptional imaging device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia X3. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording from the dark ages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Nokia X3 manages QVGA resolution at about 10 fps, though they look more like 5fps. The 3GP video clips length is only limited by the memory available. The choppy frame rate and the awful image quality mean you might be able to use a video or two for MMS but that?s about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia X3 sample video shot at QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity on the slow side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 connectivity options are considered low-end by today's standards, 3G is hardly a novelty any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic connectivity options - EDGE and GPRS - are as far as the X3 goes. Bluetooth version 2.0 with A2DP is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also at hand and works well with 16GB microSD cards. The fact that it?s hot-swappable helps a lot too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cutting-EDGE browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3 has an integrated WebKit-based HTML web browser. We guess that rings a bell. Apple's Safari and Mobile Safari are based on WebKit, as well as the browser for the Android platform and the Palm Pre. It's safe to say that Nokia X3 is in good company. Oh well, though a bit underdressed ? in terms of connection speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As promised, we?re back to ?multitasking?. It?s not multitasking really, but you can do basic tasks while running the web browser. In the Options menu there?s a new sub-menu called Quick links. It let?s you make a call, create a new message or go the Conversations menu (or Inbox, if you?ve switched to it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s it. However, as limited as it is, it?s miles ahead of previous versions of S40. Not only can you receive calls but you can make calls, same for SMS and MMS. It?s not switching between apps, but in 2002 it would have been a great feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the interface of the browser may be disappointing, but its WebKit heart doesn?t fail. The built-in browser renders pages better than the preinstalled Opera Mini 4.2. It's mostly minor bugs but nonetheless - the native app is more accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling is reasonably fast and smooth, but on a 2.2? QVGA screen you shouldn?t set your hopes too high. Adobe Flash is not supported either - there's some rudimentary support but it's just enough to display certain banners, not play YouTube videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that streaming full-size video over EDGE is something to look forward to. Lack of landscape mode and Google search (or any other engine for that matter) is another downer for the WebKit web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the native app is a full-blown web browser, unlike the Opera Mini. The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into a lighter format to the device. This makes it perfect for low-power devices like feature phones and things like scrolling don't strain the hardware as much. But still, it?s more like cheating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing is that Opera compresses the images on the page, which both saves on data charges and speeds up the transfer. For example, GSMArena.com clocked in at about 450KB through the built-in browser and just 70KB through Opera Mini. The loss of quality in the images is minute on such a small screen, certainly a good trade off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both applications are preloaded and you can choose the one that suits you best. Plus, it's exciting to see that even S40 phones get such updates, though it really should have been done years ago.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia X3 is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday, anniversary and memo. Furthermore, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next-in-line is the handy To-Do manager that enables you to rank tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be assigned alerts, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other available organizing functions include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia X3 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition, a loan calculator is also there .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A lot of applications, if only they all worked<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too. There's an additional converter that gives you clothing and shoe size equivalents worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search by default, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Submitting a query launches the web browser, which makes this app somewhat useless. Or rather, it would have been if the browser had this functionality built-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Messenger is included for your IM needs. If you don't like it you can always download something else from the Ovi Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a World clock too for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Flickr app that should allow you to upload your photo's to the popular image sharing site. The problem is, it doesn?t work ? it seems that the app is out of date and there was no option to update it. The Flickr website reported an error saying the problem was in the third party app (that would be the preinstalled Flickr application).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is Opera Mini (which we already covered), as well as Share on Ovi and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store on S40 works much like on S60 smartphones. Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which shows you the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple - a list with the name and logo for each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a three star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, info on size, reviews by people who have tried it, rating (three stars max), the option to write a review yourself or send the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the Store is quite easy if the Recommended section and the Related apps list doesn't get you what you're looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Share<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ovi Share allows you to share images, video and audio files. This type of services have become very popular and Ovi Share is Nokia's way of getting its foot in the door. It's free and you have access to unlimited storage. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our app had some issues starting ? that and the Flickr app bug are getting too much for us to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is somewhat limited though in that you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the built-in one works quite well). Bear in mind that even 3 megapixel photos can cost you quite a lot at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is a what Ovi Maps used to be before the Ovi rebrand. However Nokia decided to keep the Nokia Maps name for the S40 platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By now you should be aware that the Nokia X3 doesn't have built-in GPS, but Maps can work without one - you can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, but you'll have to do without voice guided navigation. It won't give you your general location based on GSM cell triangulation like Google Maps does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our X3 came with no preloaded maps, but with the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges, all for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the option to download the maps over the air as you go, but we wouldn?t recommend it, even if you have a data plan. EDGE just isn?t fast enough for today?s standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you pair the phone with a Bluetooth GPS unit, it turns into a full-fledged navigation decice. Turn-by-turn visual and voice guidance are available if you purchase a separate navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. The contents of Favorites can have different icons and can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was great to see that Nokia Maps for S40 has grown the same Quick links pseudo-multitasking as the browser. This way, you can pull off the road to make a call, without having to exit the Maps app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games ? time wasters galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are five games preinstalled ranging from quick and simple to some slightly more serious. They should be more than enough to kill a few minutes of boredom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Bounce tales - a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An all time classic is here - Snake, version 3. It offers classic mode or adventure mode, which puts a slightly different twist to the game. There's even Bluetooth multiplayer mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>City Bloxx is the well-known block stacking game. Be warned, it's addictive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Diamond rush it?s Sokoban meet Indiana Jones. Find the hidden treasures and push boulders out of the way, but be careful not to block your route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are fan of the console series, Guitar Hero and its siblings, then this one is perfect for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Block?d is a version of Jawbreaker, where you have to ?pop? series of adjacent balls (or in this case cubes) of the same color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Rally Stars adds a bit of 3D racing to the otherwise mostly arcade mix. Just don?t expect Need-for-Speed-level graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to admit the Nokia X3 is a tough sell, and that has almost nothing to do with the competition. In fact, there are only few top manufacturers that take music phones as seriously as Nokia. So, whether it?s XpressMusic or X3 (we like that one better), Nokia phones are having a ball. But there are so many of them scattered across different price ranges and platforms that any newcomer inevitably risks not getting enough attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X3 ventures to offer many nice UI features such as active standby, threaded messaging, Ovi Contacts, Maps for S40, the new image gallery and the Ovi Store and it?s a versatile portable music player with an accent on FM radio among everything else. But it does look sloppy ? both in terms of hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you look past the bad slider (maybe we just got a bad sample), it?s hard not to balk at that poor display. And what about loudness ? a Below Average result from the loudspeaker of a music phone? Sure, music sounds quite good on it, but only if you can hear it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software part we wish we saw real multitasking on S40. Competing manufacturers have long offered that on their feature phones. A document viewer wouldn?t have hurt either. Some social networking integration won?t be bad too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there are also the the software bugs that irked us. Getting an app for your highly promoted service that doesn?t work properly straight out of the box looks kinda bad to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, we quite liked the Nokia X3 for its musical prowess, but the competition is tough, so we have to wonder if the X3 will make its mark or will it just be the Nokia X6 rouge brother that nobody in the family likes to talk about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let?s break it down for you as we see it. Close to that price range the Nokia 6303 classic can match the Nokia X3 spec for spec, and it even has an autofocus camera with a LED flash and VGA@15fps video recording. It?s more compact and has some metal on the body. On paper, the screen is the same size and resolution, but in reality, it?s much better. On the downside, it only has one speaker, comes with a 1GB microSD card, supporting only 4GB cards. But, the Nokia 6303 classic is cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6303 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5235 Comes With Music is another option ? a 3.2? touchscreen of 360x640 pixel resolution, 3G with 3.6Mbps HSDPA, Symbian skills and a built-in GPS. Oh, and 12 to 16 months of free subscription to the Comes With Music service, which means you can download all the music you want without paying a penny. If you already have a big music collection, you can just go for the Nokia 5230, which loses the 3G and GPS for Wi-Fi and a slimmer profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5235 Comes With Music ? Nokia 5230 ? They look exactly the same</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a previous generation Nokia music phone ? the 5630 XpressMusic. It?s small, it weighs 83g, runs Symbian on a fast 600MHz CPU, has 3G with 10.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA, Wi-Fi and though it costs more, it comes with a 4GB microSD card. It?s also got the audio quality to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5630 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All told, we can?t help but wonder if the Nokia X3 is not an old, forgotten design Nokia stumbled upon and decided to dust off. There are better phones on the market already, so the prognosis for the Nokia X3 doesn?t look good. But Symbian and touchscreen are not everyone?s cup of tea, so a new generation music feature phone can hope to do reasonably well in the lower midrange. And the Nokia X3 price tag is an important ingredient in the mix.</paragraph>
