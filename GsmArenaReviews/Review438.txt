			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the successful Walkman-mobile W800i was followed by a new model - W550, which was a little bit cheaper at the expense of certain technological equipment. Sony Ericsson W550 attracted customers with both its top-class MP3 player and its swivel construction. The last Sony Ericsson model from the Walkman line so far is the W900 model, in which the manufacturer has apparently tried to install everything techno fans long for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Sony Ericsson W900</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Be careful with the orange<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As obvious from the pictures, Sony Ericsson W900 is pretty big. It has been a week now since I started using it and I cannot get used to its size. It disturbs me no matter which pocket I put it in. Eventually, I decided to make use of my backpack's special mobile phone pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Pure elegancy </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W900 comes in a stylish plastic box </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 is the biggest among all its "cousins". Its construction is based on Sony Ericsson S700, so their dimensions are identical. BTW, the new Sony Ericsson W900 reaches 165 mm long when opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Comparing SE W900's dimensions with a credit card, with Sony Ericsson D750 (which is the same like W800) and with Nokia 6681 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I could get used neither to phone's size, nor to its rotating construction. When I am working with closed phone and I need to start to write a text, I have to only push the phone's upper part with my thumb and it opens of itself. Not bad at all, I agree, but in this very moment I find out that I am holding the phone upside down. And again, when I need to close the phone, the move with the thumb turns to be scant for the spring mechanism does not help me anymore. I have no choice, but to use both my hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at the phone's handling (AVI, DivX 5.2, 1.6 MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger size makes both handhold and control more comfortable o closing the phone with one hand only is problematic </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction of Sony Ericsson W900 is very solid, including the joint. It did not give out a single creak, although I bended and twisted the back cover quite a lot. At the same time though, the sound of phone's two parts locking together is pretty cheap. Both the friction between plastic surfaces and the following clap are much too loud. In all other aspects Sony Ericsson W900 gives the impression of a luxury device with silky covers. The latter are truly elegant, yet fingerprints-prone. Fortunately, the relief of the phone's surface is broken, so fingerprints are usually visible on the display and the back cover only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The model we are testing is white. The combination of white color and glossy plastic covers reminds me of the most famous MP3 player ever - Apple iPod. Sony Ericsson W900 is also available in black. According to our humble opinion, the black color suits this phone far more than the white one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black looks better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we are having a Walkman to do with, orange is a must. Sony Ericsson W900's design is more modest in comparison with the forerunner W550, which was literally swimming in orange. The only elements elaborated in orange here are the logo below the display, the frame around the control button and its legends, and the fine frame around the camera lens on the rear side of the device. When you open the phone you will see other two orange logos - one is located below the keypad, the other one is on the back side of the display part. Orange elements go perfectly with the orange menu scheme on the display, when the latter is alight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Glossy covers look elegant and fashionable, but catch fingerprints </paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Pleasant both at look and touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900's display is one of the best on the current market. It occupies a lot of the space on phone's front cover. It has 240 × 320 pixels with 262K colors. Below the display there is a group of functional keys, dominated by a control button with confirming central element. The control button is chromium-plated. The functional keys gathered around it are elaborated in the same color like the plastic material that surrounds them. Here you will find a pair of context keys accompanied by the Back and the C buttons. The lower line constitutes of special functional keys, which provide access to Internet, establish a video call connection and open the Activity menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Display is big ? a camera for video conversations is located above the display ? the quality of the display is outstanding</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The phone only needs to be open when you enter a number or text. The rest of the functions can be controlled with the device closed. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>More buttons are to be found on the sides of Sony Ericsson W900. On its right side there is a traditional volume button, which controls both the volume and the zoom, and a camera release button. On its left side you will find a tiny chromium-plated button, which starts the music player, and a sliding key that locks the keypad. BTW, this type of locking system is usually quite practical. In this particular model, however, the rotating construction may puzzle you as to where the locking button should be looked for. When the phone is open, the locking key is on the right, when closed, it is on the left. No matter how simple it sounds, it is in fact quite confusing. Besides, the keypad lock suffers from another drawback, the most serious to my opinion: it gets automatically deactivated when the phone is opened, which happens at the slightest swing of the rotating part. When you close the phone again, the keypad lock does not resume anymore. Due to this I would often pull the phone out of my pocket only to see that its display is covered with gibberish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Volume button </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Music button, keypad lock and memory card slot on one side ? volume key, camera release button and infrared port on the other</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of control however the entire keypad is worth a compliment. The navigating key is big enough; its protruding margin facilitates the control process, while its middle part creates a comfortable pillow for the thumb. All functional keys move quietly; their uplift is relatively minor. When you confirm selected options, a clear click can be heard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Keypad is brilliant; the only inconvenience here is its distribution into two levels </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric section of the keypad consists of separate large buttons, whose surface slightly differs from the surrounding plastic material. However the difference is however recognizable and facilitates orientation in the dark. Keys' touch is fluent and allows for fast SMS writing. Considering the abundance of space on W900's surface, its keypad is located a bit far from the display, which I find helpful, for it prevents this long device from bending over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keypad is very interesting. In the dark entire keys radiate in white with a slight green nuance. Due to poor light distribution, however, stray streaks on the keys are clearly visible. In result, the final effect is quite impressive, no matter how much intention was placed in it, if any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   In this particular case the unevenness of the backlighting seems intentional </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Durability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most attractive element on the back side of the device is the assembly of the camera lens, the tiny mirror and the LED flash, all framed in orange. The camera is not protected by a removable cover as usual in other Sony Ericsson models, which is a pity. Next to the camera lens there is a grid covering the loud speaker and a blank connector for the external antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The camera lens is not protected with a cover, unfortunately ? as usual, the grid hides the loud speaker</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery and its removable cover dominate the rear cover of the phone. The accumulator is lithium-polymer with a capacity of 900 mAh. According to official sources SE W900 has a stand-by of 370 hours and can back up 500 minutes of phone calls. Of course, the truth usually is somewhere else. During three days I had Bluetooth constantly active, I would leave the phone on through the night, I listened to music for approximately an hour, I had a 10-minute video conversation and 20 minutes of phone calls, and I played an infinite number of games, sent plenty of messages and browsed the internet quite frequently. SE W900 managed it all. It ran out of energy on the fourth day. Charging is over within an hour and a half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery's bed </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among other things on the right side of the phone you will also find the infrared port, whose dark plate does not go with the surrounding design at all. The opposite side of the device features a tiny system LED and the memory card slot, which is protected by a rubber cover. The system connector located in the bottom side is also protected by a cap. When the phone is opened, however, it appears on the top, which makes it really difficult to access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   System connector is protected by a cap, which is not easy to lose</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory cards can be replaced while the device is running</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Earphones plugged into the system connector</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Orange World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you switch on the phone, an orange menu pops out asking you, whether you want to run the entire phone or just its music application. Even though this type of welcoming is not new, let me explain to all beginners that running the music player alone without activating the phone section of the device saves a significant amount of energy. If you do not want to respond to this request every time you turn on the phone, simply deactivate it. Phone's initial activation also implies a guide manual, which provides you with short description of W900's basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>View at the menu (AVI, DivX 5.2, 2.7 MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The configuration of the stand-by display is similar to all other Sony Ericsson models. You can create your own background by placing animated pictures. A pre-installed original animated Walkman logo is available too (white logo on orange background, of course). The main menu is also orange. It is decorated with traditional transient animations, which I myself find a little bit slower than the ones in Sony Ericsson K750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Stand-by display with different wallpaper and a color theme </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole main menu, including its icons organized in a matrix, is a piece of detailed graphic art. If the orange dominance tires you, choose one of the three other color schemes and activate it. Many additional color schemes can be downloaded from the internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Main menu in various graphic themes </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a special screen saver function, whose purpose is more entertaining than practical, for it makes the selected picture or animation appear on the screen after a few seconds of display inactivity without saving even a bit of energy. One huge drawback of Sony Ericsson W900 in comparison with older models like W800 or W550 is that it does not display a stand-by clock. After a minute or so of inactivity the display goes out completely and shows no additional information, not even missed calls or messages. The brightness level of the display is adjustable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Tabs in the menu in various themes </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Activity menu is accessed by the use of a special button. A separate button has been also assigned to the music player application. It is located on the upper way of the main control button. The other four ways are not predetermined and thus can be setup according to user's will. Standard functions of the context keys are fixed - the left key opens the record of received, dialed and missed calls, while the right one gets you to the main menu. To my opinion, the right context key should have been left free for the majority of users would choose to enter the main menu by pressing the middle section of the control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Activity menu ? a short press on the side button shows phone status</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What does exactly Activity menu stand for? It is a separate menu that consists of three fields. The left one contains all missed events (calls, reminders, messages); the middle one covers a configurable list of most frequently used functions, while the right one is reserved for user's favorite internet links. This menu is highly practical and - as many K750 users will surely agree - also pretty addictive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-class call application<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 is perfectly equipped to manage all kinds of phone services. The only obstacle in this sense is its rotating construction, which complicates the overall control of the phone. While the numeric keypad comes handy when you search the phonebook, phone calls are executed more easily when the phone is closed, because the volume control buttons located on phone's side are easier to access. What I do not manage to understand is why a rotating phone like W900 does not use rotation for call answering and ending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has undergone no modifications; except for the fact that the bigger display, which shows 6 contacts at a time, makes it look more panoramic. The new Sony Ericsson' phonebook fits in 1000 multi-field contacts (500 more in comparison with the W800 model). On the other hand, the phonebook in the cheaper W550i has no less than 1000 contacts either. Contacts can be sorted into groups, which mainly serve for bulk message sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Phone book ? context menu for selected names ? editing contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information to go with each contact is entered in a well-organized tabbed structure. The first tab contains the relevant name and phone number, the second keeps emails and internet sites, the following tab contains a picture, a ringing melody and voice orders etc. Each contact name can be assigned up to 27 fields. Here are some of them: 5 phone numbers, 3 email addresses and a full street address - both home and at work. As I already mentioned, each contact can be accompanied by a picture, which appears when the relevant contact person calls you, and identified by a particular melody, which plays on the same occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each number in a contact entry is marked with a symbolic icon to differ it from the others. When you select a contact person, a list with all fields starting with the relevant default number unfolds. Use the horizontal ways of the control button to search the list, including emails. Further on, you can choose, whether you want to call the selected number in the usual way (by pressing the left context key), or through a video conversation (by pressing the correspondent button), or you prefer to send a message (this option is accessed from the context menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching can be even faster if you apply the voice dialing function. Each of the numbers saved under a certain contact can be given a separate label. To dial one of these labels you need to long-press one of the volume control buttons and pronounce the label. A matter of course is the Shortcut option. It assigns a particular number key to frequently dialed phone numbers. Once you have done this, you need to only press the relevant key and start dialing. If you long-press it, it will take you directly to the respective letter in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Call records ? selecting a ringing profile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W900 audio reproduction is good. The sound is clear and loud enough. The people I called did not complain about it either. They did not make any difference between calls executed with open phone and those made when the phone was closed. Ringing sounds are praiseworthy as well. In comparison to the D750 model, for example, Sony Ericsson W900's sound is mellower, with accentuated bass elements. Naturally, you are free to select your preferred ringing sound with the help of pre-installed ringing profiles. To quickly mute the phone, press and hold the grid-protected button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When words are not enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apart from the GSM frequencies, Sony Ericsson W900 also supports UMTS and thus allows for making video conversations via the tiny camera located on its front side. Video conversations are established in a relatively slow pace, but obviously, such a drawback is not due to a defect in the device. In a few seconds you will see the other part's video image on the display, while your own image is viewed in a small window in the down left corner of the screen. This window is perhaps much too small, because one needs to pay extra attention on staying in focus. On the other hand, you can switch between the two images or deactivate the smaller one for good. Both options are accessed from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Video conversation, environment (instead of this picture you will see the calling party) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>W900 offers a 2x digital zoom. Brightness setup and night-mode are two of the other options that can be found in the context menu. In addition, you can choose, whether the opposite part of the video conversation should see your actual video image or just a selected steady picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You would do better if you make video conversations with plugged in earphones or perhaps even with a Bluetooth handset for the speaker is often quite unpractical. You may also want to show your video partner the image captured by the camera on the back side of the phone. To switch to it close the device and then press the left context key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along video conversations both parties can share their picture. Press the right arrow to go to the second tag, in whose right part you will see previews of all pictures saved in the phone. Select one of them and send it by a single press on the appropriate button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Sharing pictures during a video conversation </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text, picture and sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 manages SMS, MMS, and emails. In this aspect the phone is comparable to all Sony Ericsson's previous high-class models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor offers five lines of text capacity, which is not much, considering the size of the display, but it is not too bad either. Traditionally, Sony Ericsson does not permit changes in the font size. Writing is facilitated by the T9 dictionary. It offers the most frequently used words and seems quite practical. It learns new words as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Messages menu ? writing a SMS ? creating a MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of written characters appears at the very end of the created SMS. This however does not have a negative impact on the practical aspect of the entire application. In each message you can insert simple EMS pictures or MMS (to insert a MMS, just switch to the MMS editor).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor has not been modified. It offers the same comfort as older models. A MMS can contain texts, pictures, sounds and videos, but should not exceed 300 KB. All functions are perfectly organized. In the section "Create a new message" you will also run across an option called "Voice message". This is a MMS, which consists of sound only. It is created even faster for you only need to run the voice recorder, pronounce your message and send it right on by a single press on the appropriate button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have written your message, you have to select the addressee. One of the smartest solutions in Sony Ericsson mobile phones is the possibility to search in the list of last used contacts, apart from the standard number or name searching options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All delivered text and multimedia messages are gathered in a common folder. Each type is marked by a tiny icon and thus easy to recognize. Email messages are stored separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Email menu ? creating a new email</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client has not undergone almost any modifications, so let me describe it briefly. You can set up several different accounts, but the email client is able to manage only one of them at a time. Emails can be marked with a ringing melody that differs from the one used in SMS or MMS. The phone manages all types of sounds, no matter whether pre-installed or such of your own. However this function is very easy to pass over, especially in the audio setup menu (inside the audio setup menu for messages go to the last item and substitute it). Let's go back now to emails. You can download entire emails or their headers only. Incoming mail can be checked automatically in various intervals from several minutes up to 12 hours. The email client supports attachments of course. You can even send a full-resolution picture from the camera application. The phone opens incoming attachments without a problem. Unrecognized files are saved into the memory space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>High-class MP3 player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite understandably, the music player is one of Sony Ericsson W900's main functions. That explains why there are several start options available. You can use either the small button on phone's right side, or the upper way of the control button, or one of the items in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 music player is identical to the one in W800. It plays both MP3 and AAC files. According to the information provided in the ID3 tag it is also able to sort music files by artist and by album. Of course, it plays files without filled ID3 tags too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In first place in the main menu of the music player you will see a play reference, which starts the last selected list from the moment where it was interrupted. An item called Artists is second in order. Here you will find a list of all artists, whose music tracks are present in the phone's memory. When you select an artist, a second press on the confirm button gets you to the albums' list. A click on the particular album unfolds a list with the music tracks that compose it. To start listening, press play or the middle part of the control key. The player starts from the music file you selected and then proceeds with the next one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music player's main menu ? creating a playlist</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An item called "All" appears on the first place in both the albums' and the artists' list. In the first case it unfolds a list of all music tracks from the particular artist; in the second case it opens a list of all albums from all artists altogether. To search the lists with music files use the vertical arrows of the control key. Voice search is not applicable here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>W900' music player also provides you with the option to create special music lists to your own will. To compose such a list, search the memory and mark off the music files that interest you. Files are not sorted by ID3 tags as you search the phone's structure located in the memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Playing music ? equalizer settings ? displaying track info when the music application has been minimized</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along playing both the artist's name and the name of the album and the music file appear on the display. Here you will also find other useful details - for example, what part of the file has already been played or the position of the relevant song in the entire playing list. The graph indicating the playing process is located in the bottom of the display. A short press on one of the horizontal ways of the control button takes you to the previous or to the former file. A long press takes you further on in the same file. The vertical ways of the control button open the playing list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first option to be found in the context menu is Minimize. If you apply it, the music plays on, but you are free to use any other function of the phone. When the player switches to the next track, its name appears for a moment in the upper bar on the display. Besides, the menu offers a random and repeating option, and an equalizer setup option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player plays videos as well. It reads both 3GP and MPEG4 formats. You can view picture in a full-screen mode and watch it horizontally.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Where has the radio gone?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The earphones delivered with Sony Ericsson W900 are the same like the ones we know from W800. They are of the plug-in type and are covered with rubber seals, which "get stuck" into your ears. Once you have put them into your ears, the entire world around goes totally quiet. I myself do not fancy this type of earphones and it seems that I am not alone. When I plug them in, I feel pain in my ears and not long afterwards the bass elements start causing me headache. On the other hand, I expect dance music fans to be really pleased, because the equalizer of W900´s earphones is equipped with a Mega Bass function. As to acoustic or rock pieces I would have appreciated it better if its middle and high elements were more emphasized and not so much blurred by the bass section. On the other side, if you deactivate the Mega Bass function, the bass section wears way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Plug-in earphones work well ? connection through a standard jack</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the earphones are connected to the cable through a standard 3.5mm jack connector, which permitted me to attach a pair of good-quality earphones of my own. This way I managed to satisfy my audio needs, but then I had to decide what to do with the supplying cable, which I had no choice but to wrap it around my waist. The trouble here is that the jack is mounted on a 1-meter long cable, while the cord of the earphones is 1.5-meter long. Next to the connector there is a speaker and a button for accepting incoming calls, which permits you to make calls with any type of earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Remote control ? the entire set of earphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the middle of the supplying cable you will find one of the innovations in the W900 - the remote control. It is pretty small and flat and suits the black version of the phone perfectly. On its front cover there is a button and a tiny black &amp; white display. On its sides you will find a volume control button and a special button, which plays and stops music, switches from one music piece to another, and tunes the radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And so we come to the most serious question: where has the radio disappeared? Do not look for it in the phone, because it has been installed in the small controller mentioned above. According to me, it is a rather unsuccessful solution. What's worse, you will have to forget about the memory reserved for favorite stations and the RDS application we all admired in the W800i model. The simple radio application only displays information about broadcasted frequency on the controller's display. Besides, every change from one station to another requires separate tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Control elements are located on the sides of the remote control </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side parts of the remote control, the button on its front cover and its display all flash orange in the dark. The intensity of the orange light is not very strong though, so the display is a bit difficult to read. When you play MP3 files, the display only shows orbiting lines. It will show no information from ID3 tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big button on the front side of the remote control switches between radio and MP3 player. When pressed long it switches the music on/off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera remains the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 can perfectly be used as a digital camera as well. The maximum resolution is 1632 × 1224 pixels. The same auto-focus camera can be found in Sony Ericsson K750/D750/W800 models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When taking pictures you can hold the phone with both your hands, just like you would do with a common digital camera. Well, in fact you have to do it, because the camera application will not go if the phone is open. Your right pointing finger will comfortably lie on the double-stage release button. The releasing process is standard - press slightly to focus and then press-full to take a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos in full resolution (300-500 KB):</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are taken in a landscape mode. The functional menu appears in the bottom of the display, just like in "grown-up" Sony-made cameras. Individual functions are controlled through the context keys; the cursor button opens and navigates the menu, while the Back key fulfills its standard function. All buttons are easily accessed with thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;SE W900 makes excellent macro pictures (perhaps we could have balanced the white manually...)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The horizontal ways of the control button compensate the exposure, while the vertical ones help you switch between the picture and the video application, but only when you are not in the menu. The volume control buttons below your left pointing finger control the digital zoom application. Further on in the menu you will also find other useful functions like self-timer, manual white balance, quality and size setup, creative effects etc. Sony Ericsson W900 is equipped with an option for spot metering, which speaks in its favor in comparison with existing similar Sony Ericsson models. Among them the S700 model was the only one to have it. The macro mode settings have also been modified. They are no more displayed as a part of the menu bar, but are hidden in a menu called "auto focus".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Capturing interior objects under low light conditions </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the camera application you will not miss the well known panoramic mode either. It allows for taking a panorama photo from consecutive pictures. The transparent margin of the previous picture is always visible; this way you can easily follow with an appropriate picture at your will. Let's not forget to mention the night mode and the flash LED, which are extremely helpful when pictures are taken in poor weather conditions. The flash diode compensates for a torch or a SOS signal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Three times the same teddy bear: the first one was taken with a flash ? the second in a night mode ? the third in a standard mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound effects during photographing are quite loud and sometime even annoying. You may choose out of four sounds for the release button or you may want to use the option to switch to silent mode instead. The latter quiets the camera mode completely (might not be presented in all firmware versions). Sony Ericsson W900 offers a self-portrait option, for the purpose of which it has been supplied with a camera located on its front cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;The flash diode compensates for a torch, if necessary </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture quality of Sony Ericsson W900 is practically identical to other 2 megapixel Sony Ericsson camera phones. In other words, it is brilliant. The only drawback worth mentioning is the amount of visible noise, which increases when pictures are taken under poor weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should not forget to mention the video application. It offers a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels in a compressed 3GP format. Videos duration is limited by the memory space currently available. The recorder also offers a white balance option, a night mode and light activation. Video records are quite good for a mobile phone. See for yourself in the following samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 1 ? passing car</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 2 ? busy crossroads </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 3 ? in the restaurant</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 4 ? sledging children (worse light conditions) </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Overwhelming abundance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia data in Sony Ericsson W900 are managed thanks to the incredible 470 MB of memory space. If it is still too little for you, you can insert an additional memory card of the Memory Stick Pro Duo type. Since the phone is equipped with enough built-in memory, the lack of a separate memory card in the original package is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager is organized better than in previous models due to several innovations. In W900 it is divided into three sections. The first one shows all available files, the second one is only for the files saved in the phone, while the third one shows only the files on the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files are sorted by type and grouped in folders. Inside each folder you can create new subfolders and this way filter your data on through copying, moving, deleting etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When pictures are viewed you are initially offered a matrix with its previews. When you click on a particular picture, it gets maximized and can be viewed in a landscape mode. Pictures in each folder can be showed in a slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picture slideshow in the phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 is delivered with a USB cable for connection to PC. You will need to first install the correspondent driver. Once you have done so, the phone appears as a new memory storage in the computer. A full-value Mass Storage function is still missing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It is not the end<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Entertainment options in Sony Ericsson W900 are so diverse that you will hardly ever get bored. It has three pre-installed games, two of which are 3D. Asphalt3D is a car race game with brilliantly elaborated 3D environment, but it is very difficult to control. In PowerBall Arcade you pick up a marble and move with it among different types of islands. This game also requires longer control training. As a matter of fact, the game new users will surely enjoy the most is QuadraPop - a variation of the old but immortal Tetris.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 supports Java MIDP 2.0, so additional games are easy to download. Nevertheless, according to jBenchmark tests, this model has slower Java application than previous Sony Ericsson models. Obviously, phone's hardware finds it difficult to manage the increased amount of pixels on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the games, the phone also has three good java applications. Quite a practical one is the unit converter. Young and inexperienced musicians will certainly appreciate the Music Mate program, which teaches you tones on the piano, basic accords on the guitar and also serves as a timekeeper. Still, the most funny of them all is the FaceWarp application, which distorts portrait pictures and then sends them directly in a MMS. FaceWarp offers plenty of deformation options. Contrary to Sony Ericsson W550, the new model lacks a RSS channel reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are you still short of fun? Then have a look at the famous triple application VideoDJ, PhotoDJ and MusicDJ. It allows for modifying videos and pictures in various ways as well as creating ringing melodies of your own. In W900 you will also find the popular option of remote PC control through Bluetooth connection and standard HID profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;VideoDJ ? PhotoDJ ? MusicDJ ? remote control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the novelties in W900 is the support of the famous Flash format (SWF file extension), used in numerous exciting animations available on the internet. Note: images in this format cannot be viewed in a landscape mode.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The only piece of news among practical applications is the new internet browser. (BTW, the same browser type is installed in the W550 model). What makes this particular browser better than the forerunners is the combination of fast data communication in 3G and a bigger display. Apparently, we will need Opera Mini no more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WAP pages in the new browser </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing the font size ? setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages can be displayed in a full-screen mode. Their font size can be modified too. The browser adapts non-sophisticated pages to the size of the display quite effortlessly, but it still has certain limits. The phone supports Java script. More details about the new browser can be found in the Sony Ericsson W550 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing standard internet pages (MobilMania and Gadgets.cz)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu, containing standard organizer functions, is quite similar to the one we know from the forerunners. The calendar, including the reminders, can be displayed in a month, week or day view. There is no option for repeated events, as usual. Each reminder can be assigned an advanced alarm, a written note, event site and - of course - defined duration period.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizer menu ? day view at events ? month view ? week view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has not been modified either. The same holds true for the Notes and the Code memo. The phone is equipped with a calculator, a stopwatch and a countdown timer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar, the task manager, all notes and the phonebook are all possible to synchronize with the PC. Connection is established through Bluetooth, a USB cable or the infrared port. Of course, the phone substitutes a modem too. If you are not able to catch 3G signal, try GPRS Class 10, it works smoothly. All necessary software is to be found on the CD delivered with the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Too much of everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W900 certainly has some of the best and richest equipment a mobile phone has ever had, but... It is quite big and heavy. Besides that, its rotating construction is not very practical. The full blackout of the display is not helpful either for it does not alert you immediately about missed events. The phone lacks a built-in radio, which disadvantages it in comparison with existing Sony Ericsson models. The most crucial obstacle for W900 to become a commercially successful phone however will probably be its price - 530 euro is simply a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, whether you will buy this phone or not depends on nothing else but your needs. If you feel attracted to the conception of a music mobile phone, then you may have to make your choice between two Sony Ericsson models - W900 and W800. The more expensive option will bring you fast data and video conversations in UMTS networks, a bigger and better display, huge built-in memory and a pair of other less important details. So is 130 euro more worth them? At the same time, Sony Ericsson W800 is more compact, it has a top-quality built-in radio and its display is pretty good, even if smaller. All this makes me think that the group of W900 fans will hardly ever become really numerous. On the other side, this will make this new Sony Ericsson model look really exclusive and mavericks will have their own back.</paragraph>
