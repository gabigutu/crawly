			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s may lack the Serenata sophistication or the feature set of i450 but it walks and talks music. And the dedicated music keys up front are just a bit of a taster. Inside the M3200 Beat s there's turn-to-mute, Samsung-style shake control and a full-blown music player. FM radio with RDS and audio recording, a brand new music recognition application and mood-based track sorting: Samsung just won't settle for less than the competition. The must-have 3.5 mm audio jack and a set of stereo speakers put the final touch, so it's music all the way or bust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's ear for music has never been in doubt. But somehow music phones have never been at the forefront of their portfolio. Music was eclipsed by Symbian in the smart dual-slide i450 and by the outlandish design in the eccentric Samsung Serenata. Well, the Beat edition by Samsung is here to say enough is enough. Samsung's consistent track record of good audio in mobile phones and the ongoing teamwork with Bang &amp; Olufsen may as well give the Beat a flying start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beat edition gives the Samsung portfolio some structure and puts a name to all those musicphone faces. There's quite a bunch of them going way back to the D810 and spanning over a load of F-line handsets. The most important thing the Beat brings to Samsung is a straight-talking music handset with classic design and competitive price. Samsung Serenata is nowhere near this description and neither is the Symbian-powered bulky dual-slide Samsung i450.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Beat is landing right in the middle of the Walkman-XpressMusic brawl. It's tempting to assume the M3200 Beat slider and its bar-shaped partner M3510 Beat b are just feelers. The low-profile music-only (or all-music, if you prefer) handsets might be setting the scene for a raid of heavier Beat troops. Even at this stage, both the devices offer high-end music features that can match almost any Sony Ericsson Walkman out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way or another, let's not keep our sonic slider waiting. Join us after the break for more on Samsung M3200 Beat s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M3200 Beat s 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 measures 96.5 x 46.9 x 16.9 mm and weights 101 grams. The neat and simple slider casing is all straight lines and clean shapes. The perfect hand fit, dedicated music keys and user-friendly keypad provide for great phone handling. The handset is offered in two colors: Gray-on-Orange and Gray-on-Lilac.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 2" display is definitely not the top choice in a slider. The form factor provides plenty of space and a 2.2" diagonal just couldn't have blown the budget out of proportion. The screen fares well enough both outside and indoors, though sunlight legibility still lags behind Nokia transflective displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there's nothing above the display but the earpiece, underneath is the real deal in the M3200 Beat. The three dedicated music keys will always start the player, no matter what application or menu you're in. The two soft keys and the D-pad complete the minimalist layout of the front. The rest is the brushed metallic surface with orange accents around the context keys and the D-pad center. The soft keys and the navigation pad are solid to press and pleasingly responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone up reveals the main alphanumeric deck topped with the Call, End and Clear knobs. Each key is well defined, tactility is excellent and there is no reason to fear typos or frown at the neat and simple layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of M3200 Beat s features the volume rocker and the music player shortcut key. A long press of the same key starts the web browser. The other two elements here are also music-related: you get a loudspeaker at the very top and the 3.5 mm jack right under.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset has the other loudspeaker grill symmetrically placed at the top, the universal port for charging, data and connecting the stereo headset. The camera key completes the list of controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M3200 Beat slider features no keys or apertures at the bottom. The top is also free from controls, the lanyard eyelet only placed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside, amidst concentric circle patterns, we find the 2-megapixel camera lens, Samsung logo and the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEpower acknowledgment. A lot has been speculated about the integration of the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEPower amplifier into the latest Samsung handsets. Some claim it's giving Samsung handsets a definite edge in terms of sound quality. Well, this speculation has been completely disproved by our audio lab tests. All the ICEPower gives Samsung is reduced power consumption, not better audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 800 mAh Li-Ion battery. It's officially quoted at 400 hours of stand-by and 7 h of talk time. In reality, 3 days of moderate use is pretty much an adequate estimation. The SIM card holder is right under the battery, along with the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung M3200 Beat s is a pleasure. Though neither thin nor exceptionally compact, it feels nice and solid in hand. The slider action is smooth and stable, and ergonomics are more than adequate. Our only concern is the slippery back cover, which makes the handset a bit too easy to drop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality and coverage have never been an issue with recent Samsung handsets we've tested. The quad-band M3200 Beat s won't let you down with call clarity, ringing is quite powerful and crisp, so you certainly won't miss an incoming call even in noisy surroundings. A music-centered handset should deliver on that count almost by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s is among the loudest handsets to have passed our loudspeaker test. Here is how the M3200 Beat s ranks along some of the other phones we've measured. More info on our test and all current results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s uses the latest non-smartphone user interface, which we last saw in the S7330 and the B2700 toughie. Both are midrange handsets, so no interface marvels were to be expected. By the same token, the M3200 Beat is putting music first in what's otherwise quite a modest package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons with corresponding alphanumeric key shortcuts. Deeper level submenus also have keypad shortcuts besides being navigated with the D-pad. Visuals are adequate and the user interface is generally fast and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home screen is quite minimalist. The basic status readings are at the top taskbar, such as signal strength, service provider, time, battery status. Additional icons also get displayed to indicate Bluetooth on, missed events, silent/vibrate mode, alarm on, etc. There a few wallpaper types to choose from: living world, image, from theme and photo slider.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization options as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual assortment of dialing customizations is of course at hand. There are six dialing animations to choose from, the last two of which vary a little according to the active theme or your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can choose among three different preinstalled themes, each well known across a wide range of feature phones of the company. The M3200 Beat has a default Samsung theme, as well as the Spotlight and Elegance Noire. If you want more, you have the option of creating your own theme in two modes - Easy and Expert.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook traditional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M3200 Beat phonebook storage is capped at 500 entries and displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Smart Dialing function. The M3200 Beat - much like many other Samsung phones - searches only in the contact's first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 2 email addresses, URLs, postal address, and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field. Contact details or your whole contact list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give access to your call history. It has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls. From the Call log, users can add separate numbers to a reject list. Upon an incoming call from a blocked number, it is displayed in the call log as usual without any indication of it being blacklisted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s handles all common types of messages: SMS, MMS, and email. The first two share the same editor. You can convert your SMS to EMS by simply applying formatting or to MMS by inserting an image or other multimedia content. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try resending it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite straightforward. It can manage POP or IMAP accounts; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval. Even SSL support is there allowing to use it with mail services that require it, such as Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file browser in Samsung M3200 is not very convenient for a music phone. The memory card is listed as a separate folder, instead of the practical tabbed browsing in recent Samsung handsets. This is quite inconvenient, especially if you frequently use the memory card. The lack of a dedicated image browser is not a surprise, and not that much of an issue after all, in a music phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. Memory card reading speed is all right - we didn't notice significant lags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested two microSDHC memory cards with Samsung M3200 - a 4GB and an 8GB unit. Both cards were recognized and we had no issues save for the initial reading. Both memory cards were full of music files and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M3200 Beat s picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening a folder that contains images. The pictures are seen as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view a picture in portrait and landscape modes too. Zooming in on a picture to see greater detail is also possible, though we must warn you that zooming in and out is quite slow and irritating.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image editing is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's a very capable application, especially for a feature phone. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung M3200 offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. However, we still doubt it anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously, especially on a 2-inch display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player: enter all the goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat b is a one of the two music-centered phones in the brand new Beat edition of the company, alongside the bar-shaped Samsung M3510 Beat b. A capable music player and some first-time music related features, along with the dedicated music keys, are the major assets of the lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M3200 Beat flaunts stereo speakers, a Bang&amp;Olufsen ICEpower audio chip, a 3.5mm audio jack, stereo Bluetooth, FM radio with RDS and FM audio recording. The built-in acccelerometer tops that with shake control and turn-to-mute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way a lot has been speculated about the integration of the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEPower amplifier into the latest Samsung handsets. Some claim it's giving Samsung handsets a definite edge in terms of sound quality. Well, this speculation has been completely disproved by our audio lab tests. All the ICEPower gives Samsung is reduced power consumption, not better audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M3200 Beat takes advantage of Samsung's latest DNSe technology (Digital Natural Sound engine). It's said to produce more pure sound, overcoming the limitations of earphones and small speakers on portable devices. Handsets implementing the DNSe technology should be able to achieve genuine 3D sound and deep bass resonance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's alternative to Walkman's Shake control is called Motion Play. It's debuting in the Samsung portfolio after a good deal of implementation in Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. Courtesy of the inbuilt accelerometer, tracks can be jumped or shuffled by a flick of the hand, paused and played by tapping and sound gets muted by turning the phone face down. The same applies to silencing an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another take at Walkman, the Samsung Beat offers mood-based track sorting. We guess it only works after the tracks have been analyzed by some desktop application and then transferred to the handset much like it does for Walkmans. The Moods section in the player didn't work with tracks already on the memory card. Our pre-release unit doesn't have any PC software to it to complete this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first in the M3200 Beat is the "Auto EQ" function. It automatically modifies the current equalizer setting to suit the genre of the music currently playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the all-Walkman-goodies-or-bust list is complete with a music recognition feature (like TrackID). It's Shazam's 'Find Music' service. By recording and sending a tune to the Shazam server, users can easily retrieve a track's name and artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Sony Ericsson TrackID service (found in Sony Ericsson C902 for example) is far more advanced. While Samsung's music recognition displays only the name of the track and the artist, TrackID retrieves the album, and provides a link to all tracks in it. Other interesting TrackID features are "Find similar Music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That sums up the music player novelties. The rest remains the same compared to latest mid-range Samsung phones. The built-in memory of 72 MB is expandable via the card slot, which can handle microSD cards of up to 8GB full of your favorite music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre, moods and composer. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. The usual equalizer presets and surround options are also available in Samsung M3200 Beat s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two extra music player themes beyond the default one, which do not differ a lot in terms of colors and looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, we are glad to finally see such a bunch of music goodies in a Samsung handset. The capable music player in the Beat edition is only short of the Walkman 3.0 in terms of interface. The visually elaborate Walkman 3.0 music player has a match for skill, but hardly style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have made a name for their cell phone audio quality and we eagerly awaited to test the Beat sound improvements brought by the DNSe technology developed by Samsung. Unfortunately, the pre-release M3200 unit seemed to have some audio output issues so we will leave the audio quality tests for a future tome when a final retail version becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M3200 Beat comes complete with an FM radio. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste. The recording option and auto-off features add to the functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is downright basic. It doesn't even support fullscreen or landscape mode, yet fast-forward and rewind are available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2 Megapixels just for the sake of having it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s has a 2 megapixel camera with maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. Sadly there's neither autofocus, nor flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera uses the usual non-smartphone interface and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot and mosaic shot), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, etc.), and white balance. The camera can be used in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is barely passable but imaging is hardly a priority in the music-centered M3200 Beat anyway. There seems to be a bit of that aggressive noise suppression we saw in the rugged B2700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples produced by the 2 megapixel camera of Samsung M3200 Beat s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the video recording capabilities of the camera. Samsung M3200 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for some of the available options. What you get is QCIF resolution at 15fps, which is only good for use in an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A separate list of settings is, as usual, in charge of exposure metering, shutter sound, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity and Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung M3200 Beat you can count on quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support. In addition, the slider also supports USB and stereo Bluetooth, both versions 2.0. A 3.5 mm audio jack completes the wired connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung M3200 Beat s offers a scaled down NetFront v3.4 web browser, known from other Samsung phones. It has basic functionality, lacking important features like landscape/full screen views, and struggles with elaborate pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the few nice features are the mini map, page size, and search-in-page option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M3200 Beat s calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important, and private.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are a voice memo recorder, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are available too. Setting up a note or a task is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games and fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer in Samsung M3200 Beat s is not only providing the music-related perks. It's also put to use in a motion based application and two games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Shake and play section includes three motion based apps: Motion Beatbox, Dice and Lottery, all quite basic. The Motion Beatbox is a music application, which plays instruments with different tempo, based on the level of shaking intensity. The Dice and Lottery are quite straightforward, as you can see in the screenshots below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, traditional Java games are given a taster of with as many as eleven trial version titles. The games the phone bundles up are Cannonball, Super action hero, Harry Potter, Tetris Mania, Asphalt 2, Midnight Pool, Millionaire 3rd edition, Freekick, Forgotten Warrior, Arch Angel, and Sonic at the Olympic games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asphalt 2 is our favorite game with wild street racing and lots of effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Millionaire 3rd edition is based on the TV show with the specific options inherent to the real show.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a track record of excellent audio and a few music-centered handsets behind them, Samsung do not exactly need to be cautiously tiptoeing the musicphone grounds heavily patrolled by XpressMusic and Walkman. But then, they are not entering with a bang either. They just drop the Beat edition right down the midrange and - surprise! - it's got all of them Walkman goodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M3200 Beat s is definitely a modest package, for both looks and skill, but music features have not been compromised a jot. It does look sufficiently armed to survive the Walkman-XpressMusic crossfire, and even shoot back. At this point, the Beat edition lacks the style to stand up to the high ranks of rival music phones, but will sure cause commotion in the midrange.</paragraph>
