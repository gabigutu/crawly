			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Deliver more for your hard earned cash, that's what the Lenovo Vibe K5 is all about. Mind you, we're not talking about the Vibe K5 Plus we already reviewed a while ago. This time it's the base Lenovo Vibe K5 - no Plus or Note in the model name means fewer add-ons and therefore an even lighter price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it's even cheaper than the K5 Plus, we hear you ask? Indeed it is, and the price is one of three downgrades (not one to complain about) compared to the K5 Plus. The other two are the display resolution (720p vs. FullHD, but 5 inches nonetheless) and the chipset (Snapdragon 415 vs 616). That's that. The model designation for the K5 is A6020a40, while the K5 Plus is A6020a46.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of it is shared between the K5 and K5 Plus and that includes the metal back (on a decidedly entry-level phone), 13MP/5MP camera combo, 2GB of RAM and 2,750mAh of a swappable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We pointed out the very same list of disadvantages in the Vibe K5 Plus, and they hold true for the K5 as well. For the most part, at least - the Vibe K5 seems to be more widely available, both alongside the Plus in certain markets and on its own in others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swapping microSD cards when you run out of storage is not a deal-breaker for most of the prospective buyers, but we figured we'd mention it nonetheless. At least the battery is replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dated Android then remains our main gripe with the Vibe K5, as that's likely what the phone will spend its entire life on, given the usual update policies for budget models. Again, weighed up against the K5's price, that's another one we could pretend we didn't see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did see the phone though, and handled it too, and that's what the next page is all about. The design and handling chapter follows right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 measures 142 x 71 x 8mm, identical to the K5 Plus. This makes it a standard-issue 5-incher in terms of size. Marginally more compact in footprint, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 is slightly thicker, with a larger battery to show for it. The Galaxy J2 (2016) is virtually the same as the K5, while the Oppo F1 is a millimeter taller, but a fraction of a millimeter thinner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 is an entry level phone, but you can't tell by just looking at it or holding it in hand. Part of the reason is the metal back, which adds an unexpected touch of premium. Sure, it's a no-nonsense design that looks just like the next phone, but it's hard to find fault with the Vibe K5's looks, especially considering its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, as is customary with metal-backed phones, the K5's rear panel isn't entirely metal, there are two plastic bits top and bottom. Typically, those are used to allow the antennas to pick up signal, but on this particular model it would appear that the metal cover itself acts as an antenna - there are contacts on both sides, as well on the inside above the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic bits get cutouts for the camera lens and flash in the top one, and the speakers in the bottom. There are in fact too speakers, which is another surprising feature in a smartphone this inexpensive, when even many flagships still make do with just one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cover is removable and comes off together with the sides, buttons and all. There's a groove in the bottom right corner to get it started, which isn't the easiest task. Once you do, the panel is out of the way in an instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the cover, you get access to the removable battery, the two microSIM slots and the dedicated microSD slot. The speakers can be seen below the battery too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing out of the ordinary on the front either - the 5-inch display is 720p here, unlike on the Vibe K5 Plus, but with the power off it looks essentially the same. Bezels aren't exactly minimal and there's also a black outline around the display itself, but those would be grounds for complaints on a more expensive phone - here it's par for the course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire face of the phone is defined by a shiny frame, which serves to protect the edges of the glass, and also as tactile clue where the display ends. It's quite obviously made of plastic, but when did we get so picky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom bezel is home to the capacitive keys, which have icons etched in the front panel. They aren't backlit, though. Above the display there's the earpiece in the middle with the front camera and sensors on either side. There is a notification LED in the right corner here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other phones have card slots on the sides, but the Vibe K5 keeps them tucked underneath the rear cover. Hence there's not much going on here, other than the power button and volume rocker on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is similarly minimalist - nothing but a primary mic can be found there, as Lenovo likes to put the microUSB port on top on its budget models. The 3.5mm jack is on top, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5-incher is always going to be easier to handle than phablets and the Vibe K5 is one of the former. The gentle curves on the back do add a bit of comfort, but it's still quite slippery thanks to the fine satin finish on the back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5-inch display with 720p resolution - can't complain<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 relies on a 5-inch 720p IPS display. The resolution is one of the few downgrades, compared to the Plus. Or rather the Vibe K5, being the base model, gets the base resolution. At 294ppi, pixel density is still good enough, even if we have to add "considering the price" once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No surprises when we put it under the microscope - the Vibe K5's panel has a standard RGB layout with an equal number of subpixels for each primary color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5's display is capable of more than 400nits of brightness in its default mode, which isn't spectacular - more like average. Its black levels aren't too good either, and that somewhat ruins contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color reproduction is reasonably accurate in default mode, with an average DeltaE of 6.1. You can adjust the colors in settings and achieve an average DeltaE of 3, but at the expense of maximum brightness, which drops by about 100nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the sunlight legibility test the Vibe K5 posted virtually the same score as the Plus. The dispay being one of the few parts not shared between the two, we thought this might be an area where they performed differently. Well, they didn't and the Vibe K5 scored a good figure for an LCD - not iPhone-6s-good, but better than the HTC 10, for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 is a dual-SIM smartphone and it takes microSIMs in both slots. Both are 2G-capable, but only one gets the 3G/4G treatment. LTE is Cat. 4 for theoretical transfer speeds of 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up. It has a dedicated microSD slot - so no dilemmas between extra storage and a second SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get single-band 2.4GHz Wi-Fi b/g/n (no ac) with hotspot support, GPS with A-GPS, Bluetooth v4.1, and an FM radio receiver. There's no NFC or an infrared port, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port is USB OTG enabled, and you also get a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 packs a 2,750mAh battery - the same as the K5 Plus. A different (supposedly more frugal) chipset and display resolution sound like the right way improve battery performance but this isn't the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 posted largely the same numbers as the K5 Plus, and while that is more of a testament to the Plus for squeezing the same endurance with higher-grade hardware, this plain K5 is by no means inadequately powered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Close to 9 hours on the web over Wi-Fi, and 8 hours of video playback are average numbers, and actually pretty good for the battery capacity. The 3G talk time isn't great, at 13 hours, and that's where the K5 Plus lasts a little longer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 runs on a heavily customized Android 5.1. It's named Vibe OS, but you won't find that advertised throughout the interface like other makers do. The overlay isn't too consistent, and there are hints of Material design here and there, mixed up with remnants of older concepts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a rather standard affair. The default layout consists of a clock widget with a date, followed by a list of notifications. You also get shortcuts for quick access to the dialer and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical fashion for a droid coming out of China, there's no app drawer - all your apps reside on the homescreens. New ones can be added with ease, existing ones can be rearranged and any homescreen tab can be set as default home. Screen transition effects can be selected, and you can choose whether to be able to cycle back to the first one after reaching the end or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a wide selection of themes available too, complete with icon packs, and these can change the vibe of the Vibe K5 completely. Some of them look better than others with non-system icons - the more customized the theme, the more out of place Google Chrome looks, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive keys below the display are Recent tasks/Home/Back, left to right. The recent tasks one doubles as a context menu button and that's a bit odd in truly Material design apps, which have the three-dot menu in the top right. Making things even less intuitive, the context menu and the three-dot menu often contain different options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the ambiguous nature of the left capacitive key, getting to the recent tasks requires a long press, instead of a tap. Naturally, that adds an extra bit of waiting to an action you'd be doing constantly. There's a "Clear all" button, in the diagonally opposite top right corner, so you'd be stretching your thumbs a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there's a task manager that gives you more detailed information on what resources each app is using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification shade works in two stages. Pull down once with one finger, and you get notifications only, pull down a second time and you get the entire list of quick toggles, with notifications squished below. There's no priority row of toggles that gets opened on the first pull, it's none or all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A chief difference between the Vibe K5 and the K5 Plus is the chipset. Whereas the Plus relies on the Snapdragon 616, the K5 gets a 400 series chip, the Snapdragon 415. Unlike the 410, however, the 415 incorporates an octa-core CPU with four Cortex-A53 cores that go up to 1.4GHz, and another four capped at 1.0GHz. So in effect, the 415 sits closer to the 616, than it does to the 410 with its quad-core CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not just the processor, the GPU is the same Adreno 405 as in the K5 Plus' Snapdragon 616. Both SoC's are manufactured on a 28nm process too. Additionally, the Vibe K5 comes with 2GB of RAM, just like its Plus sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this considered, we didn't expect significant differences in benchmark performance, certainly not to the extent suggested by the 600 vs. 400 family difference. If anything, the lower resolution of the K5 coupled with otherwise similar hardware might actually mean better scores, we thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it doesn't, not for the most part. In GeekBench, where raw CPU performance is measured, the K5 is only some 11% behind the K5 Plus in single-core tests, though the difference becomes more pronounced in multi-core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-core budget Galaxies and the Xperia E5 are no match for the K5, not in single-core and certainly not in multi-core tests. Then again, 600-series Snapdragons found in the Moto G4 and Oppo F1, for example, are noticeably more powerful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall performance is examined in Basemark II 2.0, and the Vibe K5 does a reasonably good job. Again quad-core entry-level devices are far behind, but the K5 is the lowest-ranked of the octa-cores. The Snapdragon 616-equipped Redmi 3 isn't much better though, and neither is the Helio P10 in the m3 note. The Oppo F1 makes better use of its S616, in this test at least, and the Xperia XA proves the P10 is capable of a lot more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Antutu comes next, in current and older flavors. In the latest pre-6 release, the Vibe K5 scores about 35K points, inching ahead of its Plus brother. Order is restored in Antutu 6, where the Plus regains the lead over the plain K5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to graphics performance, you can easily tell that the Adreno 405 is much happier pushing 720p than FullHD, just by a quick glance at GFXBench numbers. In the offscreen test the the K5 lags behind the K5 Plus (lower clock rate possibly to blame), but pulls ahead in the onscreen part, rendered at the devices' respective actual resolutions. That said, the Oppo F1 and Xiaomi Redmi 3 still manage a couple of fps more than the K5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark X levels the field to 1080p rendering and the K5 is again slightly behind the Plus, but the Redmi 3 and the Oppo F1 speak louder for team Snapdragon 616.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all in all, the Vibe K5 is marginally slower than the K5 Plus, with the exception of 3D gaming, where it can do twice as many fps as its slightly more expensive FullHD bro owing to the having a lowe screen resolution but the same GPU. Snapdragon 616 devices outperform the K5 in general, but the difference isn't as substantial as the difference we saw between last year's S615 vs. S410, and the K5 is certainly not lacking in oomph, especially given its price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Custom phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 has a fully custom phonebook. It is laid out across four tabs: dialer, call log, contacts, and favorites. There's smart dial support, as well as speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts is self explanatory - you get an alphabetized list of them, which you can search or filter them by first letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 is a dual SIM device (both micro SIMs) and as such has settings for SIM handling. Each card can be assigned a name and a number, and cards can be disabled from the menu, so you don't have to physically remove them, if for some reason you don't want to use one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can select default cards to use for voice calls, messaging and data, or have the phone ask you each time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 scored a Good rating in our loudspeaker test, which is a bit odd given that its Plus sibling managed a notch higher. Presumably the hardware is the same - two speakers, in stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you look at the numbers though, they are only a decibel or two lower in each individual test, but it adds up to a different overall rating in the end. It's still pretty loud, and louder than major competitors, so there's nothing to worry about in this department.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 employs the stock Android keyboard. It doesn't have a dedicated number row, but numbers do come out upon a long press. You can choose between a number of color themes or even pick a photo of your own for background.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 uses a non-customized AOSP gallery. You're greeted with a grid view of your albums, and you can easily create a new one. Inside the album the images are displayed two-a-row, and no pinch gesture is going to change that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor, on the other hand, is a bit more powerful. It offers the obvious cropping, rotation and mirroring, color filters and picture frames, but also more serious editing like curves adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player, the task is handled from within the gallery. There's little in the way of features other than looping the video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is a similarly barebone app. It has the usual tabs for artists, songs and playlists and can pull album art and subtitles off the internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 comes with Dolby Atmos certified audio enhancements. They're accessed from the settings menu where the Dolby Atmos screen holds the equalizer and other settings. You can change different modes (Movie, Music, Game, Voice, Custom), each getting its own 5-band equalizer setting. Additionally, you have things like surround virtualizer, dialogue enhancer and volume leveler.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe K5 comes with an FM radio receiver. It lacks RDS so you'll need to enter station names manually. You can assign favorites and record off the radio, and you can play through the loudspeaker, but you need to have the headset plugged in so serve as the antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio is a little quiet, nicely clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 isn?t the loudest smartphone we?ve subjected to our audio quality test, but it sounds as clear as most phones when used with an active external amplifier. And the below average volume certainly isn?t too hard to swallow given the low price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headphones test went very well too - there was a pronounced stereo crosstalk hike, but the other readings remained unchanged so, once again, it performs better than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Okay 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 features a 13MP camera with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels in its native 4:3 mode. The lens has an f/2.2 aperture. A single-LED flash is present but there are no niceties in the line of OIS and phase detection/laser autofocus - not that you'd expect them at the price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the camera app is logically laid out. On the top left you get four shortcuts (front/rear camera switch, flash mode selector, HDR toggle and shutter release mode). The settings menu is accessed via a dedicated shortcut in the bottom left corner, which brings up a tabbed interface with tabs for stills, video and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has provided the basic shooting modes - there's Normal, Panorama and Effects. While other makers give you a Pro/Manual mode, here you can just go about and tinker with some of the variables from the settings menu. You get white balance presets and manual ISO selection, but also access to image properties - sharpness, saturation, the lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera output of the Lenovo Vibe K5 exhibits qualities you'd expect to find in this segment. In bright daylight it captures average to good detail, yet its images are a little too soft. Intricate high frequency details like distant foliage are not its forte. Noise is also guaranteed to be found in the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't find the colors as punchy as on K5 Plus, but we figure that's due to the 4 months between the reviews making a difference in weather and lighting. Saturation is one of the picture controls that can be adjusted in settings anyway, so you can influence that with the touch of a slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone consistently exposes well, there are no pronounced tendencies to err on either side. Dynamic range isn't among the K5's greatest strengths - shadows often end up pitch black when shooting scenes with bright light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode on the Vibe K5 does what it's meant to - brightens up the shadows and tones down the highlights. On occasion it produces over-the-top results (the outdoor image pair below a prime example), in other scenes the effect is more natural. HDR shots are a touch softer than regular photos, but overall detail is preserved. Oddly, the FOV gets a tiny bit narrower in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode on the Vibe K5 appears to be based on video capture, and produces very low-res results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at how the Lenovo K5 stacks up against the competition in our Photo Compare Tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 is equipped with a 5MP front-facing camera, mated to a rather dim by today's standards f/2.8 lens. It creates detailed images, and its limited dynamic range is par for the course, so overall it's a decent selfie shooter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>FullHD at 30fps is the best the Vibe K5 can offer in video recording, but that's hardly grounds for complaint in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded with a bit rate of 20Mbps with a stereo audio stream at 96Kbps. The captured detail is about average, it's certainly not impressive, but we've seen worse. Perhaps the most annoying bit about the K5's video recording is the persistent focus hunting, which you can observe no less than 4 times in the 30-second video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p video sample (12s, 30MB) taken straight from the Lenovo vibe K5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out our Video Compare Tool to see how the Lenovo Vibe K5 fares against the competition when it comes to video capturing.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A couple of browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 comes with two browsers pre-installed - UC Browser and Google Chrome. Chrome you know and love for its integration with your Google account among other things, but UC Browser isn't as ubiquitous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The squirrel-branded alternative is designed to be fast and light but has the bases duly covered with a data-saving feature, night and incognito modes, and a built-in adblocker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pre-installed, you'll find the Route 66 navigation app, or at least a free 30-day trial for voice-guided navigation. Considering a license is &#x20ac;30, you'd probably stick with Google/Bing Maps or similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Companion is a mobile trouble-shooter. You can search for walkthroughs for your device (in written or video form), you can check for firmware updates (with data back up included) and diagnosing all the hardware of the phone (e.g. testing the vibration or the loudspeaker).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File browser makes it easy to find files of a specific type (e.g. documents or photos), it will even handle ZIPs. Of course, you can browse the full folder structure of both the internal storage and the microSD. It supports mass actions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature lets you wirelessly manage your files through your computer browser (as long as both the computer and phone are connected to the same network). This functionality is based on SwiFTP, which is available on the Play Store as FTP Server. It's better to use a proper FTP app, though, your browser offers only limited functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SYNCit allows you to backup Contacts, SMS and Call log to the Lenovo cloud. If you don't want to set up an account, you can backup to the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a trial version of McAfee LiveSafe, which can scan for viruses, protect your personal info, and help you recover your device in case you lose it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a built-in compass app, so you don't have to deal with ad-supported alternatives from the Play Store, the calculator has a scientific mode in portrait (and knows proper order of operations), and the sound recorder can save in .amr, .3gpp, and .wav formats.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe K5 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Generic, no-frills design with a metal back to add a touch of premium</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display doesn't excel in any test, but doesn't fail any of them either. Average maximum brightness and contrast, decently accurate color reproduction in default mode, which can be made even better by tweaking the settings (at the expense of brightness, though)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery endurance rating of 64 hours, average numbers across the board. We appreciate the fact that the battery is user-replaceable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 415 may be a 400-series member, but thanks to its similar octa-core CPU and same GPU it's only slightly behind 61x models. 720p resolution helps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Lollipop on the K5 seems unlikely to get a bump to Marshmallow - such is the fate of most budget models. The custom overlay isn't perfect, but after a period of adjustment you can get used to its quirks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo loudspeakers are loud, the Good rating is oddly a notch down from the K5 Plus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detailed, if a little noisy, images from the 13MP primary camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5MP selfie camera captures good detail too, you can look past the almost universally clipped highlights</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise decent 1080p video is marred by persistent focus-hunting</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If this entire review sounded familiar to you, there's a good reason. The Lenovo Vibe K5 is very much the same phone as the Vibe K5 Plus we've already seen. And that's a good thing, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It means a removable battery, two SIM compartments and another dedicated microSD slot, all of those underneath a removable metal back cover. A pair of booming stereo speakers is another area where the K5 delivers above its pay grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K5 is about as dependable a photographic tool as you could expect for the money - good output when the light is right, less so in dim scenes. Video hasn't been fixed from when we reviewed the K5 Plus and its erratic focusing renders it unusable at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key differences are mostly in principle, rather than experience, and start with the display, where the vanilla Vibe K5 makes do with 720p resolution. Pixel density aside, the panel is equally good, posting reasonable scores in all tests without deal-breaking weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is quite respectable too, though the lower resolution hasn't given the K5 much of an edge over the Plus. Performance isn't an issue either, despite what you might have thought when you see a Snapdragon 400-series chipset - the 415 is closer to the 615s of this world than it is to the 410.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth noting that the Lenovo Vibe K5 ranges from a reasonably priced offering to a straight-up steal. In Europe it's priced in the ballpark of ?170, while in India, for example, it carries a much lower price tag, equivalent to ?95 (for comparison's sake). And since it's a value for money proposition, it's a lot easier to recommend at that latter price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not without its rivals though. There's obviously the Vibe K5 Plus on top of that list, and that's a dilemma that may be solved for you by availability - the two aren't necessarily available in all markets together. If you do have to choose, it's rather a philosophical question - the FullHD resolution of the Plus is nice, but if you can live with 720p, why not save that money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a whole bunch of Xiaomi Redmi 3's, that are on the same shelf as the Vibe K5. Perhaps the closest competitor though is the Redmi 3s. Its Snapdragon 430 has a similar CPU, but a better GPU, the Redmi has Marshmallow and a notably larger 4,100mAh battery. Those in favor of removable batteries may still opt for the Vibe K5, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has the hugely popular Galaxy J2 (2016) in this segment, but that one only brings half of the K5's storage and 1.5GB of RAM, plus an inferior chipset. It boots Marshmallow, on the other hand, and it's got that Smart glow on the back, which may come in handy for those of you who are okay with resting their phone face down on a table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shopping around for affordable 5-inchers is sure to bring you to the Meizu m2, or for a little more cash - the m3. The m2 has a weaker chipset, with only a quad-core CPU, so you should probably consider the m3 as the more futureproof device, especially if you opt for the pricier 3GB/32GB version. That's if Meizu sells in your region at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No Meizus in Europe, but the K5's price there makes the Xperia E5 a viable option, though still slightly costlier. The E5 does get you Marshmallow, but has half a gig less of RAM, and somewhat worse battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not every day you see an entry-level smartphone that does a decent job all round and we had a deja-vu moment with the Lenovo Vibe K5, after its Plus brother left a very positive impression a few months ago. This one even outranks it on the value-for-money meter, and the trade-offs don't make it any worse. Just more affordable. Sounds like a fair deal then.</paragraph>
