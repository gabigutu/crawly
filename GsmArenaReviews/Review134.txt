			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari may miss the mark as the most innovative slider, but only if you don't look closer. Upon a second look, you will find that the Sony Ericsson Yari is a tiny little thing that's full of surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yari has got a pretty decent 5 megapixel auto focus camera, but it's main focus point is another thing - gesture gaming. And we're not talking about accelerometer-based gesture recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to an optical tracker technology developed by GestureTek, the Sony Ericsson Yari can use its camera to detect your movements and translate them into games moves. It can even do wireless multiplayer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The technology has already been available to Japanese DoCoMo cellphones but it's only now that it's making its way to world-wide availability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Yari at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari also has a built-in GPS receiver to deliver location-based services as accurately as they come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Wi-Fi support is not present on our Yari test unit despite the numerous videos presenting that in YouTube and such. As Sony Ericsson are not advertising the feature, we guess the retail unit won't be Wi-Fi capable as well. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Yari sports a neat and simple design that will probably seem attractive to more conservative users. However under the unassuming hood lay some pretty extraordinary features that might attract tech-freaks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters there are two small knobs above the display, which are actually gaming keys. Those are a bit small but putting larger ones there will probably have devastating effect on the phone's design. Between the keys in question are the light sensor, the secondary camera and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below them is the 2.4" 262K color display which has pretty good picture quality although we have seen Sony Ericsson do better on several occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, an ample D-pad is sided by six controls. Each is topped by a thin soft key, followed by pretty large Call (left) and End key (right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom knobs are Shortcuts on the left and Clear key on the right. The styling of the navigation pad is quite elegant and the controls are adequately usable even though larger-handed people might have some issues getting used to the soft keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad up direction also acts as a shortcut to the music player when on the homescreen, hence the music player icon on top of it. The other sides of the control are also assigned various shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the decent 12-key alphanumeric keypad. It is utterly flat offering little tangible borders between the different rows or columns. Those that like texting on the go will hardly appreciate the fact that you have to look at most times to avoid typos but in most other cases it does the job.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson Yari features nothing but the regular Fast Port as it seems that our prayers for a standard 3.5mm + micro/miniUSB combination aren't answered yet again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the elevated volume rocker and the two-position camera key. Here you can also find the microSD (now that is some good news right?) card slot, hidden under a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and the top are pretty simple with the lanyard eyelet all there is to see there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backstage Sony Ericsson Yari we find the 5 megapixel camera, accompanied by a LED flash. Here are also the dual loudspeaker grills, either side of the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1000 mAh Li-Po battery. It is quoted at hours of stand-by and hours of talk time but as you might have guessed we won't be able to comment on those numbers in the preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Sony Ericsson Yari seems pretty decent although considering the early stages of its development even the materials used might change.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The familiar "Flash" interface in new clothes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari user interface is almost the same as in the latest manufacturer's phones we recently reviewed. It is customizable by Flash Lite themes and is sprinkled with smooth animations all over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface offers many options and settings accessible at great speed - adding to an uncompromising user experience. In fact the latest Sony Ericsson UI is one of the prettiest and most customizable one among the feature phone competition. And now it has been tuned even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with some minor changes such as the absence of a tabbed Settings menu (it's a regular listed one now), there is more interesting stuff such as the addition of Picasa and Flickr integration (along with Blogger) that allows direct image and video uploading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the PhotoMap application that can show your geotagged images directly on the map downloaded off Google Maps - and the whole thing is tightly integrated into the Image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty is Quick text. Quick text is an optional feature that works in addition to T9. It recognizes the most frequently used words for each sequence of key presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are of course more new things, so read on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unified media control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media menu seems to be an integral part of all recent Sony Ericsson phones and the Yari makes no difference to the rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the Sony Ericsson Yari comes with the latest Walkman music player without being a dedicated Walkman device. That's a move, which is quite in tune with what Sony Ericsson promised back in February as part of their communication-and-entertainment-all-in-one strategy. The same thing goes for the 5 megapixel camera as well (how's that for a non-Cyber-shot?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player controls will be quite familiar to those who ever used some of the Walkmans in the past few years. The options are almost the same - stereo widening, equalizers are all on board. Automatic screen rotation thanks to the built-in accelerometer is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's new here however is the option to change styles. Those goodies come with Walkman 3.0 and are supposedly present in Sony Ericsson W995, but our test sample a few months ago lacked those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we are pleasantly surprised by the new visualization styles that the Yari sports - they are completely different from each other and use many Flash animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may opt for a spinning vinyl with some fancy buttons around it, or an old gramophone, a tape-recorder, or even a home stereo system (much more are available as well). Every one of these styles gives the player look and feel a total overhaul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the Media menu is the familiar gallery and video player. The image gallery has some new transition effects which add more eye-candy to the already nice interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a pre-release unit the Sony Ericsson Yari camera did pretty nice job. Occasionally, that is, as image quality varied in each camera sample we took. Here's one that turned out nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has no changes since the W995 or the W595/W902 - easy to use as usual. Face detection, Smile shot and geotagging are all on board (without BestPic shooting mode though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording on the Yari unfortunately is still limited to QVGA@30fps. We bet Sony Ericsson have seen enough criticism over this one, so we'll just jump to the next chapter. Some things never change we guess.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing and location services on the go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the Sony Ericsson Yari is equipped with a GPS receiver and the usual Location services set is pre-installed. You will find both Google Maps and Wayfinder Navigator on board. Other applications such as Tracker make good use of the GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser preinstalled on the Yari is latest NetFront 3.5 web browser. It offers a much smoother experience and renders web pages more quickly. Almost every time it nails the zoom level for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with the well-known mouse pointer, the new NetFront 3.5 web browser always operates in fullscreen view mode and the four most important features are easily accessible on a toolbar - mini-map, enter an address, favorites and downloads. Additionally we spotted some other new features as well such as mark-and-copy, which allows you to copy text off web pages and the added Flash support (which unfortunately doens't really relate to Flash video watching).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera-based motion gaming is here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yes, we did not misplace the word "motion". If you ever played some sport games on the Nintendo Wii console you'll be in friendly terms with the gaming system of Yari.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to an optical tracker technology developed by GestureTek, the Sony Ericsson Yari can use its camera to detect your movements in the compatible games and translate them into virtual ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The technology has already been available to Japanese DoCoMo cellphones but it's only now that it's making its way to world-wide availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two gesture-controlled games - Tennis and Fitness. All of them are very easy to play - you put the phone on your desk (preferably upright), you take a place in front of it and imagine you have a racket in hand. Then play on!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera captures almost every movement right and the games can be quite a fun - especially having in mind that it's a mobile phone you're playing on. It can even be more fun if there are people around you while you gesticulate wildly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of people around you, Sony Ericsson promise wireless multiplayer on those gesture-based games, so we guess even more phones will be coming out with that functionality. Let's just hope that at least those new "gaming" phones will be easier to place on a desk in an upright position.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So there you have it - while the Sony Ericsson Yari isn't a revolutionary device, Sony Ericsson have just successfully revolutionized their portfolio. You've got a top-notch music player, high-res camera with Face and Smile detection, GPS receiver, a praise-worthy web browser and the latest in Sony Ericsson UI development all in one device. Not to mention the extraordinary gesture-based gaming. The newly adopted and much welcomed transition to microSD cards support is also something to cheer about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, VGA-or-better video recording is still not part of the deal. We've also hoped for a bigger screen, but for those that have thought of these same things - you are welcome to our Sony Ericsson Aino preview that's due in a little while.</paragraph>
