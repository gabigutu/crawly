		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has been slowly, but steadily making a name for itself for selling affordable, well-made phones throughout the entire price range. This year's Idol X+ is their flagship and it's an affordable yet robust product. With an octa-core processor of Mediatek's MT6592 variety, the X+ is able to throttle as many processor cores as it needs, to balance performance and battery efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol X+ sports the same 5-inch fullHD display of its predecessor, the Idol X, and puts on an extra 500mAh of battery capacity - and dual-SIM support - while adding just 1mm to its thickness. The LCD panel is so close to the surface it's as if there's no glass between your fingers and the interface. It also features a minimal amount of side bezels, both facts lending to the premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But not all of the changes are for the better. To make room for the extra SIM slot, the Idol X+ has lost the microSD card support of its predecessor, and it runs the same aging Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick breakdown of the key features and disadvantages of Alcatel's new flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until now Alcatel's strategy for keeping costs down revolved around low internal memory, which was compensated for by the microSD card. With no card slot and only 16GB storage on board of our review unit, things are obviously a bit different this time around, and we're curious how the 32GB version will be priced and whether it will be as competitive as the other products in the company's portfolio. That said, the Idol X+ is a package that will certainly ring a bell if you didn't miss our review of the Alcatel Hero phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But pricing is something we'll get to in due time. For now, let's get things under way with our in-depth hardware examination.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Idol X+ 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ measures 140.4 x 69.1 x 7.9mm, which is just 1.6mm taller and 1mm wider than the Idol X, while managing to retain the same weight despite the larger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slim screen bezels also help the device remain manageable while offering plenty of screen real estate. You can use the device comfortably in one hand thanks to its 130g of weight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with the Idol X, Alcatel has taken design cues from numerous devices when it comes to the X+. The front nods at Google's Nexus 5, while the speaker grilles at the bottom look like a page out of Apple's book. The texture of the battery cover is reminiscent of the ASUS Zenbooks. Either way, the end result isn't bad and similarities to other devices should be taken as a compliment rather than a dig at the Idol X+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimal gap between the LCD panel and the front glass results brings the image on the screen as close to your fingers as possible. Also, the slim side screen bezels make one-handed operation even easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy back panel is not our favorite feature. The attractive underlying texture aside, it is very prone to fingerprints and has a surface that many manufacturers have moved away from in recent years for exactly that reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive keys below the display provide a nice contrast to the all-black front panel, while the physical power/lock and volume rocker buttons have good resistance and are solidly built.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Idol X+, Alcatel has also outed a fitness band called BoomBand aimed at capitalizing on the emerging trend of smart wearables that complement smartphones. By default, the band tracks your steps walked, telling you distance and calories burned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>More advanced features include fitness goals, sleep tracking, alarms, anti-loss alerts, and incoming call notifications. Alcatel rates it for a maximum standby of 3-5 days. It's paired using the onboard BoomBand Life app, which we cover in more detail in the apps section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Idol X+ sports a bright white status LED to the left of the earpiece for notifications and such, alongside an assortment of sensors and the 2MP 1080p front-facer on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On either side of the device are the two SIM card compartments, the volume rocker placed right below the one on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One nice geeky touch is that the SIM slots have magnetically locked covers. But we can't help but raise our proverbial eyebrow at this solution. Being made out of metal, the covers have a slightly different finish than the otherwise plastic rim that runs around the phone so they stand out and not in the good way. Secondly, they easily detach and fall off when the back cover is removed. It's true, there aren't a lot of reasons to open the back panel in the first place as the battery is not removable, but still, these present a certain liability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side has a 3.5mm audio jack and power/lock button, while the bottom side features the microUSB port, and a pair of iPhone-esque microphone grilles on either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the main attraction is the 13MP camera lens accompanied by an LED flash and a microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear panel is made of slick glossy plastic that's very prone to fingerprints and it's also quite easy to scratch (so grab yourself some protection). The back panel would certainly look good on press shots - there's an underlying pattern that looks different depending how the light hit it, but as soon as you start using the phone, it turns into a smudgy mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panel can be removed without the need for special tools, although doing so means the SIM card covers will fall off their hinges. So make sure you don't lose them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strange fact, the removable cover serves no real purpose - the 2,500mAh battery isn't user replaceable and there is no slot of any sort hidden under.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ features a 5" IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution, for a pixel density of 441ppi. It has an oleophobic film to minimize smudges and Gorilla Glass 2 for scratch protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is quite sharp and with good viewing angles despite some minor contrast shift when not looked head on. The colors are not the punchiest we've seen, but many people rail against the oversaturated look of AMOLEDs so this might be more to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OGS panel did not do much to improve or detract from the contrast ratio compared to a standard IPS display. It provided middle-of-the-road numbers when it came to contrast at both 50% and 100% screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does, however, result in some excellent sunlight legibility, coming in fifth in our all-time rankings, just behind the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery test on the Alcatel Idol X+ and the results turned out good. The Alcatel Idol X+ pulled an overall rating of 45h hours. That's how long it will last on a single charge with an hour each of calling, browsing and watching video daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It did pretty well in all tasks that didn't require the screen to be on, such as talking and standby power consumption. In web browsing and video playbackthe results were far from stellar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with some custom Alcatel touches. The most notable are the two special homescreens - one that can be scrolled vertically, the other that shows off your gallery pictures in a rotating tile-like view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video demo that shows the basics of the interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color scheme and the icons have changed compared to stock Android, but for the most part things are where you'd expect them to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous versions of Alcatel's launcher, there was support for lockscreen widgets. The default lockscreen on the Idol X+, however, still shows weather and event notifications, but doesn't let you interact with them as before. Instead, you swipe right to get to the homescreen, and left to quickly access the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also face, pattern, pin, and even voice unlock, or you can disable the lockscreen altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the homescreen, moving between panes is done with left and right swipes, although they do not loop like on most UIs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unique to the Idol X+ are two special homescreens located on the very left of the series. One of them is like a regular homescreen except it can be scrolled vertically as well, while the other displays a tiled view of images from your gallery, which rotate based on customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zooming gives you an overview of all your homescreen panes, where you can disable one or both of the special homescreens. To increase the number of homescreens, you have to add a widget or shortcut to the blank homescreen pane that's only visible from the widget menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget menu is accessed by holding down on a blank area of a homescreen, and then dragging widgets to the individual homescreens in the resulting interface. There doesn't seem to be a limit on how many you can place on the special vertically scrollable homescreen. Alcatel's custom widgets - clock, calendar, weather, music player - are not resizable, but the default Google ones are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across two tabs - all apps and downloaded apps - and the grid can be filtered by name or by installation date. The app switcher is equally as simple, accessed from anywhere by holding down the contextual button. You swipe up apps to remove them and there is a 'clear all' button, but more than half of the screen remains unused - an odd design choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is almost stock Android, and is accessed by dragging down from the top of the screen. Notifications can be dismissed via left or right swipes, and expandable ones can be resized via two-finger vertical swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also access quick settings toggles with the shortcut in the upper right - a screen that will display directly if there are no notifications. Holding down on a toggle will take you directly to the relevant menu in settings. Accessing the notification are with a two finger swipe will open up the toggles directly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also control which third party apps get to show icons in the top left of the notification bar, which is great for annoying apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has added further improvements to stock Android, including some basic gestures: flipping over the phone to silence an incoming call or snooze an alarm, and shaking the device to skip a song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now, accessed by holding down the home button, lets you use voice commands and integrates with your Google account to provide all sorts of information from internet searches to your daily routine, localized traffic, and current weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can also perform organizational activities like directions to locations you've recently searched, or reminders.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ is powered by an octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A7 Mediatek MT6592 chipset - the first device we've reviewed capable of running on eight cores simultaneously. Unlike previous octa-core configurations that ran one set of quad-core chips or another, the Idol X+ is able to throttle any number of cores to work depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to graphics, you get a Mali-450MP4 GPU clocked at 700 MHz, alongside 2GB of RAM. We're very eager to see how Mediatek's chip stacks up to current flagship competition, not to mention how the robust Mali GPU fares in our graphics benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get things started with a couple of processor-only benchmarks, where the 2.0 GHz processor surprisingly underperforms when it comes to the single-core BenchmarkPi test. Linpack also shows a surprisingly low result despite bringing multiple cores into the mix, but that could be attributed to a dated algorithm, as Geekbench 3 puts it right among the top devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu are compound benchmarks which take into account RAM and GPU performance, also give the Idol X+ a commendable score, although not up to par with the latest Snapdragon 801-toting flagships.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our graphics benchmarks were a mixed bag. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some very poor performance, while Epic Citadel ran incredibly well, giving the Adreno graphics chips in the top rated competitors like the Galaxy S5 a real run for their money.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is an integral part to any smartphone experience, and the Idol X+ posts respectable, if not remarkable, results in both of our browser benchmarks. The quality of the display provides for a pleasant browsing experience that somewhat makes up for the mediocre scores reflected here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to get a bead on overall benchmark performance because the individual benchmarks varied so much. It could be that many benchmarks were not optimized to take into account "true" octa-core results, or the processor itself was adjusting its core usage during certain benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Extraneous results aside, the Idol X+ falls respectably into a segment that's towards the top of the pack, but a step behind the cutting-edge Snapdragon 801 flagships.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Idol X+ looks pretty basic - a list of all contacts complete with photos. An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if a contact comes from one of the two SIM cards rather than an online service (Google, Facebook, etc.), a SIM icon showing which card it's from will appear on its contact photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can assign a plethora of contact information including custom ringtones and images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ has support for two SIM cards, both of which are hot-swappable, which is a great feature to have if you switch SIMs out a lot. Another neat feature is the ability to tie a particular contact to always get dialed from a particular card, letting you set a number on a particular network and not worry about it again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works great if someone has multiple numbers too - say two phones on two different carriers. This feature is invaluable and will save you a lot of manual switching between SIMs and wondering which one you should be using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice-looking dialer is also functional, including smart searching, video calling, and even IP dial by default. The latter feature lets you place calls directly over the voice over IP protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM management tool is accessed from the Settings menu, and allows you to toggle a SIM on or off individually (good if you need the second line only part-time). Assigning the individual SIMs to specific tasks (one for calls and one for data, for example), assigning numbers, and customizing SIM names and colors are all done from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol X+ loudspeaker markedly fails to impress in our loudness test, and posts a score of Below Average. Here's how it stacks up to some of its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app holds no surprises - messages are organized into threads, each thread showing the contact photo and two lines of text from the latest message. A small logo on the bottom of each bubble shows which SIM card sent/received the message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to an MMS by pressing the plus sign to the left of the text field. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like generates a more elaborate message editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. It's not multi-SIM aware though, so you lose some of the finer controls of the Alcatel app but you can still rely on the bindings between contacts and SIMs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to GMail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimal screen gap on the Idol X+ means that touch input is a breeze, and the SwiftKey integration gives you a lot of ways to do it. You get undocked, split, or one-handed keyboard types, as well as the ability to resize the keys to your liking and even customize with current keys. Of course, SwiftKey also provides swipe input for quicker typing, and Google's voice dictation with offline language packs is also here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Custom gallery can create custom collages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Default view of the gallery is Albums, the first of which is always the Camera album, which has a camera overlay icon too. Unfortunately, there's no support for online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. An alternative to the grid view is filmstrip view, which is more suitable for landscape viewing as it shows bigger thumbnails. A nice feature here is that thumbnails for video files are animated, although it takes a while for them to get started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a built-in editor that covers the basics - cropping, rotation and flipping, sharpening - but you can get into the more advanced stuff too, like beauty tools (e.g. change skin complexion), image controls, effects, frames, text labels and bokeh effects for simulating depth of field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app also features a collage tool that can combine up to 9 photos, with a variety of preset collage arrangements and borders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Movie Studio is also on board so you can edit videos as well as photos. To make a video, just create a new project, add videos or photos to the timeline, add music too. Videos can be trimmed if they run too long and you can add text titles, transitions and effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has no subtitle support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface - sans the animated thumbnails from the gallery. You can adjust how the video fits on the screen, but there is no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support is reasonably good, supporting all major codecs including MOV files - a bit of a rarity with Android devices. The audio codec support was no match however, and there was no sound on videos that use AC3, Dolby Digital or DTS (which are the codecs of choice for multichannel audio).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share videos wirelessly with Wi-Fi Direct right from the video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the video player was a bit of a letdown, the music player makes up for it with a full list of features. It has a tabbed interface that sorts music by artist, album, lists all songs or shows the playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is custom and shows a giant vinyl record when there's no album art available. There are basic features like scrubbing through a song, activating repeat and shuffle (including Part shuffle that just mixes your whole library).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a capable equalizer that lets you make adjustments, although some require a plugged-in headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you're playing a song, the lockscreen will display a full-frame shot of the album art alongside simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM Radio is a pretty straightforward affair. You need to plug in a pair of headphones (to act as an antenna), the app will start playing. Sound can be played through the headset or the loudspeaker. RDS is available and you can even record broadcasts (this feature might not be universally available).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch Idol X+'s audio quality is a tale of two chapters. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone delivers impressively loud audio with good frequency response, excellent dynamic range and no distortion. Certainly one of the best performance in this scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, just like with the One Touch Hero before it, the Idol X+ lost quite a lot of its brilliance when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Volume levels dropped quite a lot - from excellent to average, while stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion spiked. Less demanding users might be fine with this performance, but audiophiles should take their business elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A nice 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ sports a 13MP camera on the back and a 2MP front-facer. The main cam has an LED flash to help along in low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is a custom job but it's pretty straightforward. Two columns trim the viewfinder: one for settings on the left and one for the virtual shutter on the right. You can also use the volume rocker to snap photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash is not really strong and even though flash photos come out looking quite naturally lit, the setting of the flash resembles more that of a fill light rather than that of a flash, which serves as a main source of light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ produced some nice looking photos. At 100% magnification, there seems to be a lot of luminance noise even in daytime shots but the overall level of resolved detail is pleasing. The level of luminance noise steadily increases as light gets low but resolved detail remains satisfactory even in darker settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At times, the camera struggled with the exposure in high contrast light conditions. One time it would be alright, then another time it would either capture the scene too bright or too dark and even using touch focus didn't help much. Quite frequently we had to use touch focus on an unrelated subject on in the scene just so the camera reads its tonal characteristics and provides a more balanced overall exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To take care of high contrast light conditions there is of course, a built-in HDR shooting mode. The results however are underwhelming. Indeed, the otherwise dark shadow open up quite a bit, but the highlights often end up blown out instead of being preserved. To make matters worse, the camera applies a heavy dosage of sharpening creating visible sharpening halos around subjects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly though, in HDR mode, the camera produces not one, but two photos. The second one is closer to the photos that the camera would produce normally, but this one has the contrast dialed down (in a good way). More often than not we found that image to be a better pick than the normal photo or the HDR photo. So getting these images alone made it worthwhile to use the HDR mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo Quality Comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ has plenty of smartphones to contend with in our Photo compare tool, which lets you see just how it fares against other 13MP shooters.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera hurt by outdated format<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder is just a click on the mode toggle away. The 13MP camera can do 1080p video (called Superfine), while the front camera tops out at 720p (that one is called Fine - Alcatel obviously has a thing for naming resolution modes). The main camera can use the LED flash as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ records videos in 3GP, which we hadn't seen in quite a while. It records video at 17Mbps and stereo audio at 129Kbps, but the 3GP codec is fairly dated and isn't the optimal format for fullHD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ videos are not as good as the still camera results suggest. They come out smooth but lack the level of detail that we are used to see from flagship cameraphones. Still, they are not a letdown by all means and can serve their purpose just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample so you can judge the video quality for yourself:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ has quad-band GSM and dual-band 3G connectivity for both SIM cards. There's no LTE antenna onboard, as it's not supported by the MT6592 chipset. Its 3G is DC-HSPA+ enabled and will do up to 42Mbps down and 11Mbps up, while the dual-band Wi-Fi supports the a/b/g/n standards as well as Wi-Fi Direct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that either SIM can be used for data connectivity (most devices limit data connectivity to SIM1), so you can mix and match your carrier plans for maximum bang for the buck. If the carrier supports it, the smartphone will use HD Voice too, which offers higher-quality in-call audio than the old standard, and there's also the IP Dial option for VOIP calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi is also used to wirelessly mirror the display on a Miracast-enabled TV. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.0 and A-GPS. The dedicated Media Share app can take care of this functionality, or you can cast directly from within the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the Wi-Fi transfer app to send images, videos and other files quickly via Wi-Fi Direct, and allows for the other phone to quickly transfer the app from the Idol X+ over Bluetooth if they don't have it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ has both the stock Android browser and Google Chrome. Both are very similar in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsers support both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome has the added benefit of cross-platform sync capabilities that allow you to retrieve open tabs from desktop sessions, for instance, but doesn't have Labs support for test features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One additional advantage of the stock browser on Android 4.2 is Flash support. You'll have to grab an archived version (available on Adobe's web site) but we tried a Flash game and it worked. Less demanding Flash-based sites (there are still a few of those around) work as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar is skinned but mostly unchanged. It features four views: Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The Monthly view shows the days of the month in the top half of the screen and a list of events on the selected day in the bottom half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed File manager will handle files and folders on the built-in memory. It can copy, rename, delete files and folders, one by one or in bulk. You can sort the file list by type, name, size and age, which is great for finding old unused files that are taking up precious storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great tool to have out of the box is the One Touch Cloud Backup app. Despite the name, the app can handle local backups too and you can even schedule them. The app will backup anything from apps through messages to system settings. Dropbox and Box can be used to move the backups to the cloud for safekeeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ToDo app will help with simpler organizational tasks. For something more powerful, Evernote also comes preloaded on the X+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Alcatel's new BoomBand fitness tracker gets its own dedicated tracking application. If you purchase a BoomBand, the app will quickly pair with it and provide info on your daily activities and sleeping habits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a number of small helpful tools. Weather pulls info from AccuWeather (it supports multiple locations). Then there's a voice recorder, compass, flashlight, a barcode scanner and a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Idol X+ comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol X+ comes with a boatload of preloaded apps, and could be seen as too many by some users' tastes, especially when many of them are available as free downloads from Google Play Store. Fortunately, many of this latter type can be uninstalled easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of paid Gameloft games that come with the Idol X+, which Alcatel is kind enough to provide support for through the Smart Live manager. Smart Live will notify you when there are updates available, and also let you download from a small selection of additional games and applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X+ has its downsides. Take the lack of a microSD slot and the non-removable battery, as well as the now ageing Android version and the low loudspeaker volume. The fact of the matter is the Alcatel's Idol X+ is an extremely compelling offering despite its shortcomings. While our benchmarks proved that Mediatek's "true" octa-core chip can't rub shoulders with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, the X+ still has a lot going for it beyond mere horsepower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display, which doesn't have much in the way of advanced tech - no AMOLED or anti-glare coatings here, features a gapless OGS panel that is extremely impressive to look at and interact with. By fusing touchpanel and front glass into one unit, the display effectively gives the illusion of being stamped on the surface of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, dual-SIM capabilities are always a welcome extra, and the fact that both SIMs are hot-swappable make them even more so. Fitting in an extra 500mAh compared to its predecessor while only increasing the thickness by 1mm is also a commendable achievement, as is retaining the respectable 130 grams of weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were surprised that Alcatel chose to go without a microSD card slot for the Idol X+, but they do make up for it by providing a 32GB version. The original Alcatel Idol X does give you expandable storage, but you'll be sacrificing the octa-core chip, dual-SIM support, and some battery capacity for that luxury. Otherwise, camera, display and Android version are all the same, but it's hard to recommend the Idol X as it doesn't come much cheaper than the X+.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Alcatel also provides a phablet variant of its Idol smartphones with the One Touch Hero. Built as competitors to Samsung's Note series, the Hero gives you a bigger screen, battery, and a stylus, but only the single-SIM variant has microSD support, and if you want support for a second SIM card you only get 16GB of non-expandable storage. The Hero is also in a higher price category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alcatel Hero</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung provides some competition in the form of its Galaxy Grand 2 smartphone. The Grand 2 has a slightly larger 5.25" screen, a dual-SIM version, and its 8GB of internal memory is expandable to boot. The screen is only of 720p resolution, however, and it's also larger, thicker, and heavier than the Idol X+, while having only an 8MP camera, and a quad-core 1.2GHz processor. You do get Samsung's arguably superior Android 4.3 version with Touchwiz UI, and it does come in slightly cheaper than the X+.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are not too keen on the Dual SIM functionality, then there is plenty of last year's flagships, which can be had around 300? or slightly more. They all offer top-notch packages and even better specs than the Alcatel Idol X+, not to mention better software update support by major manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 5 and the LG G2 are nearly identical twins in terms of specs and they are both made by LG. Also both sell for around 350?. A bit more dangerous for the 290-euro-worth Alcatel Idol X+ market chances however are the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE and the Sony Xperia Z, which both run for about 300?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Nexus 5 ? LG G2 ? Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch Idol X+ is not without its flaws, but we are quite happy about its raw performance, camera image quality and excellent display. If you are after a smartphone with Dual SIM functionality, you'd be hard pressed to find a better equipped one. We are yet to see where its price would stabilize but as things stand right now, it's a tough sell if Dual SIM is not an absolute must have. We are sure though that given some time, the Alcatel Idol X+ will turn into one of Alcatel's bestsellers, which will attract users with the great component quality and solid performance that the company's products are known for.</paragraph>
