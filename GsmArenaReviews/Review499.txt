			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's flagships have always been playing off each other in a nice but, after a certain point, rather repetitive way. When Sony decided to pass on QHD-screens, it looked like it had the right reasons to keep up with 1080p for flagship generations on end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, however, the company is finally ready for a jump in screen resolution and it's making that jump with a bang. What better way to stir things up than the first 4K display on a smartphone? Meet the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your natural inclination is to be wary of lofty model identifiers "Premium" may give the wrong impression. But we guess Sony just had to come up with an original way of calling its phablet flagship without the involvement of any Plus moniker as the competition does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, the Z5 Premium does bring enough novelties to the series to deserve its name. The first ever 4K display on a smartphone is surely a catchy headline feature, but we shouldn't also miss the fact that it comes spread over a display that's 5.5-inch in diagonal, a size that was so far missing from Sony's flagship portfolio. It is also available in the signature Chrome paintjob, making its rear a near perfect mirror for possibly some nice selfies with the main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides that, you get all the perks that the original Z5 has - the side-mounted fingerprint scanner, the new 23MP camera sensor, the enhanced connectivity, and the more powerful chipset. It's still waterproof too!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the Xperia Z5 Premium plays it safe where it has to and isn't defying the established design language of the Z series. Instead it refines the familiar dual-glass styling and smartens up the looks with the new mirror rear finish and an improved metal frame. We are quite fond too of the discreet fingerprint reader integrated in the power/lock key on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all other manufacturers, native 4K resolution support will only be coming around with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Sony have come up with a clever way of going around that limitation. All the screen graphics - everything about the user interface and most of the apps - is rendered in 1080p (Full HD) and it's then upscaled to UHD, except videos and pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This little trick shouldn't put a stick in Sony's wheels as the Z5 Premium 4K resolution display promises unrivalled visual experience exactly where it matters - in multimedia content consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This must be something to look forward to, isn't it? Well, we're getting there.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It looks like the phone itself got all the premium treatment and there was nothing left for the accessories. There's nothing Premium about the retail box contents of the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, which we got - just a regular 1.5A charger and a USB cable. A headset was missing, but one will be included in the retail package, region dependent, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honestly, we expected at least a bundled quick charger, but we guess that's not covered by the premium tag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium features a bigger display than the regular Xperia Z5, which means it is the first of the Z series with a noticeably bigger footprint. The Z5 Premium measures 154.4 x 75.8 x 7.8mm, which is some 9mm taller, 4mm wider and half a mil thicker than the regular Z5 flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Premium has gained some weight too - at about 180g it's almost 30g heavier than the Z5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coincidentally, that's the exact same footprint (weight not considered) as the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. True, Samsung has squeezed in a 5.7-inch display, but the dual-edge design makes direct comparison impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You would need an Adobe Flash-capable web browser to visualize the interactive 360-degree view above.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The history behind the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium might be quite an interesting one, but we'll probably never know for sure. The Z5 Premium, unlike the Z5 and the Z5 Compact, comes with a reflective glass on the back (no matter the color flavor) and a stainless steel frame similar to the Xperia Z3+. It's almost like the Z5 Premium was supposed to come out with the Z3, but got pushed back a couple of seasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we don't mind the design decision at all, especially the gorgeous chrome version we got. It reflects about as much light as your everyday household mirror, if we're to trust our entirely non-scientific bare-eye tests. Flashy as it is, it all means it's near impossible to keep clean unless you lock it up in a glass display box, which you definitely wouldn't like to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black and gold paintjobs are also reflective, but not even close to the chrome version. It seems to be the signature of the Premium lineup, and it indeed looks captivating, but to keep it this cool, you have to clean it hourly. Maybe it's worth it, who are we to judge?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color aside, the Xperia Z5 Premium looks like any other Z model, especially the black-clad version. Once you look up close you realize it's an odd blend between the materials of the Xperia Z3+ and the detailing of the Z5. Then, of course, scaled up to accommodate the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels very pleasant in hand, but it also demands to be handled with care - the polished metal frame and glass panels are super slippery. A secure grip is nearly impossible, god forbid you leave it on any sloping surface. You've got a premium phone and you have to give it the proper care and attention, that's the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium doesn't look like an experiment or an outsider, but more like the highlight of a generation of Z phones. You can tell it sums up the traditions of the series and keeps the signature elements while putting a little twist that lets it stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has produced a stunning piece of smartphone indeed. It's just one that needs the extra care and attention.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In practice, the Z5 Premium has reasonably thin side bezels with some more meat top and bottom - but overall - the typical Xperia proportions. The front has the stereo speakers, the selfie camera, a couple of sensors and the primary mic hidden below the bottom grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a capless microUSB port on the bottom, a capped card slot on the left and the same corner inserts on the metal frame as the Xperia Z5. We have to warn you both SD and SIM cards reside on a very flimsy plastic trasy, which is very easy to break and even easier to get stuck inside when some of the cards dislodges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor is midway on the right, but did we mention the low position of the volume rocker before? It's between the camera key and the lock key and we found its placement to be very odd and uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint scanner is positioned thoughtfully on the surface of the side Power/Lock key and is very comfy to use. Sony's decision to put it there is an equivalent of LG's rear control deck - an innovative take on a popular feature, which boosts the usability a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scanner is very fast and responsive and we had no problems with the unlocking procedure. It doesn't work when the screen is asleep though, you'll have to push it once with, say your thumb, and if recognized it will open your homescreen in about a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio jack and the second mic are on top of the frame. The entire rear is one big travel mirror with only the 23MP camera lens and the tiny LED flash standing in the way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium is the first smartphone to feature a 4K display or UHD as it's also known. To be more specific it utilizes a 5.5" IPS panel of 2160 x 3840 pixel resolution. The resulting pixel density of 806ppi is well above anything we've seen on a smartphone or even a tablet for that matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K is another name for UHD resolution or 2160 x 3840 pixels. That's an awful lot of pixels - something along the lines of 8.3 million of them. Phones so far had only been able to go as high as 1440 x 2560 pixels (3.7 million pixels). And Sony's own Xperia line has never gone higher than 1080 x 1920 pixels (2 million). So with this phone, we're essentially rocking twice or even four times the usual number of pixels on the screen. An insane jump in resolution, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen in the Xperia Z5 Premium is the first of its kind in a smartphone. It's an amazing engineering feat and it's surely a challenge for any sort of a mobile hardware to pump out so many pixels to the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony made it possible by putting a 4K panel inside the Z5 Premium but rendering mostly everything in 1080p resolution. Yes, it's a concept that you may find a bit hard to grasp at first. The 4K panel the phone utilizes only reveals its benefits when you check out high-res images and video on it (it works with online video too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we approached the phone for a detailed test, we had quite high expectations. We expected to see an image that's infinitely better than what we had seen before. Long story short, that was hardly the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turned out the screen worked just as advertised but the benefits of the higher resolution over say, a 5.5-inch QHD screen, are not readily noticeable with our bare eyes. We did notice an improvement over a 5.5-inch 1080p screen once the 4K high resolution mode kicked in but it was mostly in the way that textures looked smoother, rather than with higher detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we did appreciate however is the fact that at no point did we notice any downsides to the upscaling from 1080p to 4K of the regular interface elements or the apps that don't run in 4K. You shouldn't have any concerns about the picture quality and sharpness when the 4K mode is not used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the upscaling is so good, that there is no easy way to tell when the 4K mode has kicked in. The effect is hardly perceivable with bare eyes and the switch is instantaneous unlike what other reviewers would have you believe, so what we did is we hooked up the phone to the Android SDK and we inspected its events log just to keep track of the turning on and off of the high resolution mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turned out that the Xperia Z5 Premium automatically changes the resolution output once proper content is detected. This means that if you open a high-res image with a proper app such as any gallery or image editor, you would be seeing it in the screen's native 4K resolution. The default gallery works this way for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default video player, as well as the popular MX Player, which we tried, receive the native resolution upgrade as soon as you load up any video higher than 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube app is also allowed to use the screen in its native 4K resolution even though the app settings only offer streaming video resolution of up to 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there is a game that supports 4K resolution, we couldn't find one. The same goes for the few Google Cardboard style VR apps we downloaded for testing. The few games we tried all ran in 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the web browser didn't utilize the high resolution mode either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So yes, the screen is indeed a 4K one and it's indeed capable of showing all those 8M+ pixels. It's just that you can hardly tell the difference over a phone with a QHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, Sony deservedly gets all the 4K screen bragging rights and there is no way anyone's taking those from them. We also think that handling the high resolution mode this way is an excellent balance of user experience, performance and battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the 4K side of things, we also subjected the Xperia Z5 Premium screen to our usual battery of tests and measurements. The maximum brightness of the screen (566nits) turned out quite in line with what we got from the regular Xperia Z5 (583nits) though this one wouldn't go anything higher than that in Auto mode even in bright environment. The level of blacks is similar as well, which works out to a similarly average contrast ratio (966:1) as the Z5's (986:1).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of sunlight legibility, the Z5 Premium is again, pretty comparable to its Z5 sibling. Both get decent scores, but there is still a lot of room for improvement left. It's all down to the relatively high reflectivity of their screens.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like on the Xperia Z5, color rendering without image enhancements is off to a higher extent than we're used to see lately (Avg deltaE 7.1 for the primary colors plus black and white), but it's the white to blame as it has a relatively high bluish tint (deltaE 14.6). Still, you would certainly have a hard time noticing a color cast without a reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color accuracy of course takes an extra hit when you turn on the screen image enhancements such as the X Reality for mobile mode but not as much on the Xperia Z5 (Avg deltaE 7.2 in the Z5 Premium) but the representation of the whites remains unchanged in this mode. The maximum brightness however is reduced in this mode - down to about a maximum of 535 nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, display colors are a matter of personal taste and perception so if you don't need calibrated color output, you will probably be quite happy with the default settings of the Xperia Z5 Premium display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fine tune the display color rendering to an extent as Sony gives you fine grain sliders for adjusting the Red, Green and Blue channel saturation, but the UI is far from user friendly and unlikely to produce any meaningful results without a reference point sitting side by side with the display. Even worse, as soon as you start fiddling with those sliders, the maximum brightness will take a hit. They also don't allow lowering of the saturation of each channel, but only an increase, which is the opposite of what we would try to do with this screen if we're after calibrated color accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium is powered by a beefy 3,430 mAh battery, sealed-in, as expected. It scored an overall endurance rating of 66 hours, which is above average and certainly impressive, having in mind there is a 8M+ pixels on this screen to light up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium definitely did alright in our call and web tests, but it did average on the video test and standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An endurance rating of 66 hours is still above average and it means that the Z5 Premium should be more than happy to offer that many hours of our test pattern usage - one hour of browsing, video playback and calls a day respectively and the rest - standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices. And if it doesn't quite fit your bill, you can easily hop on to our battery life chart and adjust the pattern to your liking for an even more comprehensive comparison.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony is offering the Z5 Premium in both a single SIM and dual SIM variant, just like the Z5. The handset offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE/HSDPA support. LTE is enabled and Sony has multiple regional models to make sure the Xperia Z5 will work with the most widespread 4G networks at Cat.6 speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity features dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP. Satellite navigation is also a given, with GPS and GLONASS or Beidou (market dependent) support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium also has an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone doesn't offer an IR port, but it does come with NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections and now, and since the Z3+, it no longer needs to be covered by a flap to stay water protected. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB host functionality is present, but requires a little more work than simply plugging in a device with an USB OTG adapter. There is a special menu under Xperia Connectivity in the settings that allows you to "discover" a plugged USB device. It still works as expected, but it requires the extra legwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being part of the premium "Z" line has a few other features to mention, like the MHL 3 TV-out support. You can also output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol or Sony's Xperia Connectivity Throw option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also lets you share your media over DLNA by creating a media server, as well as connect to a PlayStation DUALSHOCK 3 (or 4) wireless controller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, the Z5 Premium offers advanced active noise cancelling when paired with a supported handset like the Sony MDR-NC750.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Lollipop with Xperia launcher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium comes with Android Lollipop right out-of-the-box and, even better, the Marshmallow update is already in development. The ROM pre-installed on the Premium is mostly identical to its Z5 sibling in terms of user interface and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android OS on Z5 Premium runs on 1080p resolution, upscaled to 4K. The native high res mode is available only when viewing images and video - including YouTube. Games and VR apps didn't only started in 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Xperia launcher goes, Sony has gone to great lengths to preserve its signature look and feel over the years. This even extends to the bundled applications. Most of them are also practically untouched as far as navigation and UX goes, but now employ all the extra visual eye-candy of Android Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is very simple - it can display some notifications and support quick shortcuts for the camera and the dialer. That's it - no widgets or multiple panes are available. You can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock and in the Z5 Premium even fingerprint, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens are business as usual - there are five of them and you can have up to seven. You can place widgets, app shortcuts, toggles and folders by your choosing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme. You can also choose which icons will be visible on the status bar, and which should remain hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area uses the standard Lollipop-style pull-down effect with multiple levels. Customizable quick settings are on the top and notifications on the bottom. The aforementioned can be accessed by swiping from the top twice, but Sony has also preserved its two-finger swipe gesture, which extends the full shade in one stroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps in various ways. However, in this new version of the launcher the signature left swipe-out menu is gone. Instead it is replaced by a small drop-down menu on the right and the search bar is at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between the recently opened apps, as well as terminate any of them with a side-swipe. Close all key is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia Z5 Premium and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of small apps really tends to differ from one Sony to another for some reason and on our unit we found a default set of nine of those available: Active Clip, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Timer, Touch Block, Music, Bookmarks, Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, you can't disable the small apps entirely and will always have them cramming your recent apps whether you use them or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Specs-wise, the Xperia Z5 Premium is a true flagship, no doubt about it. It runs on a Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 SoC, which is still the chip manufacturer's top offer, at least until the 820 enters mass production along. It has more than enough power to spare, but also happens to be the exact same hardware involved in the Z3+ overheating fiasco.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether it was Sony's fault or a faulty chipset batch doesn't really matter, as, in the end of the day, the Z3+ did, for a fact, overheat quite badly. This bad reputation quickly started dragging down Sony mobile's fortunes and looked like a primary motivator for the quick release of the Z5 family. This did, effectively, push the flagship issue under the rug, but we were happy to report the Xperia Z5 did fine. Unfortunately we have to report that the Z5 Premium still has some issues in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we didn't experience any overheating malfunction and Sony has really gone the extra length to ensure the Z5 series handles heat diligently by employing a dual heat-pipe cooling system and quite a bit of high-efficiency thermal paste, the Z5 Premium heats up like a champ and quite fast at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless whether we are copying files to the PC, running a single benchmark, or watching a video - the Z5 Premium gets unpleasantly hot in its upper part. It won't overheat, but we noticed considerable performance drop in some of the benchmarks (up to 30%) and we witnessed forced brightness lowering in order to avoid overheating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 810 chip, it comes with eight-core processor (Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 &amp; Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57), which is backed up by an Adreno 430 GPU, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expendable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3 and this is where the eight cores get to shine. The Z5 Premium is performing up to par with other Snapdragon 810 devices. It fact, Sony seem to have done a truly terrific job in utilizing the raw CPU power to the fullest extent, outshined slightly only by the OnePlus 2, which has the same chipset. The S810 processor is no match for the Exynos 7420 chip powering the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Meizu Pro 5 but it's a good performer anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. The Z5 Premium does great here, very close to the Galaxy S6 edge+ as a top performer. It definitely blows all of the S810 competition out of the water.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II 2.0 is an all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. Once again, the Z5 Premium shines, especially in the single-core department. It actually leaves behind all of its Snapdragon 810-powered rivals in the overall score, which is impressive. Multi-tasking, however, seems to be a bit lacking, which was also the case with the Z5. However, it is nothing serious, nor is it directly conclusive of real life performance. Our experience with the unit showed fluid performance without exception.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to pure graphics tests and namely GFX Bench. The Adreno 430 GPU inside the Snapdragon 810 chip is pretty powerful and offers nice graphics performance. The Z5 Premium is more than capable of handling even the most demanding Android games, though as we already made it clear, those don't run in 4K resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium uses native 4K resolution only for the gallery content and 4K video playback. Seems like a wise choice as the GPU would probably be strained quite a lot, leading to overheating and poor battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the offscreen and onscreen 1080p tests by GFX Bench - the Xperia Z5 Premium is a match for the Z5, and beats all the rest of the devices we've tested so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the raw performance of the Adreno 430 within the Z5 Premium is indeed top-notch.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In terms of browsing, the Xperia Z5 offers a splendid online experience. BrowserMark definitely backs up our statement, but the all JavaScript Kraken benchmark isn't quite so favorable. Naturally, we would be quick to point a finger at the built-in browser, but in the case of Sony, that is Chrome, so other forces must be at play here.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Overall, The Z5 Premium performance isn't really all that different from the Z5's.The smartphone is a true powerhouse and a worthy flagship in any sense of the word although it comes at the expense of some unpleasant hot spots in the upper part of the back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contacts app uses a tabbed interface, consisting of Contacts, Favorites and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app no longer comes bundled with the phone app, but you can still quickly jump to it from the dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list has a dedicated search field plus it offers a very nicely animated alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports smart dialing, so you can seamlessly search for a number or a name using the corresponding keypad buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium was able to hold onto signal very well. Calls remained uninterrupted and the sound quality was okay even in tight places. Voices came out loud enough. Clarity was also quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise cancellation system is also pulling its own weight ensuring pretty good background noise suppression, as reported by the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium loudspeaker setup is a little on the quiet side and scored a Below Average mark in our loudspeaker test. The score was achieved with Sony's Clear Audio optimization turned off, as it does take away some of the loudness, making the situation even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have definitely seen louder devices, but let's not forget that the Z5 Premium does have stereo speakers, ideally positioned on the front of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This helps for a much more immersive multimedia experience, be it for watching videos, playing games or listening to music and most phones with stereo speakers are hardly chart toppers in terms of loudness. Its score is also fairly comparable to the Z5, so this loudness level comes as no surprise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging hasn't really changed and is the same familiar Xperia experience (yeah it does sound weird), but now with a prettier Material design interface. Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can not only sync with multiple Google accounts, but now has the ability to pull messages from any POP or IMAP server. This does render the default messenger somewhat obsolete, but it still has its place if you want to keep your work communication completely separate from Google.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Album photo gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Album app organizes images into groups of thumbnails and sorts them by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching or even by merely swiping from left or right. It can connect to online albums (Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album app is among the few apps to allow using the native 4K resolution of the screen. It switches to 4K resolution upon opening a high-res image. The resolution is lowered again once you exit the single image viewer. the switch in resolutions is seamless and honestly, our bare eye didn't spot the difference without a side by side comparison to a 5.5-inch 1080p phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be rotated directly in the gallery. Other tools, including crop, filters and effects are available via the Edit option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. The interface is based on a swipe-able menu that sorts your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player to your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music app offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in the volume between tracks, which is great if you're rocking a mixtape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's DSEE HX, which uses an almost wizardly algorithm on compressed music files, like MP3s and restores or rather extrapolates high range sound. According to Sony, the result is near Hi-Res Audio Quality. We aren't quite sure about that, but the processing does seem to boost quality quite noticeably. Also, it only works with wired headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the media server option, when turned on, allows your phone to act like a DLNA server, presenting its multimedia (music, photos and videos) to other DLNA clients in your network - really nifty. Also, you might notice that there is now Spotify integration inside the Music app, it can be enabled or disabled inside the settings menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's also an FM radio tuner with RDS. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly publish an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook straight from the FM radio app. The interface is very intuitive and complete with stunning animations. Possibly one of the best FM radio apps out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you would need to have your headset plugged in for the FM radio to pick up any signal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is good, not quite the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium audio output is pretty much identical to the other two Z5 family members. We were hoping that the most expensive member of the trio would fix the few niggling issues we had with its stablemates, but that's not the case. Still, the Xperia Z5 Premium performed well when connected to an active external amplifier, posting great clarity scores and matching them with just above average loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones harmed the stereo crosstalk but it remained good overall. We also saw some frequency response deviation and brought the volume down a notch, plus a dash of extra distortion and slightly limited dynamic range. None of these is a big deal, but when you have them all you certainly can't call it a perfect performance. Even excellent might be a stretch, considering the price of this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app on the Z5 Premium is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TV series you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast. As for individual episodes of series, the service is still dodgy, but you might get lucky and find the info you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Movies app also supports PlayStation Video service, so if you log in with your PSN account you should be able to use the streaming service hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Movies also minimized your current clip and leaves it in a small window in your bottom right corner when you back out into the menu, just like the YouTube app. This is really convenient and lets you quickly return back to your content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flagship Z5 Premium is more than powerful enough to breeze through 1080p and 4K videos. It had issues with the AC-3 audio codec and failed to load sound in videos carrying it but that's mostly the norm for smartphones these days. The MKV movies went through, but without sound because pretty much all of our samples have AC-3 audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player comes with subtitle support by default, the only requirement is that both file names (video and subtitles) should be identical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 23MP camera with raw potential, but unaccomplished so far<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No proper modern day flagship could be truly complete without a powerful camera and the Z5 Premium definitely makes no exception. Sony has decided to equip the whole Z5 family with a new 23MP camera. That means that the latest Premium sibling should offer a pretty comparable photo quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony might be marketing the new camera as simply a 23MP one, paired with an f/2.0 24mm-equivalent wide-angle lens, but there is actually a lot more going on behind the scenes. The sensor it uses (reportedly. model Sony IMX300) is actually what is known as a multi-aspect sensor and it actually has a bit more pixels - around 25MP to be exact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony doesn't market this officially and instead cited the 23MP resolution or 5520 x 4140 pixels (about 22.85MP) that the phone does in 4:3 mode. Meanwhile, however, the 16:9 aspect ratio mode yields images measuring 5,984 x 3,366 pixels (20.14MP). What you'll notice, is that the 16:9 shots have a higher horizontal resolution than the 4:3 ones, hence they're not cropped from 4:3 as usual, but instead use a different part of a larger sensor. This might not sound like much, but you do actually get comparable resolutions in both aspects, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium has impressively big Field of View (FOV) and can capture a lot more than the others. You can switch it to 16:9 mode and thanks to Sony's multi-aspect sensor you will actually gain some ground horizontally (at the cost at vertical coverage). Here's a quick illustration of the difference in Field of View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The impressive hardware, in combination with the capable Snapdragon 810 chip, makes it possible to shoot UHD 2160p videos at 30fps with the main camera and up to 1080p@30fps with the front-facing one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a dedicated two-stage shutter button, which makes precise focus a whole lot easier. It is a shame that there is no dual-tone flash, but just a plain single LED one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the latest edition of the Xperia camera app, the viewfinder has undergone a few changes, though they don't change the overall user experience. The interface is now scrollable, like on the iPhone, and you switch between Manual, Superior Auto, Video recording, and Advanced shooting modes with a swiping gesture across the screen. The Video recording mode is now separate from Manual and Auto, so this is the end of the shared viewfinder and the anomalies it caused in terms of field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, Superior Auto no longer requires lowering the image resolution and the Z5 Premium can shoot at 5520 x 4140 pixels in both Auto and Manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is an even improved version of what we've already seen in other Xperia phones that came before the Z5 family. There are no settings you can change, everything here is done automagically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia Z5 Premium offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, it's not really all that great. Stitching is clearly visible, resolved detail is poor and so is sharpness. And don't even get us started on the 5MP resolution!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Also a few portrait tools for styling and the quite funny AR mask that overlays another face on top of your own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's new 23MP sensor shows great promise. But regardless of how powerful the hardware is, the camera image quality is still susceptible to recurring issues such as corner softness, high levels of noise and watercolor like effect on fine repetitive detail such as walls, foliage or grass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The edge softness has been persistent on the Sony's cameras. Basically, the quality degrades when you get far from the center, the very edges of the photo can be particularly messy. So it captures more of the scene, but don't place objects of interest at the edge of the frame as you'll lose detail there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed some barrel distortion that weren't straightened out by the algorithm. Such distortion is quite expected with a lens that wide (24mm), but it should be correctable in-camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the new phase detect hybrid auto focus, focusing is indeed lightning fast and unlike with the Z5 Compact, the Z5 Premium got it right every time, even in tough conditions with moving objects. And while the Z5 Premium lives up to the promise of fast autofocus, it still has a lot to catch up with the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Premium camera nailed the white balance every time, the colors are spot on and the autofocus is very fast. The dynamic range is disappointing though and you may have to switch to HDR more often than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in the end the Xperia Z5 Premium produced one of the sharpest photos we've seen lately, but also the ones that show the most signs of over-sharpening. The noise reduction isn't great, leaving noise that gets sharpened afterwards, causing some noticeable artifacts when you view the photo at 100%. Most of the time, however, when you view the photos at a lower resolution (or downscale it to 8MP), they look great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples from the 23MP shooter:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On another positive note, the fast hardware has made the camera app nice and responsive and Sony's legendary Superior Auto mode seems to have gotten better as well. It still has its hiccups and can sometimes toggle to an odd shooting mode, but it generally manages to produce far better photos than a zero-config manual approach. Here are two sets of shots taken in Superior Auto, Manual Mode and Manual Mode with forced HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Superior Auto would occasionally activate the HDR mode, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode and select HDR from Settings. The HDR effect itself looks quite toned down, especially compared to other recent Sony models, like the Xperia M5. That, however, is not necessarily a bad thing, as it does produce nice results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested how the Z5 Premium handles low light conditions and the results weren't exactly impressive. Noise levels are off the chart in the night samples, even those shot with a flash. On a more positive note, at dusk, the Z5 Premium did fairly good with the white balance and contrast, so its flash seems to work well, despite being only "mono" tone (if that's a word). Downscaling those images to 8MP would make them even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, we also tested out the 5.1MP front-facing camera. Photos came out with nice colors and a lot of detail, as one would expect. Here are a few samples at slightly different lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've uploaded the full resolution (23MP) photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 4K video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 23MP camera and powerful Snapdragon 810, the Xperia Z5 Premium has all the required prerequisites to do 4K and should also do a pretty good job of it. It definitely lives up to those expectations, producing pretty impressive results. Videos come out with a lot of detail, nice colors and smooth motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Xperia Z5 Premium features digital image stabilization - SteadyShot, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). Also, it takes a toll on the quality. However, the Z5 Premium does show major improvements in this area - quality isn't severely affected and the stabilization works surprisingly well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way if the option is turned on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has actually done some behind-the-scenes improvements on its video stabilization. Just like with the Z3+, the Z5 Premium uses a combination of software and hardware to do the magic. The latter being an actuator system that shifts the whole lens unit to compensate for shakiness. This is slightly different from OIS and Sony has gone the extra mile to improve the de-shaking process in the Z5 family, by adding a position sensor and introducing a closed loop mode of work with feedback control from said sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One notable absence in the Z5 Premium's new camera app is HDR mode in video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5 Premium shoots gorgeous 4K videos with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels and a steady framerate of 30 fps. The bitrate is also quite impressive at 56 Mbps, coupled with a 48 kHz audio sampling rate, captured in stereo, of course. Resolve detail is really impressive. Overall, the Z5 Premium offers 4K video fit for a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus, however, was far from docile and in typical Sony fashion, the phone hunted for focus while video recording quite a bit. Setting the autofocus to a single focus per video remedies the issue entirely. It is also worth noting that we shot on a pretty windy day, which brought in some shakiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Z5 Premium can also do 1080p videos as well and does a pretty impressive job of it. Furthermore, there is even a 60fps option that also produces impressive results, smoothing out the motion. Below are two 1080p samples at 30fps and 60fps, as well as a 4K you can check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium produced an excellently sharp image in both the 4K and 1080p samples and preserved a lot of information as it shot at the highest bitrate - 56Mbps for 4K, 18Mbps for 1080p and 31Mbps for 1080p at 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the untouched video samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p@30fps (10s, 20MB) 1080p@60fps (10s, 35MB) 4K@30fps (11s, 74MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Xperia Z5 Premium is capable of taking snapshots while shooting videos. This is also very helpful for checking out the actual video quality, so we are attaching snaps of each video if it's easier for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium also features the Office Suite 8, which allows for creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available on board the device by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's New app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there are no known Wi-Fi networks in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, etc. Stamina mode has actually gotten pretty intelligent and can do that for you automatically, so definitely give it a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xperia Transfer mobile has also become a lot smarter. Now it can almost seamlessly help you transition from an older device to your new Sony, be it an Xperia, Android, iOS or Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't fail to mention Sony's upgraded security features, namely the fingerprint reader, ushered with the Z5 family. Embedding the hardware inside the power button is arguably the most convenient implementation of the technology to date and Sony's take works pretty good. It is quick and accurate, you can really simply set it up and then forget it is there, which is the ultimate goal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Lounge is a sort of custom-tailored deal and promotion aggregator. It gives users the opportunity to participate in various Sony promotions and win prizes. Another interesting little feature is the Movie Creator. Its name is pretty much says it all. It has a really nifty "Best Moments" feature that endeavors to create a highlights-only version form a given video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium is also fully equipped as a PlayStation sidekick with access to the PS Network, store and even remote connection to your console and access to its multimedia - movies and music. The way Sony implemented said features is a little odd and does beg the question why you really need to go through two levels of icons, just to launch Spotify, but the PS integration seems to still be in a state of transition and things will hopefully get ironed out soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty is Sony's Lifelog app. It is an all-in-one hub for tracking your activity, daily routine, sleep cycle and more. Generally, if it involves moving, Lifelog endeavors to log it. It is a splendid addition and works pretty well. The app also works great with Sony's Smartbands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS receiver (now complete with GLONASS support). Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium has superb build-quality and stunning design, especially the chrome flavor. The exposed microUSB port is a lot more convenient than Sony's previous covered solution, but the volume keys are somewhat oddly positioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The class-leading display offers 4K resolution and unbelievable 806 ppi density. Maximum brightness is around the Z5 but it's nowhere near as bright as what the Z3+. Contrast also turned average, despite the nice deep blacks. The same goes for color accuracy, which is not up there with the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side-mounted fingerprint reader is really convenient, fast and reliable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is good at 66 hours of endurance rating, but not class-leading. The video playback battery test is disappointing, but admittedly, the Video app (or any other video player) run in native 4K resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Based on Android 5 Lollipop, the Xperia launcher runs quite nicely on the Z5 Premium and is packed with several interesting features. The phone is definitely not lacking on the software side The Marshmallow update should be around the corner too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise, the Xperia Z5 Premium is a true powerhouse, equipped with Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 810 SoC. GPU performance is top-notch. The phone tends to get quite hot on the back and sometimes it takes measures (such as forcing lower brightness) in order to avoid overheating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker setup on the Z5 Premium scored Below Average in terms of loudness, but this is actually ok for a device with stereo speakers. Still, we would have appreciated a bit more boom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality is quite good, though not class-leading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup on the Z5 Premium offers accurate colors and good dynamic range, but sadly samples were still plagued by corner softness and a lot of digital noise, even in the shadows of the bright day. Sony has definitely made some improvements with the new multi-aspect sensor. The electronic video stabilization at 1080p has come a long way and is better than before thanks to some new hardware and software but it doesn't work in 4K recording.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though the 4K mode on the Xperia Z5 Premium may not be always on, this phone will go down in history as the world's first 4K smartphone and this single headline feature is enough to carry it forward. Pricey or not, the Premium is going to do well on the market and we're sure it will account for lots of the positive sales in Sony's annual report.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So is it really the revelation it was supposed to be? -Well, not really. Can you spot a substantial benefit over a QHD screen of the same diagonal with your bare eyes? -No, not really. Is it a phone worth getting? Well, it may as well be - it's still a Sony flagship and that stands for something, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z5 Premium gets most of the feature checklist right - there are the stunning looks, the beasty performance and the high-end camera, which is full of potential. Sony's take on Android and its proprietary apps are great as well, especially with all the visual and functional integration with Sony's PlayStation consoles and BRAVIA TVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the true gem is the 4K IPS display, which offers the groundbreaking 806ppi screen density. There is no denying this is a world-record achievement right there. But there is a catch - you can have native 4K resolution only on multimedia content - when viewing images and playing videos. Everything else runs in an upscaled 1080p resolution, VR apps included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is this way Sony probably saved the Xperia Z5 Premium the headache of some really poor battery life numbers. The even better news is that the upscaling algorithm is so good that you won't even notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the native 4K image shown on the Xperia Z5 Premium doesn't look all that different than the QHD screen on the Galaxy S6 edge+ to our naked eyes. The human eye has its limits and the further the screen is, the less we're able to discern the smallest of details. Perhaps this 4K screen holds great potential for VR as many of our readers were quick to point out, but to really see them, perhaps we'd need to wait to see some specially made VR apps by Sony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z5 Premium faces tough competition in the flagship range even though none of the current smartphones can, of course, match its display resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge+ will make up for the 'lower' Quad HD resolution with a great Super AMOLED screen, a unique curved-edge design and the best still images and video capturing you can enjoy today. Plus, opting for the 5.7" S6 edge+ or its smaller 5.1" Galaxy S6 edge will save you at least ?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also save yourself ?200 and get the regular Sony Xperia Z5 flavor. It matches all the Z5 Premium specs, but the screen - you will be getting a regular 5.2" 1080p IPS unit instead. Oh, but you can't have the Z5 in chrome, so you will be also sacrificing the mirror effect as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Priv costs as much as an Xperia Z5 Premium. It bets on a high-res QHD AMOLED screen with dual-edge screen glass and an iconic sliding-out QWERTY keyboard. And it runs on Android, so how cool is that?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are quite a few Snapdragon 810 smartphones out there and some of them have become quite cheaper lately. Take the LG G Flex2 for example - the curved 5.5" OLED smartphone now costs merely ?250 in Europe and it offers some top of the shelf features (self-healing coating, curved design, OIS, rear keys).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If this doesn't cut it, there is also the all-metal ?440 One M9 with loud front speakers and capable camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus is challenging the Xperia Z5 Premium with even faster performance, tight iOS ecosystem, great panoramic images (with auto HDR) and 3D (Force) Touch support. And it's probably the most expensive mainstream smartphone on the market, so there is that too, if you happen to feel 4K is not catchy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is ahead of the competition for the first time in years with the new Xperia Z5 Premium. It beat everyone to the 4K bandwagon and made the breakthrough first. Will that benefit sales? Most probably, it will. History has proven that the market favors technology pioneers, so Sony should probably do just fine with the Z5 Premium. It's a beautiful phablet, powerful, with some great running software to an extent that it may not even need a 4K screen as a headline feature. The truth is that 4K doesn't really bring any substantial advantages on a smartphone screen - not today at least. But thanks to the Xperia Z5 Premium, the future is one step closer now.</paragraph>
