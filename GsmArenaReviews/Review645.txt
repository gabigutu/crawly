			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the first time we have an Archos smartphone for review here at GSMArena but it isn't the first time we hear the French maker's name. For years now Archos has been churning out tablets with good specs for a reasonable price. They make phones too and you can find them subsidized by carriers in many countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond is the company's flagship phone at the helm of its portfolio. Its highlights include the 5" 1080p IPS LCD on the front, the 16MP camera on the back and the 64-bit Snapdragon 615 chipset and 2GB of RAM inside. The 50 Diamond also boasts dual SIM abilities out of the box without compromising its microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Together the main specs round off a reasonable upper midrange handset that can challenge competition from Samsung, HTC and China for the hard-earned cash of buyers. Perhaps one of the more important aspects of the Archos 50 Diamond is that it runs vanilla Android 4.4.4 KitKat out of the box catering to Google-purists that would otherwise cringe at yet another Android skin that contradicts Google's design aesthetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond review unit we received is the flamboyant lime-colored unit but there is a more subdued black variant as well. The popping color could sway the younger audience and maybe some die-hard Borussia Dortmund fans too (if soccer is your thing to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos is aiming the 50 Diamond as a capable device that could be easily associated with Google's Android more than with Archos - hence the choice of UI. You're most likely to find the device on specific retailer's shelves or mostly on your carrier's website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While not a rival to the high-end smartphones of 2015, the Archos 50 Diamond looks to be a perfectly capable upper-midranger. At around ? 250 at the moment it's also an affordable phone that would be good for multimedia consumption thanks to its good chipset, ample and high-res screen and ample storage due to the microSD expansion. It's also a good phone for users with the need for dual SIM and also LTE connectivity for a reasonable price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera also sounds promising and packs 1080p video recording - which is still more than fine to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So stay around as we delve into the hardware prowess of the Archos 50 Diamond.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond comes packed with a microUSB cable, headphones with volume control and microphone and an A/C adapter rated at 1A.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Archos has gone with a simple yet elegant design for the 50 Diamond. The front offers a clean and flat design accented by a small chin at the bottom that carries over the color of the wrap-around back panel. There are no on-screen buttons - those are replaced by capacitive touch buttons for home, back and menu under the screen. The buttons light up ever so slightly and mostly stay out of the way. The screen blends in with the rest of the black front resulting in a very clean, incognito look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond is a little taller than its 5" screen diagonal might suggest. It measures 146 x 70.4 but it's reasonably thin at 8 mm. The weight is acceptable at 142g rounding off a balanced frame that's not too heavy nor too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is much less flat. There are curves for the sides and also the camera hump. You can get the Archos 50 Diamond in black but our unit sports a fresh yellow paintjob that turns outright electric under certain lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel remains clean in its design. Aside from the camera hump and LED flash there's only a subtle back-facing speaker grille that sits in the bottom corner and completes the design package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Archos 50 Diamond are flat but have a slight bevel were they meet the back. There's also a very subtle curve to the top and bottom of the phone making it appear a little tilted under certain angles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Archos 50 Diamond hosts a 5" IPS LCD of 1920 x 1080px resolution, 8MP front-facing camera, earpiece and three capacitive touch buttons under the display for home, back and menu. Holding down the home button prompts up Google Now while a double tap will open up the task switcher interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no option in the software to add on-screen buttons to the Archos 50 Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a power button and volume rocker on the left side of the 50 Diamond and only the slit to take off the back panel on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is where the microUSB port and main microphone are and opposite we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the main microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera lens protrudes a bit on the back's upper side. Next to it there's a single LED flash. The single speaker is on the bottom left under a grille. There are two miniscule nobs on either side of the speaker that ensure it won't get muffled when the phone is lying on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back panel reveals the non-replaceable 2,700 mAh battery, the two microSIM slots and the microSD card slot. You can see the NFC antenna glued to the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rounded sides and back panel feel very comfortable in the hand and the whole phone slides through the palm and fingers. However fans of square, sharp phones will have to make adjustments here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5" 1080p IPS LCD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Archos 50 Diamond is a 5" IPS LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080px and a resulting pixel density of 440 ppi. That's plenty sharp on paper and also in practice - everything from icons to text is rendered pixel-sharp and is very pleasing to the eye. 2.5K displays on recent smartphones are a bit sharper but 1080p is certainly good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under a microscope the pixel arrangement can be seen. It's a standard RGB one with equal in size and number red, green and blue pixels that make up the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers from our dedicated display test we can see very good contrast and good brightness levels from the Archos 50 Diamond. Compared to its peers the 50 Diamond also offers deeper blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility determines the contrast of the display under sunlight and also the level of reflectivity. The Archos 50 Diamond posts a middling result which is nonetheless above average for a midrange smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The non-removable 2,700mAh battery of the Archos 50 Diamond was above average in our tests. It managed a 60 hour endurance rating with average browsing, above average video playback and superb talk time endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our dedicated standby test the Archos 50 Diamond endured around 340h with a single SIM inside and 240h with both SIM slots occupied - both good numbers. Note that the endurance rating below features the stand-by with two SIM cards. If we were to factor in the single SIM standby performance, the endurance rating would rise to 64h.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSDPA and HSUPA, as well as quad-band LTE support with band 1(2100), 3(1800), 7(2600), 20(800) support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes dual-SIM, dual-standby functionality by default - 3G and LTE are supported only on SIM1, while SIM2 can tap into 2G GSM networks only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 50 Diamond has Wi-Fi with Direct functionality but interestingly can't see any 5GHz networks, leading us to believe it's a single-band radio. Bluetooth 4.0 is also on board with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also stream your display via the Wireless Display feature (Miracast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as expected, GPS support is also available, but not the GLONASS variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also FM Radio and NFC but no IR port and no way to get wired TV Out functionality either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vanilla Android KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Archos went with a stock version of Android 4.4.4 KitKat to take the software lead on the 50 Diamond which means you'll get an uncluttered experience that should also provide a snappier feedback thanks to the lack of bloatware and additional app services. The use of vanilla Android also promises timely updates and Archos is already working on a Lollipop build for the 50 Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a quick look of the UI below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen widgets remain unchanged and are full-screen, resizable tiles. One of them is always visible at the top of the main lockscreen, above the padlock icon. The rest are a right swipe away. The widget on the main lockscreen is collapsed to make room for the padlock button, but can be expanded to display additional information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few stock lockscreen widgets: Messages, Calendar, Gmail, Digital Clock, Google Now and Google+. The camera shortcut, just like before, is a left swipe on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is almost the same as Google's Now launcher but lacks the latter as the leftmost pane by default. You can always install Google Now launcher to get the exact same stock appearance. Another difference is the lack of on-screen buttons on the Archos 50 Diamond but that means that more screen estate is available to the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders function as expected. A folder is created by dropping an app shortcut on top of another shortcut and can be named by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to show the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification center and Quick toggles are on board too. They're accessible via an icon in the top right corner of the notification area. You get access to key device settings such as brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, location, mobile networks and battery. Some toggles are directly accessible shortcuts to their respected functions in the settings menu. The quick settings menu can be accessed by a two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a downward swipe. The top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Managing the homescreen is easy. You can add widgets, shortcuts or folders. You can add as many panes as you want. The wallpaper is easy to change too - just pick one of the preloaded ones or choose an image from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets aren't part of the app drawer. You can access the widget list only by a tap and hold on an empty space on the homescreen and selecting the dedicated Widgets shortcut. We prefer this way of handling the widgets, because they don't get in the way of the day-to-day work with the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer consists of 6 rows of icons on side-scrollable pages. The app icons are big and easy to access. The apps are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option. Placing a shortcut on the homescreen works as you would expect: press and hold to grab it and then position it on the homescreen pane of choice. Two more options appear at the top of the screen while you're dragging - Uninstall (to quickly remove apps) and App info, which opens the application's entry in the Manage applications list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the Recent Apps list has remained virtually unchanged. It would be nice if Google finally adds a kill all/close all option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Android 4.4.4 KitKat offers a polished UI and turns in great performance on the Archos 50 Diamond and its Snapdragon 615 platform. Animations are quick and smooth and there were no stutters anywhere to be found. But more on the performance on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Snapdragon 615 chipset inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond sports a Snapdragon 615 chipset with what you may call a dual quad-core chipset consisting of a quad-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 plus a quad-core 1.0GHz Cortex-A53 processors. There is also 2GB RAM and an Adreno 405 GPU. While the Snapdragon 615 is a 64-bit chipset, it's aimed at midrange to upper-midrange performance and won't challenge the higher-specced devices on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've selected a number of the Archos 50 Diamond's peers to do battle on the synthetic benchmarking front and as usual will divide the performance by CPU, GPU and browsing. The first task sees the Archos 50 Diamond in a middling position - the compound Geekbench 3 and AnTuTU 5 place it below devices like the Samsung Galaxy A7 and Oppo R6 which offer the same chipset. The 50 Diamond manages to beat the Desire 820 in AnTuTu 5 but gets served by the HTC smartphone in Geekbench 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU-focused Basemark OS 2.0 shows a good overall score for the Archos smartphone followed by the same results in both the single and multi-core breakdowns.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The graphic-intensive GFXBench shows how the GPU performs at 1080p resolution in the T-Rex and more demanding Manhattan tests. None of the devices here post playable, stutter-free 30fps results and we see more or less similar performance between the smartphones in the list. In the on-screen test the Archos 50 Diamond loses handily to smartphones with lower resolutions such as the Desire 820 and the ZTE Blade S6.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The final two tests evaluate the JavaScript and HMTL 5 performance. Kraken 1.1 by Mozilla shows a very good score by the Archos 50 Diamond but still not close to the top. BrowserMark 2.1 places the 50 Diamond as the second in the list of HTML 5 performers - a very good score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we factor in all of the scores we can extrapolate that the Archos 50 Diamond is in line with other smartphones that use the Snapdragon 615 chipset and is slightly better than those using the Snapdragon 410 chip. Graphics take a hit compared to 720p smartphones but that's to be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we like to point out, the benchmark data hardly represents the true day to day performance. In practice the Archos 50 Diamond is great and that could easily be attributed to the mix of stock Android and the Snapdragon 615 chipset. We didn't experience stutters and everything was smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond obviously doesn't feel as fast as a flagship smartphone in 2015 but fares very well compared to similarly-priced phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is clean and simple. Its main screen is where everything is laid out - there's a search bar on the top, the last dialed number beneath it and the most-dialed contacts just below. You can get to all contacts or you can open up the call log, dialer and settings through the three icons at the bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search bar can handle contact search but there is also smart dialing from which you can find people in your list of contacts. The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add various new fields to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calling quality with the Archos 50 Diamond was nice and clean and we enjoyed plenty of volume and a crisp sound. The signal held on well in our testing and we didn't experience call drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Archos 50 Diamond is dual SIM you can choose which SIM card will use data connection, meaning only one will be able to enjoy 3G and 4G connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conventional call blocking via black listing isn't available but you can always choose to send a certain number to voice mail. There's no Do Not Disturb mode to filter notifications during the wee hours, though - a feature we consider a must-have in a modern smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speakerphone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond posted below average loudness levels in all three of our loudspeaker tests - pink noise, ringing and voice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging, email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can choose Google Hangouts or the default messaging app to handle your text messages. Hangouts has two pages - the first one shows all of your conversations, while the second lists the people you exchanged Hangouts with, plus suggested contacts and other contacts (a.k.a. from your phonebook).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app and the generic email app are now almost identical in both looks and functionality. They feature color-coded sender images, based on the first letter of the sender's name. Both apps support multiple accounts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google keyboard is the default text input option out of the box. It is one of the most preferred Android keyboards out there and its keys are comfortably large in both portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gesture typing is available as usual. Naturally, it benefits from the already existing Android word prediction, so you can just click on the words the keyboard suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - Select word and Select All - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a word has a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is available as well and it works great too. It doesn't even require network connection if you download the specific language file and make it available for offline usage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock gallery and Google Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond comes with the old stock Android gallery, prior to Photos. It's aptly named Gallery and is a simple collection of all your photos, grouped into Albums, Locations, Times, People and Tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also incorporates an editor that offers filters and editing like crop, straighten, exposure, vignetting, contrast, shadows, highlights and vibrance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos integrates with Google backup and offers a very powerful editor. It organizes images by photos, stories, albums, photos of you and incorporates videos too. The Auto Awesome can brighten your photos automatically for you and upload them to Google+ if you so desire. Like Picasa before it, Photos shows your online albums as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music with Snapdragon Audio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is the default music player. It features Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music also gives you the option to upload music onto the Google-branded cloud and stream it on your device via Wi-Fi or mobile data. There's also the nifty option of downloading the content onto the device if you want to have there for connection-less times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music uses the built-in equalizer which in this case is the Snapdragon Audio+. It packs a five-way equalizer with different presets like Rock or electronic along with Bass Boost and Virtual Surround dials. You can also set up the sound to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones enables the FM radio. It can find stations for you and save them. You can also blast through the speaker but the headphones need to remain attached as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Archos Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multimedia package is completed by the Archos Video app. Its default screen can show you movies, TV shows and all videos as well as video content from external sources like SMB, UPnP and FTP. Archos Video can find movie information online and fill it in for your own content, similarly to Sony's Movies and other such apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player itself has a very powerful interface. It has on-screen sliders for both sound volume and brightness and can also find subtitles from the built-in storage and online from OpenSubtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of codec support the Archos 50 Diamond was a mixed situation. Videos that use the AC-3 sound codec all failed to play and some with the AAC sound were a no-go as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No WMV files were able to play as well and 2K and 4K videos were too much for the Archos to handle. The usual DivX, AVI and Xvid files weren't an issue as long as they didn't use the AC-3 codec and all the MKV files we tested came out smooth and issue-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We couldn't give a reading on the audio quality as we had some issues with the equalizer on the Archos 50 Diamond. We're looking into the issue.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>16MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera app aboard the Archos 50 Diamond is the default KitKat app which Google replaced with its Google Camera app - which you could download on the Archos 50 Diamond too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to hold a finger anywhere in the viewfinder to get to the quick settings. Using swipe gestures you can toggle the HDR mode, exposure, settings for picture size, white balance, timer, geo-tagging, scene mode, flash on or off and switching to the front-facing camera. While it's feature-rich, it doesn't strike us as the most useful of way of navigating the camera app in our mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick settings can also be triggered by touching the corresponding icon atop the virtual shutter button. You can choose Camcorder, Panorama and Photosphere through the underlying shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder is annoyingly thought-out. It shows you a 16:9 feed while snapping photos in 4:3 aspect. So in essence it's a real task to frame your photos right and you cannot opt for the native aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama can also be found on the Archos 50 Diamond but there's no Photosphere but again you can get that through Google's own Camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a heap of settings on the Archos 50 Diamond that will shape the photos you want to take with the device. Aside from the confusing naming scheme of the camera settings - there are separate labeled More Options - they give a comprehensive amount of control - picture quality (Jpeg from 55% to 100%, Normal, Fine and Super Fine), ZSL (zero shutter lag, although we didn't really see a difference), timer, burst mode, auto HDR, face detection, exposure and focus lock, levels for saturation, contrast, sharpness, exposure metering (center weighted, frame average, spot metering) and compensation (from -2 to +2), anti-banding, ISO, white balance, focus mode (auto, infinity, macro, normal and continuous autofocus), and finally red-eye reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list a bit redundant and although we appreciate the effort in bringing so much control, the settings are buried in three different settings menus that aren't convenient to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And all of this means nothing if the sensor output isn't good. Luckily it is - the photos from the 16MP camera are quite good in capturing the scene details and offer sharpness almost through the entire frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>White balance proved spot on and produced true whites but the overall color representation could be a little warmer. The only true issue we spotted was a fair bit of noise, especially in mono-colored areas like the sky - the noise is blotchy and unpleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range is above average but far from class leading. There is a lot of highlight detail in the images but shadows aren't as impressive when the lighting conditions are not ideal. Still the Archos 50 Diamond offers above average dynamic range as we said.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro shots came out on par with the good light ones - plenty of detail to go around and very sharp objects. There is a bit of desaturation behind the object which accentuates it further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode didn't impress us in the least. For starters you'd need to drop the resolution from 16MP to 13MP and to add insult to injury the software doesn't mention this anywhere - we needed to guess what the problem was. High dynamic range shooting didn't produce better results which is the bigger grief here - highlights received a slight bump in exposure but shadows remained the same for the most part. The Archos 50 Diamond also took a lot of time to snap an HDR shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another place where Google's Camera could be beneficial is panorama mode - the stock camera on the Archos 50 Diamond just doesn't cut it. Panoramas come with a very low resolution and little to no detail whatsoever. It would be better to just take series of regular 4:3 16MP shots and stitch them yourself as they would have more resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally here's a sample taken with the front-facing 8MP camera of the Archos 50 Diamond. As with every front-facing unit we've tested so far we don't see much to praise here - the resolution is there but the detail is not suiting for it. But the front-facing camera does get the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Archos 50 Diamond is good, despite its lackluster HDR performance and useless panorama mode. In good light you'll get great photos with above average detail. Processing keeps things sharp but not oversharpened and the toned-down saturation could be easily dealt with via the dedicated settings in the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond was reasonably fast to capture a photo too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder shares the interface of its stills counterpart. The Archos 50 Diamond is capable of video capture at a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080px at 30fps from the back camera and 720p from the front-facing 8MP one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an option for timelapse video and you can choose the number of seconds, minutes or hours you want a photo taken and then the duration of the video and also the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos captured with the Archos 50 Diamond don't shine with great detail. Objects are grainy with low sharpness and the focus was constantly hunting to get a better lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is also way lower compared to stills and the scene came out overexposed. Otherwise videos are fluid and retain a constant 30fps throughout. Colors are also a bit warmer too. Here goes a sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Chrome at the helm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the available settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option does what it says on the tin - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) before sending them to your phone thus saving you data traffic volume and bandwidth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Calendar received a major overhaul. The app features sleek new look that features different graphic for each month. It can automatically add events straight from your Gmail account, so you don't need to worry about flights, dinner reservations and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now add photos and maps to your calendar events. A button to add events can be seen at the bottom right of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Keep is preinstalled on the Archos 50 Diamond. It begun as a note-taking app but has evolved into a note and to-do app with color coding, reminders with time and even location markers and syncs effortlessly to any other device that supports Keep - even your PC or Chrome browser though an extension.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos also supplies its own file manager aptly named Files. It does a good job of moving and copying apps as well as the basic renaming, creating a folder and checking the contents of folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could also handle files through Google Drive and it gives you 15GB of free storage for all of your files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer) is available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a trusty calculator aboard the Archos 50 Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you get the Google Play store and Google Maps, concluding the app package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Good build quality, capacitive buttons don't take up display space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display has good contrast and reasonable brightness, above average sunlight legibility</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is good with great call times, adding a second SIM inside deducts 100 hours of stand-by</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vanilla Android KitKat is fluid and bloatware free</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 615 performs as expected - good CPU performance but unimpressive graphics results</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker loudness is below average</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great video player with online subtitle download; unfortunately, none of the videos with AC3 sound worked</paragraph>
			<paragraph>16MP photos come with sharp and with good detail, though a bit noisy; HDR and Panorama modes are a disappointment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are ok, but nothing special</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our testing we found the Archos 50 Diamond above average to very good. We have to admit that we were surprised at times by its performance - especially in areas like the still camera. It takes many big names in the mobile space years to make a good camera and Archos has done it easily with their first real flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also liked the design put forward by the 50 Diamond, although we can't say we've grown fond of the name. The yellow back suits the flat black body well and the display does well to blend in with the rest. The feel of the device was very good as well and we got used to the left-placed power button easily enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything about the Archos 50 Diamond proved good and we're hard-pressed to call any of its shortcomings deal breakers. The Snapdragon 615 chipset will give most users enough power to work with, the battery life is good, the user interface is not some ugly representation of a skin but actual vanilla Android and the camera is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the price consideration. Archos sell their smartphone for the reasonable 230 euro, which puts it in a good position against tough competition in the midrange market. The latter is business as usual as most makers make their bread and butter here and not in the high-end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the competition there are a few names that are worth mentioning. The second generation Moto G is here with a 5" 720p display and Snapdragon 400 chipset. It's nothing special on paper and can't match the Archos 50 Diamond on pure specs but does come with better customizability and is cheaper and easier to buy subsidized or otherwise. Also the Moto G either has or is getting Android Lollipop too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G (2nd gen)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next candidate is better-equipped than the Archos 50 Diamond and costs much more but does share a chipset with it. The similarities end there as Oppo R5 has a 5.2" AMOLED panel of 1080p resolution and 13MP camera not to mention a metal and glass body which is impressive and offers a more premium feel. The price difference is something to consider, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo R5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's S90 Sisley looks prettier than the Archos 50 Diamond and despite having just 720p screen resolution, it puts a SuperAMOLED panel on the table. There's also a 13MP camera on the back and 8MP on the front. The Lenovo costs around the same as the Archos 50 Diamond too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo S90 Sisley</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another device that can challenge the 50 Diamond is the Huawei Honor 6. It sports a 5" 1080p display and a superior chipset but costs more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei Honor 6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the same price as the Archos 50 Diamond you could opt for ZTE's Blade S6. It's screen is 720p but the chipset is the same and there's a capable 13MP camera on board. It also matches the Archos 50 Diamond for its expandable storage and offers dual SIM and LTE. The software of choice is close to stock Android and it's the newer generation Android Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> ZTE Blade S6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond has a good set of specs and in order to get a better smartphone you'd really need to shell out more money. Some of the phones mentioned above are more expensive while sporting just 720p displays that aren't as sharp as the 1080p panel on the 50 Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that Archos need to worry about is placing their flagship in the hands of users and spreading the word that the phone is worth buying. As it stands, it would be hard for you to get an Archos 50 Diamond outside of the select markets the French maker operates on. Still the US is covered and so is a big part of Europe. Users in Asia already have a wider variety of cheaper brands to choose from anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50 Diamond is an above average smartphone that possesses some good and some very good qualities. It won't dethrone the Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S but could push some midrangers outside of their comfort zones.</paragraph>
