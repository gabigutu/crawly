			<paragraph>Here we are at one of the hottest spots of the Mobile World Congress 2009. The Samsung booth hosts quite a number of really cool devices including the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. Samsung high-end phones are all about touch UI, GPS receivers and OLED displays this year. And guess what - we happen to really dig the combination of all those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The world's second largest mobile phones manufacturer announced more than twenty new phones at the start of the Mobile World Congress and quite naturally we were really eager to check out all the interesting players.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is definitely among the highlights of the MWC 2009. The incredibly powerful all-round device has a specs sheet that is unprecedented in the GSM world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This monster of a handset comes with a 3.7" OLED capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 640 x 360 pixels, capable of displaying up to 16 million colors. An 8 megapixel shooter with the industry-first 720p HD video recording at 24fps has made headlines well before the official launch. The other imaging assets include geo-tagging, face and smile detection and WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i8910 Omnia HD runs on the latest Symbian S60 5th smartphone touch UI. On the connectivity side, the device is just as well prepared as in imaging, offering Wi-Fi with DLNA, Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP, a standard microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack and TV-out. A GPS receiver with A-GPS is aboard along with the optional Samsung Mobile Navigator by Route66.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD comes in two flavors: with 8 or 16GB of integrated memory, that both have a hot-swappable microSD card slot handling up to 16GB in turn. The other notable features include DivX/XviD support, accelerometer for screen auto rotate, proximity sensor for auto screen turn-off and FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i8910 OmniaHD is a quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE handset with tri-band UMTS support topped with HSDPA (up to 7.2 Mbps) and HSUPA (up to 5.76 Mbps) support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have done a great job customizing the standard S60 UI that we've already seen in Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. The TouchWiz homescreen plugin is installed on top of the Symbian S60 5th edition OS, bringing a really improved homescreen usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other nice touches to the user interface include changing the camera interface, which is now very user-friendly, unlike the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo contacts screen is another novelty where you can dial contacts by simply clicking on their photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is one hell of a device even though it is quite a large device. but you've got to understand there is no way of including that many features and a 3.7" screen on anything much smaller than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to take a few sample snapshots with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD camera. The 8 megapixel camera is undoubtedly one of the main features of the device but since the device is still far from complete the quality of the samples is quite lower than what the final units are going to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However even at this pre-release unit managed to record really impressive HD video clips. With plenty of detail and quite acceptable frame rate the video quality is way better than what we have ever seen from a mobile phone. There are still some tidbits to fix but we are quite confident that this will be done before the handset hits the shelves. A quick glimpse at the recorded clips details almost made our jaws drop, revealing a bit rate of 7800 kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go and check them out over at Vimeo if you prefer watching them straight from your browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video 1 at Vimeo (recompressed)</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video 2 at Vimeo (recompressed)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching HD videos on the i8910 Omnia HD is also a really cool pastime.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH is a fully touch-operated slider that features a 2.8" OLED scratch-resistant capacitive touchscreen display with WQVGA resolution (240 x 400 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dressed to impress with a slim 12.7 mm body and a finely brushed metal frame, the S8300 UltraTOUCH also has the features to do so. The handset comes with an 8MP autofocus camera with dual-LED flash that can capture videos up to WVGA resolution at 30fps. Next are the built-in GPS with A-GPS support, Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP, microUSB and the microSD memory card slot. FM radio with RDS is also on board, making Wi-Fi the only major abscence here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH partially compensates for that with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE as well as 3G with HSDPA (7.2Mbps) support. The handset also comes with the sweet DviX and XviD support, meaning that you don't have to convert your favorite videos to mp4 for watching them on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH will run on the latest reincarnation of the company's proprietary TouchWiz user interface. It brings quite a number of improvements over the previous edition including new widgets, photo contacts like the Omnia HD and an improved image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH was actually announced a week before the Mobile World Congress and we already previewed an early sample of the device from the comfort of our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the units here at the Samsung booth are quite more brushed up and we simply couldn't miss the chance to take some live photos of one of the coolest looking device recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some live photos of the final design which will most probably find its way to the retail units. We are in fact quite fond of the looks of this handset and its UI also seems to perform pretty impressively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were several things that managed to impress us about the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH. For one, the touchscreen was really responsive and the picture quality of the display was simply amazing. As far as the ergonomics are concerned the device is hardly spectacular but that is compensated for by the slim silhouette and the really nice looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got a glimpse of the two extra color versions of the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH that the Korean company will offer. The blue version will appear on the market along with the red one, while the one with the black keypad will be released a while later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also managed to take several sample shots with the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH camera. Have a look at those now:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we captured a couple of WVGA videos with the handset and those turned out simply great. We were quite surprised by the quality this relatively compact phone was able to pull even now at this pre-release stage.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH is expected to start shipping in March 2009 with an estimated price of 549 euro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M7600 Beat DJ<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other than video, Samsung seem pretty keen on music too with their utterly revamped Beat family that features the M7600 Beat DJ and M6710 Beat DISC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3G-enabled Samsung M7600 Beat DJ is a distinctly shaped touchscreen using the latest TouchWiz interface. It features a 3 megapixel snapper with autofocus and VGA video recording at 15 fps, a 2.8" OLED touchscreen display, GPS receiver and 3G support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those phones, Samsung continue a long standing partnership with Bang&amp;Olufsen and their power-saving ICEPower audio amplifiers but the real boost to the music experience are the BeatDJ application and the new music player interface called Disk UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beat DJ turns your device into a small DJ deck - a software mixer it allows you to tune a music track with filters, scratching, sampling and effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the music player Disk UI is a jukebox style album browsing, which represents the albums as vinyl records with album art printed on them. It's actually quite nice to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features of the Samsung M7600 Beat DJ include an accelerometer for screen auto rotation, proximity sensor for auto screen turn-off, FM radio with RDS, DivX/XviD video support. The must haves 3.5mm audio jack, FM radio and microSD card slot (for storing your favorite tracks) are aboard too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out our Samsung M7600 Beat DJ preview, for some higher-quality shots of the device and more insights. We had a rather early sample unit at the time of writing the review so the retail version of the handset will probably have some UI differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From what we saw at the MWC - the Beat DJ Disc UI now offers even more eye-candy and is more responsive. However you are yet unable to use your own samples when mixing tracks. The guys at the booth assured us that this will be taken care for in the retail version of the handset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M6710 Beat DISC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second Beat fellow is the Samsung M6710 Beat DISC slider. It's a slightly downgraded variation of the M7600 but has a large 2.6-inch 16M color TFT screen, a 3 megapixel snapper with QVGA@15 fps video recording, 3G support and a 3.5mm audio jack. Beat DISC also uses the latest TouchWiz interface with the Disk UI music player preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of Samsung M6710 Beat DISC brought us memories of the Nokia 3650 but the user experience it provided is really good. It seems as a genuinely nice phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7350 Ultra s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7350 goes by the name of Ultra s and that's a moniker that sets the style-conscious Samsung-loving gang aflame. To set it straight, the new Ultra is not ultra-thin but seems to stake much on the fascia too. The superscript S clearly marks the slider form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7350 has a 2.6" WQVGA screen and some high-end design elements borrowed from the headliner S8300 UltraTOUCH.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7350 Ultra s is the first handset on the Samsung booth we photographed that doesn't feature an OLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7350 Ultra s also features a built-in GPS receiver, a 5 megapixel autofocus camera comes with PowerLED, face detection, geotagging and D1 video recording at 30 fps. An FM radio is also aboard and so are HSDPA, microSD card slot, USB and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have a look at our Samsung S7350 Ultra s preview to find more information about the handset and a whole bunch of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7350 Ultra s is expected to start retailing in March 2009 with an estimated price of 349 euro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7220 Ultra b<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next on our MWC 2009 Samsung booth tour comes the S7220 Ultra b. The handset looks really cool, having the same brushed metal frame like the S8300 UltraTOUCH. Samsung have obviously picked this element as their design cornerstone and lucky for us we happen to be quite fond of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notably, the S7220 Ultra b is another new release by Samsung to feature an OLED screen - a 2.2" QVGA unit of 262K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A wealth of color hues and new background animations are available across the new Flash-based UI, which is a shared feature of Samsung's new Ultra lineup. Accelerometer-based action includes screen auto-rotation, turn-to-mute and the motion image viewer pioneered in the Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera is accompanied by a LED flash and there is also an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already had the chance to get a Samsung S7220 Ultra b in our office so you might go and check our preview of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b is expected to hit the market in March 2009 with an estimated price of 329 euro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i7410 projector phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7410 projector phone is one to definitely check out. Blending mobile phone functionality with a portable projector, this is quite an extraordinary gadget and you know we dig those big time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7410 is able to project videos of HVGA resolution (480 x 320 pixels) on a 5 to 50 inches diagonal. While this isn't anything spectacular for a dedicated projector unit, it certainly is a feat for a mobile phone that isn't even Nokia E90-large.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually we expected the Samsung i7410 to be much larger than it turned out to be. Now don't get us wrong - the phone is no midget, but having seen a few dedicated projectors, we're quite happy with the Samsung i7410 size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd also probably want to know that the projector beam has manual focusing (see that roller right next to the lens?), as well as you can use the handset as a torch in the dark thanks to the dedicated app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7410 has enough battery to project a movie for 60 to 80 minutes, which is acceptable though not really exceptional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video we took, that shows how the projector phone works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S1100 watch phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our tour around the Samsung MWC 2009 booth finishes with another pretty unusual device. As the world's third largest cell phone manufacturer LG is already about to release their own wrist watch phone, those devices are obviously enjoying more than enough interest. Well, big dogs are on the wrist watch bandwagon, so let's see what they've got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are rushing to join the party by showcasing their S1100 wrist watch phone. It remained behind glass for the time of the event so we cannot provide you with too much first-hand info about it. Its features include a full touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and a speakerphone and that's basically all we found out. Nonetheless, here go the photos of the device so you have a better look at its exterior.</paragraph>
