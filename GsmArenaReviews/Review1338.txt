			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's June again, time for Apple to make headlines. The WWDC is over and the iOS 5 and the iCloud are now official. It won't be before the fall though that the iOS 5 will officially launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Apple has given us a taste of the iOS 5 by releasing a developer preview soon after the announcement. We went on to update an iPhone 4 with the beta release and we are ready to share our first impressions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we continue, let's take a look at the most important features to premiere on the iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, there's still plenty of stuff missing and some of the things will probably never make it to the iOS. Here is a list of the things we continue to miss:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still missing:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, the list is notably shorter than last year's. It's debatable though whether Apple listened to the users or just filled their time with low-priority features that have been on the list for quite some time. Either way, some of the new stuff is quite good so let's waste no more time on introductions. Follow us on the next page where we start to explore the iOS 5 at close range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface on iOS 5 - Notifications, Lockscreen camera key, Newsstand<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple's iOS must be already approaching the final stage of its evolution. The platform has certainly been through a lot. This is the fourth major update, and it brings less change than the others. It's not to say the iOS is finally close to what Apple had in mind for it. And by the way - what Apple has in mind is not necessarily what users have come to take for granted or other platforms have had forever. But when you have the standard-setting touchscreen interface you can afford to make your own rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, iOS may as well be still a few updates away from a complete overhaul, the scale of Windows Phone 7. So let?s focus on the here and now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple says the iOS 5 brings more than 200 new features. We didn't bother count, but the really interesting things are about 40 at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There have been virtually no visual changes to the core interface. The only new thing you'll notice are the new toggles in the settings menu ? they're now circles instead of squares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go straight to one of the most important novelties though - the iOS 5 has a new approach to Notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications are enabled on both the lockscreen and the homescreen - and there's an Android-like pull-down Notification center. You can set the behavior for each app's notifications: view in Notifications Center on/off, view on Lock Screen on/off, Badge icon on/off, number of shown items 1/5/10 and alert style - off/banner/pop-up alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system is pretty flexible and configurable now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications on the lockscreen are displayed only as long as you unlock the phone. The next time you lock it, they are all gone even if you haven?t checked them up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To access an event from the lockscreen, just slide its icon left-to-right just as you would unlock the phone. Simple as that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications on the homescreen or any running app can be displayed in two ways - as a banner at the top of the screen or as a pop-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification banner at the top stays for a few seconds and then disappears. If you tap on it you will be taken to the relevant app. The pop-up alert works the same way: it appears at the center of the screen and has two buttons - View and Dismiss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the pull-down Notification Center works just like the notifications in Android. You can access the Notification Center from anywhere in the interface. It does pause the app below, so there?s no chance that you crash your car in Real Racing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center displays all your pending alerts. You can enable/disable and rearrange the alerts from the Notification settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center supports widgets too. Currently there are only two - Weather and Stocks - but we expect more to come in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more things we need to mention related to the general interface. The first one is the dedicated Camera shortcut on the lockscreen. You can bring it up the same way you invoke the music controls - with a double click of the Home button. The camera key appears right next to the Unlock slider and will launch the Camera app when tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing is the Newsstand app on your homescreen, which displays as a homescreen folder. All the periodicals you buy at the App Store will go there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Multi-tasking gestures work only on the iPad family<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much has been said about the iOS multi-touch gestures since the first iOS 4.3 beta came out. Basically, their purpose is to help you navigate through the UI without using the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between the active apps using horizontal four (or five)-finger swipes. A similar upward swipe will bring you the task switcher. There's a four (or five if it feels more natural) finger pinch zoom out. It will bring you to the homescreen, sending the app to the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those gestures will only be available in the tablet version of the iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zoom out and the horizontal swipes work everywhere but the homescreen, while the swipe up gesture is available across the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video demo of how they work (note that the video shows iPad 2 running iOS 4.3 with activated multi-touch gestures, but they work exactly the same on the iOS 5):</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four fingers are just too much perhaps on the 3.5-inch iPhone screen - in case you wonder why those gestures are available only on the iPad. It would have been nice of Apple to have included them as an option anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessage service - free text and multimedia messages across iOS devices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is another useful thing to premiere with the iOS 5 - the iMessage service, which is integrated into the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5-running iGadgets via Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To activate the iMessage you just need to go to Settings-&gt;Messages and turn it on. But, how it works?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You tap on the new message button and you'll see the standard message composer with a green SEND key. When you choose a recipient you'll notice a small loading icon right next to the name. If the person you are texting has the iMessage service, your SEND key will turn blue and the top bar will say New iMessage instead of New Message. Yes, it?s all automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service is essentially an IM - in an iMessage conversation you can see when the other person is typing and you get their messages instantly. You can also get Read Receipts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing about iMessage - your ID is either your phone number or your email - just as in FaceTime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony - same old phonebook, new sound alerts, FaceTime email identification<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has seen almost no changes and there is still no smart dialing in the dialer (you have the system wide Spotlight search for that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new thing is the several new social-network-related fields when creating or editing a contact ? you get Facebook ID , Flickr ID, LinkedIn ID and a MySpace ID. When you save the person?s service ID in the field, clicking it later on will take you straight to the person?s profile. The feature doesn?t work so well right now at it only allows to enter the details one after the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new field subset in the phonebook is the Related people field. It let?s you add labels such as mother, father, parent, brother, sister, child, friend, spouse, partner, assistant, manager and other though at this beta stag, it doesn?t allow you to pick the specific persons from your contact list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other new thing about the telephony on iOS is that finally, the mail, voicemail and calendar sound alerts are customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime on the iPhone also gets a new feature. If your carrier does not support FaceTime, you could still activate it with your email as ID. It's done automatically if the activation with phone number fails. Just make sure you are connected to a Wi-Fi network and turn the FaceTime on from Settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New Mail app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mail app used to take a lot of stick but most of the missing features have finally made it into the iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open your Inbox and hit the Edit button, you now have a Mark key alongside Move and Delete. You can now mass mark emails as read/unread or flag them as important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple also added Bold, Italic and Underline font styles to the text editing options as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold&amp;select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the font size of the text you're quoting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add or delete Mail folders now - just hit the Edit button when you explore the email account.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social network integration has been a long-requested feature on iOS devices, but why limit it to Twitter only? Well, we may have a few theories as to why Facebook is missing from this list. Now about that Twitter integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a separate Twitter tab in Settings. You can sync your Twitter contacts to the phonebook or you can search your existing contacts for matching Twitter ID?s. Another addition is a Tweet option in the Share menus across the UI (Maps, YouTube, Safari, etc.) next to Email, Print, MMS, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are we the only ones that find this popup way too big already? Just kidding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage multiple Twitter accounts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The new camera app - grid, swipe for gallery, pinch to zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Camera app has been enhanced with a viewfinder grid, an HDR setting, pinching gesture for digital zoom, a new excuse for the lack of a proper hardware shutter key and swipe gesture for quick gallery access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All fine and dandy - but making the volume key double as a camera key is more like guerilla tactics used by third-party hacks to make up for the missing hardware feature. But when a manufacturer himself resorts to a rather makeshift solution as this hack, it does little good - other than the fact that they own up to a mistake. Secondly, we still remember Apple banning a certain Camera app for enabling this function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing we found that Apple didn't give enough credit in their elaborate presentation is that a swipe to the right on the camera viewfinder opens the last picture taken. A swipe to the left in turn brings back the camera's live view instantly. Perhaps the reason for laying low on this one is it?s an honest rip-off from the Windows Phone 7 camera app. Still, it?s one neat feature and we love it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia changes - separate Video app, Music app replaces iPod, integrated photo editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 5 has finally given the iPhone a dedicated Video app and removed the video section from the iPod player. The Video app is the same as on the iPad. As of iOS 5, you are now able to sync and play 1080p videos to the default video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the iPod player, this is no longer its name. The music player is now simply called Music and has a new icon. As it no longer handles video, the renaming makes sense. There are no other changes - visual or functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has a new nifty feature - a photo editor. It enables rotation, cropping, and red-eye removal. There's also an option called Enhance over which you have no control - it's all automatic. In Edit mode four keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reminders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has included a brand new app with the new iOS 5 - Reminders. It?s as simple as it name suggests it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders app has pretty simple interface doing really some basic but important stuff. There are two viewing options - by date or a list. Both of them start with a Completed list as a first pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the List view you have the option to add different lists - the default one is the events on your phone. But you can add list for iCloud or Gmail reminders for example. All lists appear as different panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have chosen the List view, you have to work with only 2 panes - the Completed list and one pane for all of your reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing by date gives you lots of panes - you start with Completed and then you have one pane for each day. You also get a Calendar shortcut, where you can choose easily the day you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you choose to create a new reminder, first you must type its name directly on the pane and click Done. After that you are able to edit (just tap on it) - you can choose the Type of reminder - by date or location, Due option, Priority and to which list it will belong (iPhone, iCloud, Gmail etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to be reminded on the day of the event, you just choose date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novel feature is the location-aware reminder triggering option. You can choose a location from your phonebook or your current location (why not Gmaps, it beats us!) and then you choose whether you like the reminder to activate on on arrival or departure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a reminder activates, you see it as a standard notification - on your lockscreen, the Notification Center and the homescreen (as a banner or a pop-up).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Safari and Safari Reader<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has updated the Safari browser too, both the iPhone/iPod Touch and the iPad's. It promises better performance but we can?t judge this by this beta release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few new handy features - Tabbed Browsing for the iPad, a Private Browsing option for all iOS devices and the Reader mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPads are finally getting tabs in the browser. It was a long awaited feature that took Apple three iterations of iOS to implement. Still, better late than never, we guess. It works as it's supposed to and you no longer need to go through the Pages View to jump on another already opened page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All iGadgets have a Private Browsing option in the Safari settings (Settings-&gt;Safari). If you turn it on, nothing you do on the bowser will leave a trail in your phone - no browsing history, no search history, no usernames or passwords, etc. The only thing nicer than the Private Browsing itself would have been if this was implemented as a dedicated key within the Safari's UI, instead of a lonely toggle in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now let's talk about the best part so far - the integrated Reader. If a page is compatible with the Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get the new Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. If you activate it, you'll get a clean view of the article you are reading - only text and the article-related pictures. There are no ads, no navigation controls, nothing beyond the important stuff. And best of all, getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you get to the end of the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two font controls at the top. You can also select a word and choose Define - the iOS 5 integrated Dictionary will open with the meaning of the word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open a multi-page article (like this preview) the Reader will detect it and will load the next page when you reach the bottom of the current.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also make bookmarks of Reader pages - they are added into the Reader List for later reading. Note that the page is not saved for offline access, it's just a bookmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video for you to enjoy:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Storage management and App Store purchase list<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next two features became favorites of those of you who use 16GB iPhones - Storage management and Purchased list within the App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find the Purchased list in App Store's section Updates. It has two tabs - All and Not On This iPhone. It's the easiest way to download again an app you've purchased before and later deleted it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this list became available on the iOS 4 a few minutes after the iOS 5 announcement was over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the Storage Management. You can find it in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Usage menu. Here you now have storage information too, before the Battery Percentage toggle and the statistics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storage part begins with Free and Used space info and then you have a list with your ten biggest apps and their memory footprint - usually the Music and some heavy games such as Infinity Blade. You can access all of yours installed app via the dedicated button at the end of the top 10 list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you tap on an app from this list you will be able to delete its data (saves, etc.) or uninstall the whole app. Here you can see what the memory footprint of the app is and its internal data size created after the installation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those of you which are always troubled by low memory storage, those options should be quite helpful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wireless activation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps this is the part Apple put most effort in. Many are probably put off by the dependence on iTunes. Well, Apple has finally made this a lot easier..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer to activate your iGadget. The moment you turn on your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch for the first time, you can do the activation and setup process right from your device (a network connection is required of course). After a few simple steps, quite similar to Android's initiation process, you are good to go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OTA updates<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer connection and iTunes to install new firmware updates either. Now you can do it over-the-air. The option is in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Software Update. Of course, you can still use iTunes on your Mac/PC to do that if your Wi-Fi connection is too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And thanks to the use of Delta encoding, the updates will now come with a much smaller footprint than before when they carried a whole system image. The new update files will carry only the bits that need changing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi iTunes sync<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case you choose to rely on the traditional computer dependent iTunes sync, you will be happy to know Apple is working to add an option to sync wirelessly. The only requirement is your iGadget and your PC/Mac are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with Windows Phone 7, the wireless wync can be set to run automatically as soon as you plug your device to charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This feature is currently unavailable in this iOS 5 beta, so we can?t share the experience with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new about the PC/Mac iTunes sync, is that it no longer locks your device during the process. You can continue to use your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch during the sync process, but you might experience some lag (at least in the beta). Still it's a real improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the connectivity has been vastly improved. If you choose to use the iCloud, the only one thing that you may ever need the desktop iTunes is for using the USB mass storage functionality. We hope someday Apple does this more natural.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accessibility<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has added a few new accessibility options that may be helpful even for those who are not actualy disabled. The iPhone may now use the LED flash for alerts and you can assign and even create custom vibration patterns to specific alert events or contacts ? much like you would assign a personalized ringtone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, let's pay due attention to the iCloud. What is it, how you set it up and what you get?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud is Apple's cloud-based content management - the service, which comes free with iOS 5 will further reduce the need of a PC/Mac and iTunes. Effortless syncing and backup/restore - along with pushing content to all devices associated with your Apple ID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps on iCloud</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until now you synced all your apps with a single computer and its iTunes. If you had more than one iDevice you've done two (or more) separate sync processes. Well, this is no more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the new Purchased list already in the App Store's Update tab. Now Apple knows exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple knows this for each one of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 50KB. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPHone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 50KB file too - a lot more natural process to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then the whole content will backed up (have that in mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts, Calendar, iBooks, Photos and Documents on iCloud</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iCloud is capable of syncing all your contacts, calendar events, books, photos and documents. The content will become available on all of yours iDevices automagically. The iCloud stores new photos automatically for 30 days, enough time to connect your other iGadgets so they can get the photos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud free email</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud offers a free me.com email that will also sync automatically across all your iDevices. You will be offered this when you activate the iCloud for the first time and the setup process is done in one easy step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud Music</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own (ripped music, etc.) that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple cannot backup that music offers the iTunes Match service exactly for that reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased from iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets - it will sync the same way the other content syncs. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection and sees if your songs match to songs in the Apple's iTunes Store (currently 18+ million songs and growing). If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, you will need to use the standard computer depended sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the iTunes scans yours songs and push them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your songs are with lower quality than 256Kbps, the iTunes will download the song with better quality (256Kbps). The iMatch service costs $25 per year and seems unique in the music store world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud Backup/Restore</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can back up your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch with the iCloud. It will store all of your settings and other important stuff, so if you need to restore wirelessly (if you got a new device for example) - it's the easiest way. The backup is automatic and is done once a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5GB free storage</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple gives you 5GB free storage for iCloud sync. Now this may sound not enough for you, but actually it's more than enough. Your purchased music, apps and books don't count in this storage (except the app's personal data such as saves, settings, etc.). So the things that eat that storage are app's data, contacts, mail, photos, calendar events, backups and personal documents. Of course, there is an option to buy more iCloud storage, but Apple is yet to announce the storage plans this fall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a demo video for various iOS 5 settings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It looks like lots of little tweaks but combined they do make a difference. And this is a BETA version for developers to optimize their apps. Come September, there will probably be more new stuff to talk about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, many of the updates we covered here have been already available in the App Store by third-party contributions. Apple copied a thing or two from other platforms too, like Android and WP7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all depends what your priorities are, of course, but to us it seems the iOS 4 had more weight as an update. But then - it came on an awesome new phone, which kind of stole the spotlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It looks like the iOS 5 will be filling the blanks and connecting the dots. And it's not a job to be ashamed of. The updates show enough promise and we wouldn't mind getting surprised in September either.</paragraph>
