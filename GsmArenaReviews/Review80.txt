			<paragraph>It was handsets like the original Chocolate that put LG on the map. But simply playing with the big boys was never going to be enough. It takes creativity to outsmart and outdo some formidable rivals. LG never shied away from experimenting and have been repaid more often than not. There?s Black Label and Prada, some great cameraphones and a host of capable touchscreen devices to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that was then. The New Chocolate is new and it means it. The ?Black Label? simply sticks on the BL40 but this phone seems to hold a higher purpose. It?s not merely the next of the Chocolates ? it?s in touch with its times. And it does great justice to a portfolio where Viewty Smart talks to Renoir and Crystal walks with the Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40, the New Chocolate, is thin, classy and sexy but the one word that does it justice is unique. You really won?t find another phone like it out there, and only a few others have the same kind of impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won?t see a designer or watchmaker?s signature on the BL40 but it definitely looks like an exquisite work of art. However, neither its price tag nor its feature set will let you think of it that way. We don?t mean it?s cheap or even affordable to many, but its all round skill puts most of the boutique handsets to shame. There are only few things the New Chocolate can?t do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike some other fashionable handsets out there, the LG BL40 New Chocolate beauty is not just skin deep. This stunning looker has all the hardware a modern high-end gadget should have. And though technically not a smartphone, the New Chocolate?s S-class user interface offers convenient multitasking and is polished to match the sleek exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate comes with a brilliant 16M-color capacitive touchscreen enabled for multi-touch input. It also sports TV-out, Dolby mobile, FM transmitter and DixX/XviD support out of the box. All this sounds a promise for an unmatched multimedia experience. The New Chocolate display has the 21:9 aspect ratio of cinema screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we are just touching the surface of the spec sheet. Next up are the 5 megapixel autofocus camera and the full range of connectivity options, followed by the useful task manager. So, it's got the looks and it's got the brains. Will its extravagance bring it to the top or make it a flop?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we delve into the colorful S-Class UI of the LG BL40 New Chocolate and start revealing its features, we?ll spin it for you and share our impressions of the design and ergonomics. Prepare for the jump!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG BL40 New Chocolate 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no phone like the New Chocolate out there. It?s easier said than done these days, and LG do deserve credit. What makes it stand out are the unique proportions but that doesn?t necessarily mean that tall is the new slim. Handling and overall feel are hard to get right on such a handset. It?s a fine line, and we can safely say LG didn?t cross it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the bar form factor is hardly revolutionary, the LG BL40 New Chocolate silhouette leaves quite an impression. The LG BL40 New Chocolate measures 128 x 51 x 10.9 mm and weighs a good 129 grams. Those numbers may sound scary at first (especially the height) but with the time you get used to the unusual size of the phone. And believe us, the impact it makes is worth a couple of inconveniences.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate rides heavily on the piano black gloss of the original. The thin metallic lines on the sides and the Ferrari red accents on the top and bottom add another touch of class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the shape, well, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but then it was never meant to be. One thing's for sure: if you want to be noticed, very few phones will do it for you better than the New Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few hardware buttons on the LG BL40 New Chocolate make a nice job of blending in with the seamless styling of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece (which doubles as a loudspeaker), the video-call camera, proximity and ambient light sensors. It does sound crowded but in fact all those things are hardly noticeable against the classy black finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the LG BL40 New Chocolate has a single key which opens the music player. The microUSB port is on this side as well, and it's got the same latch cover as the LG Crystal - it's probably the most convenient microUSB cover introduced by any handset manufacturer so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BL40 New Chocolate accommodates the volume rocker and the shutter key. While the other side keys are as thin as the ornamental silver frame, the shutter key is wider and rounded, and quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock key. Both are easy to access and nice to use. The Power/Lock button is a little more prominent than the other hardware keys but it's also probably the most used physical button. Since there aren?t any hardware call buttons on the front we thought it could?ve made sense for the Power/Lock button to reject incoming calls. It turns out though that using the on-screen controls is actually the only way to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The red bottom looks like a mirror image of the top - good symmetry and nice contrast. At times you may find yourself wondering which way is up. All you get at the bottom is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back follows the same "less is more" mantra as the front. The 5-megapixel camera lens is here alongside the LED flash and a hole for an extra microphone - this allows the BL40 New Chocolate to record better audio for your video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rather conspicuous logo testifies for the Schneider-Kreuznach certification . There's nothing to protect the lens from scratches though so you'll need to be careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover comes off easily in a slide to open fashion. It holds firmly though, no wobbles or creaks. Underneath is a 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery, the SIM card compartment and the microSD card slot. A side-accessible card slot would?ve spoiled the seamless look of the handset really, so we guess the compromise is not too big. The card is still hot-swappable. The LG BL40 New Chocolate handled a 16GB microSDHC card trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is quoted at 400 hours of standby and up to 6 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that glossy plastic on the back however comes at a price. There isn't a fingerprint that it won't catch and the screen isn't any better. Out in the sun, the New Chocolate often looks a smudgy mess. Make sure you take the time to wipe the phone clean - this is a handset that needs to always look its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate feels heavy in the hand but not unpleasantly so. It will take you some time to find a convenient hand-hold position in which the four corners of the screen are within your thumb's reach and the head-heavy phone doesn?t risk slipping off your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the peculiar shape does take its toll but the impression the phone makes and the exclusive feel are well worth it. It?s an elaborate piece of equipment that looks absolutely sharp and makes sense. By the way, the unusual shape and size surprisingly make the phone extra comfortable to hold during phone calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies love the Chocolate screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With touchscreen bars, the front is usually dominated by the screen, but "dominated" is nothing short of an understatement here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of course the centerpiece of the entire phone. While a 21:9 aspect ratio is common in cinema and relatively rare in TVs, in mobile phones it's one of a kind. And along with the regular functionality, the BL40 New Chocolate capacitive screen also offers multi-touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 21:9 aspect ratio is great in PMP terms but the 4? display is a real treat all around. The touch sensitivity is top-notch, the handset responds to even the lightest taps. And the sunlight legibility, which has been a problem of earlier LG handsets, is a great surprise. The screen has probably gotten some new sort of finish that improves things tremendously. Not least, the precious piece of hardware is well protected against scratches with its tempered glass coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate may not be iPhone-good in direct sunlight, but it's close. Not to mention it has quite a few more pixels on the screen than the iPhone. The colors are vibrant - the picture quality makes watching videos and browsing photos a nice experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Widescreen S-Class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class UI has already made a name as one of the major mobile platforms today. Since the first S-Class device - the LG KM900 Arena - the next implementations in the Viewty Smart and the Crystal did not bring any significant visual or functional updates. The New Chocolate though promises to change that and take full advantage of the 4" super wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have got it just right and the visuals of the S-class interface are spectacular - everything from homescreen to dropdown menus rolls, sweeps in, unfolds and rotates extra smoothly with a responsiveness that suggests some powerful graphic acceleration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lifting the curtain</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has also been changed and we like it much more this time. Slide to Unlock is what you get on the iPhone and on the Android bunch but the New Chocolate throws that in a upwards direction. You press at the bottom and lift the lockscreen up and it reveals the homescreen as a curtain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite conveniently, the lockscreen notifies of recent events too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate S-Class boasts lockscreen gestures too - similar to Samsung's Smart Unlock. Touch gestures are more of a gimmick really, but some may find it a cool enough. There are nine fixed applications you can assign touch gestures to for a quick start from the lockscreen - contacts, call history, alarms, messaging, email, gallery, FM radio, organizer and memos. There are 12 predefined gesture patterns to choose from too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting that Cube spinning</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cube interface is still the base of the whole setup though technically it's not a Cube anymore. The four homescreen panes correspond to the four sides of a tall 3D block as an actual cube would've looked tiny on this 21:9 widescreen. For the purpose of this review, we'll continue to refer to that interface as the Cube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of the Cube sides hosts the Widget homescreen. It offers a bunch of widgets we've seen on previous LG handsets - there's a notification widget, an analog clock, calendar, world time, WeatherBug, games shortcut, FM radio widget, memo, cell info and a calculator. As you might expect, with the larger screen, there's now more real estate for widgets and shortcuts. Unfortunately, you can't download new widgets. That is the main disadvantage compared to the competing Samsung TouchWiz interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up on the Cube, LG have swapped the rather impractical Multimedia homescreen with a new Browser one. There you can bookmark your favorite web pages just as you can on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third Cube wall accommodates the Contact homescreen, which displays your favorite contacts on a rotating reel and offer quick access to SMS/call options. All numbers and emails are easily available, and users get one-touch access to voice and video calls, and editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Shortcut homescreen offers free space for shortcuts to various apps. We admit that the wonderful main menu is somewhat overcrowded, so the shortcuts homescreen seems quite practical for your everyday needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Status bar at the top of the screen launches a semitransparent menu that can be used to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, change profiles and view recent events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some new stuff as well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time around, the task manager is a little bit more user-friendly and quite resembles the one in Symbian S60 smartphone OS. You press the button, and a pop-up appears to display the currently running apps, so you can terminate or switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-negotiable homescreen wallpapers have been fixed as well, sort of. In the Screen Settings menu you'll find various options to set background images. And while you can enable or disable the wallpaper for each of the four homescreens, you cannot pick different wallpaper images for the individuals screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting to the essence</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG New Chocolate main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. It has the typical layout of four side-scrollable rows of menu items. In this flat structure, all menu items are accessible simultaneously without jumping tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you turn the phone sideways, the landscape menu will fit all icons on screen with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The New Chocolate's menu icons have a bit of 3D-styling with some visual effects, but you can also use the old 2D menu if you so prefer. The alternative 2D theme is the black and white Prada 2 variety and we like it better at times. The 3D menu just looks too busy with color - but it's definitely the flashier one demonstrating the vibrant AMOLED color capabilities.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Kinetic scrolling for a sweeter phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class has an attractive and thumbable phonebook. The Contact list has tiny separators with the corresponding alphabetical letter. The phonebook displays every contact with a picture, name and a green call button for quick dial. Tapping on a contact will take you to a next screen with details and Call/Text buttons. The option to locally expand the contact info straight in the contact list is not available this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The novelty on the contact's detail screen is recent history - all calls, messages and emails to and from this contact can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of the interface on the GC900 Viewty Smart, the phonebook is highly touch-optimized. Scrolling is kinetic or as it has been called lately - it's the flick scrolling type that comes with inertia and only needs a flick of your finger to start rolling. It's fluid enough with only occasional motion jerks so, it's the best we've seen so far from LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there is a search option and it's available on top of your contact list. The good thing is it's now visible at all times regardless of your position in the phonebook. This is quite handy and LG have done well to take advantage of the bigger screen . None of the previous S-Class powered handsets, or even the iPhone, have that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users no longer have the option to place a specific contact on the contact homescreen by tapping the small star button. The star is still there but only to indicate your favorite contacts. The adding of contacts to the favorite homescreen is now easily available from the homescreen itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The telephony tastes excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate handles phone calls flawlessly, as you have every right to expect. The phone dialer works with an on-screen standard numpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The green history shortcut is available on the dial pad and takes you to the call log. It turns into a green receiver key as soon as you punch some numbers. You can also access the call history from the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred it if there was an easier way of getting to the call history. Your recent contacts are probably the ones that you call most frequently so having a quick access to them (such as a hardware key, for instance) would have been much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rejecting and receiving calls are also two operations that are in dire need of their own hardware keys. If not for anything else, the Off key would have been quite comfortable for muting and subsequently rejecting an incoming call. Now your only tolls to do that are the sliders on the screen itself - which, believe it or not, are not that easily recognizable in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is of course available but it's a disappointment more than anything else. The Smart Dial implementation on the New Chocolate only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you've typed in the dialer. This just isn't of much help since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they got their names. Plus searching in the recent calls history is also a nice suggestion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate scored a Very Good mark in our loudspeaker performance test. Here is how it stacks up against some of the other handsets we've put through it. More info on our test is available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Candied messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two major sections in the main menu - Messaging and Email. The LG BL40 New Chocolate supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages are neatly organized in a standard list view and sorted by date. You can choose a filter - SMS, MMS or notifications. Naturally, the Inbox is the default location when you enter the Messaging menu, but you can change it to Outbox, Sent, Drafts or My Folders. There is also a threaded view option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type on the standard alphanumeric keypad or flip the BL40 landscape and enjoy the huge - and we mean it - QWERTY keyboard. There is touch feedback either way, and typing is very accurate. This time though the QWERTY keys are big enough and it is much harder to tap the wrong key. Each symbol you tap is clearly marked by iPhone-style pop-ups. The huge screen has allowed for larger Favorites and Contacts shortcuts on the SMS screen, which have replaced the small square buttons from the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, set up on the LG BL40 New Chocolate is hassle-free. Adding an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever set-up scheme. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make better use of the unusual screen aspect ratio, the email client has a completely new look. In portrait orientation it's the same as in the older S-Class version, but turning the BL40 New Chocolate to landscape mode reveals a much more comfortable interface. The message headers are sorted in a column on the left side of the screen, while a preview pane on the right lets you read the selected email. This type of UI resembles standard desktop email clients such as Outlook or Thunderbird and we are sure it will be heartily welcomed by those looking for PC-like experience on their phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 2.2MB, double the 1MB limit of the previous S-Class phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but you can still save those to the phone memory when you receive them. You can open and preview MS Office and PDF attachments directly inside the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for setting multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the messaging part of the LG BL40 New Chocolate has nothing to offer in the social networking department. It's actually quite strange, as cheaper LG phones such as the LG Pop and LG GW520 have push social networking right out of the box.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full featured multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate comes with 1GB of onboard storage, expandable via the microSD memory card slot. The LG BL40 file manager appears as the My Stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders, but you can store whatever content you like in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast, even when the memory card has loads of images on (800+ in our case).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate offers two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid sorted by date, type or name, while in landscape mode you get a nice spatial view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape 3D gallery has been changed as opposed to the LG Arena. While in the original S-class interface you only had three images visible at a time here they are a lot more with options to change the viewing angle and zoom level. While we really appreciate the UI designers effort, we somehow find the new layout messy and really not practical. Performance-wise it's really ok - it's as fluid as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the multi-touch enabled capacitive touchscreen, you can zoom in on images with the pinching gesture that you may have seen on the iPhone or the HTC Hero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opened images also rotate automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the standard options in the standard gallery such as rename, delete, print, send and info, there is also a slideshow mode. You can choose the time interval and the display order (shuffle or not). The nice transition effects are random, we couldn't find a dedicated option for choosing a specific one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG New Chocolate music player is accessible from the main menu or through the dedicated key on the side of the phone. You can sort tracks by artist, album, genre and rating. The current track's album art, name, album and artist are expandable in the actual track list, the next and previous tracks still visible at the top and bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a huge Shuffle button on the top of the playlist, which is quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the music player automatically switches its orientation from/to landscape mode when you rotate the phone. As you may suspect there is a new look here too: small virtual vinyls are lined up on a rotating dial to display the available albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of equalizer presets (all non-customizable, though) and among them one managed to impress us. It's the highly promoted Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement making the sound richer and more spacious. With all the presets available we're sure you'll find one to suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ready for widescreen action</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the music player hasn't changed much since the Arena or the Crystal, the video player has had a complete overhaul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to codec support, we came across an apparent inconsistency. The pre-release unit with very early firmware that we previewed managed to play all the DivX movies we threw at it (including 720p HD video), while XviD video was more of a hit-and-miss affair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This retail unit in turn refused to handle any HD video or anything higher than D1 resolution. Also, there seem to be an additional software limitation imposed regarding the video bitrate. So having the right resolution is not a guarantee for success. Videos of higher bitrates don't play at all - and we're talking clips that ran just fine on the earlier sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, most of the DivX/XviD movies at or below D1 resolution were played just fine, no drops and lags. We particularly liked the 21:9 ones that matched the screen ratio and looked awesome. We definitely recommend you find a few and try them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a quick shortcut to the TV-out settings if you want to play the videos on a bigger screen using the TV-out functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting feature is the chapter selection. If your video has been divided into chapters, they will appear as small thumbs at the bottom of the player screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dolby Mobile is available on the video player but it's turned off by default. And just so you know, its effect is best appreciated on the headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also has an option to capture frames from the currently playing video or even edit the whole movie. The editor has some features like trimming or video merge, live or custom audio dubbing, add text or image overlay or add a dimming effect. We guess most of those will be best used on videos captured by the LG BL40 itself than on actual movies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>FM radio and FM transmitter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 comes with an FM radio that can play on both the headphones and the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the headphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 60 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS. Scrolling stations is very easy and intuitive - you have quick access through the two rows of buttons below the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the FM radio is running in the background you can control it using the homescreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice addition to the LG BL40 New Chocolate feature list is the in-built FM transmitter, allowing you to broadcast the currently playing track to any standard FM radio receiver (e.g. car audio or home stereo). The FM transmitting range is somewhat limited much like on the LG Arena and if you've got your car antenna at the back (such as on the trunk) you might have issues in receiving clear signal up in front. But your mileage will probably vary depending on the strength of your receiver FM tuner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally stereo Bluetooth is also supported, so you can enjoy your music on wireless earphones. If you don't like the headset that comes in the retail package, you can easily change it for another thanks to the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality fares decently<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate has pretty decent audio quality, achieving noteworthy scores on some of the readings in our traditional audio quality test. The handset is only a tad worse than the LG KM900 Arena as you can see from the table below, but that kind of differences are intangible in real-life scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only notable problem with the New Chocolate audio output is that it has cut-off bass frequencies, probably due to some kind of high-pass filter meant to improve sound on small size headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the LG BL40 has decent intermodulation distortion and oustanding dynamic range, noise level and low stereo crosstalk readings. The total harmonic distortion is also kept well under control. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG BL40 New Chocolate frequency response compared to Apple iPhone 3GS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No Wi-Fi video streaming tastes bitter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate comes with YouTube integration and you can upload videos to YouTube directly from the handset. Bear in mind that the option is available only in the video player and not in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the S-Class web browser, as with every other LG phone, doesn't have Flash support, so watching YouTube videos on the desktop version of the web site is a no-go. The only way to watch your favorite videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately and typically, the LG BL40 New Chocolate allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over the EDGE or UMTS connection (even if Wi-Fi is listed as an option, it just doesn't work), so in essence - you cannot watch the streaming mobile YouTube videos over Wi-Fi. A real bummer, we know. The same strange issue plagues the Crystal, Viewty Smart, Arena, Prada 2 and the Renoir. Is it really impossible for LG to add that feature?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since a lot of users don't seem aware of this fact, here's a tip - to watch streaming videos (such as YouTube) you first need to set up the dedicated streaming settings of the phone to use the same internet profile as your mobile web browser. The place you do that is on Settings row&gt;Connectivity&gt; Streaming settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixels of chocolate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate sports a 5 megapixel camera with a Schneider-Kreuznach certified lens and a LED flash. It's capable of taking photos with maximum resolution 2560x1920 and features image stabilization, geo-tagging, face tracking, blink and smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate comes with the revamped camera interface, resembling that on the Viewty Smart. You can access all camera settings via the left taskbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for Scene mode, flash, focus mode (auto/macro), advanced settings and Homescreen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate Advanced settings camera menu is a clever rotating dial (digicam style) with the available options for each setting displayed as a list on the right. The interface is very friendly, neat and usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another bar on the right hand-side of the screen. It offers a virtual shutter key, as well as quit and gallery buttons. This bar is fixed and is not transparent - it's always there to get around the wide aspect ratio of the LG BL40 New Chocolate screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two scroll bars on both sides of the viewfinder - one for zooming and one for the viewfinder brightness adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, about the available settings. First off, there's the standard set of options such as white balance, preset scene modes, self-timer, color effects, image stabilization, ISO and exposure compensation. A dedicated macro mode is available and close-ups usually turn out fine. Unfortunately, neither the scenes menu nor the macro switch is available as shortcuts directly in the viewfinder ? you have to dig for those in the additional specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate has a nice Continuous shooting mode that snaps 6 full-res images and then allows you to review them and pick the keeper(s).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode also deserves attention. The BL40 New Chocolate can take up to twelve shots (of 640 x 480 pixel resolution) that are stitched together automatically. The actual snapping is also automatic and the result is an extremely wide photo with a height of at best 480 pixels. It would have been much nicer if it could produce a panorama photo from three full-res shots, like the LG Renoir, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in GPS you can also get fairly accurate GPS data embedded in your photos. Later on, when you upload them to a geotag-enabled photo sharing service (Flickr or Picasa to name a few) you can show your friends and family where you took them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection and tracking is another hip feature making its way into high-end cameraphones. Unlike digital cameras however, the BL40 can only detect/track one face at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smile detection is a nice add-on to the face detection gadgetry. When smile detection is enabled, it sets the camera in auto shutter mode, so instead of shooting right up when you press the shutter all the way down it waits for a smile on the currently detected face and snaps only when the time is right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tool in the LG ammo is Beauty shot, which we guess many people would welcome. It smoothes skin and enhances skin tones for a better portrait.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG BL40 New Chocolate also offers enhanced color effects that include cooling or warming the scene and adding a nice looking vignette as part of their Art shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Out-of-focus shot mode simulates the background defocusing that DSLR cameras offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now those are things that you can easily replicate with most desktop image editors but if you are among the many people that don't like to waste time with post processing on a computer, now you have a chance to get those shots just as you like them straight in the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 produces nice photos with decent levels of detail and pleasant colors. The noise levels are tolerable, though sometimes they can be a bit higher than usual. In some places there's extreme oversharpening, but it's rare enough and definitely something you can live with. There are aspects that clearly need some more work, but the overall feeling about the image quality remains positive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we can't say the same thing about the video recording. The BL40 video recording is a total disaster. The handset is expected to capture videos with VGA resolution at 30 fps. Instead we got a video coming from a CIF resolution source and almost half of the promised 30 frames are duplicates. You can see the camera samples for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wireless connectivity support is abundant on the LG BL40 New Chocolate. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is on board and so is the HSDPA 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports the two local connectivity standards - Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi options have a simple interface - you choose the desired network, type the pass key and voila - you're connected. Of course, there are plenty of advanced options available for the geeks out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last and most important thing is that every installed Java application, which requires internet access prompts you to choose between UMTS and Wi-Fi, which is a great option. You can have Google Maps running on a Wi-Fi connection, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 Nw Chocolate comes with the standard microUSB port for charging and data transfers. Speaking of data transfers, Mass storage mode is supported so you can use the phone as a removable storage device. That only works for the memory card though - you cannot access the New Chocolate's internal memory in this mode (you have to connect it to LG PC Suite IV to access that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the standard 3.5mm audio jack you can opt for using your favorite pair of headphones with the LG BL40. However, in that case you'll lose the mic, which is embedded on the original set. The LG New Chocolate uses the same type of headphones as the LG Arena (yes, they're white) and those are headphones we're generally quite pleased with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also hook the LG BL40 to an external monitor using an optional TV-out cable in either PAL or NTSC mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A nice web browser, but no Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 web browser is identical to those ones on the previous S-Class devices, except for the screen aspect. Scrolling and panning have been improved a bit and it performs generally more fluid than its older siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the BL40 New Chocolate delivers the legendary 'pinch' zooming. LG have done a good job here but the zooming action is a bit more fluid in the image gallery than it is here. Still it bests the previous S-class phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loading speeds are not particularly enviable though. Over Wi-Fi, the LG BL40 browser takes twice the time to fully load a page than the iPhone 3G (not to mention the 3GS) and you can't really pan around while the page is still loading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls are found at the top of the screen and don't auto-hide. The only option to make them disappear is to turn on the full screen view from the browser menu or flip the phone landscape. Then the accelerometer comes into play and does its job pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful feature is that you can have several pages open at the same time and switch back and forth between them from the Multi-windows option from the menu. The way it's done is identical to the iPhone Safari - in a 3D reel. Saving pages for offline viewing is another thing that you'll probably use quite often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handy browser skill is searching web pages for specific words - the first match gets highlighted and the total number of matches is displayed with up and down buttons to scroll them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A visual enhancement of the plain browsing history list is the option to view snapshots of the pages you've visited. You can flick between the pages and tap to open the one you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. But, as we already pointed out in the video section of this review, you can go for the mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com. Just remember to tweak your streaming settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Brownie bar organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keeping a schedule is an important part of the LG BL40 New Chocolate and it has several applications to help you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice Organizer combines a calendar with monthly and weekly views and a task list. Event alarms can be set to go off up to a week earlier to give you enough time to prepare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing Monday or Sunday as the first day of the week is also an option. You can also mark some days as holidays and override the Alarms set. 'Holidays' are not repeated annually so it's more useful to mark your vacation with them rather than national holidays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A To-Do application lets you keep a list of tasks sorted by their importance. If those reminders aren't enough you can always jot down a Memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 can store up to 500 calendar events, 500 To-Do notes and 100 memos. Making a back up to external memory is just a few clicks away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option in the Organizer menu is the Date Finder. A visually-impressive option is selecting a month through the main calendar view. It opens a nice spinning wheel with two parts where you can choose the appropriate month and year by rotating the wheels. That can't help but ring our iPhone-copycat bell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm functions are typical S-Class. Apart from the default alarm you can create as many alarms as you want. This gives you access to another eye-catching interface - an analog clock where you set the hands at the desired time. There is a digital one for those who prefer it. The other available settings are alarm tone, vibration, and snoozing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you also get a calculator with a new touch-optimized interface and a wide array of functions (basic and advanced mathematical functions), a Unit Converter, a World Clock and a Voice recorder. Voice recordings are not limited in duration and can be sent via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS onboard, LG Wisepilot in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the most popular electronic map software for mobile phones. It comes preinstalled on the LG BL40 New Chocolate and makes use of its built-in GPS receiver. It worked just fine and the version is designed specially for the handset's native resolution and screen aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But more importantly, a full-featured navigation software is finally preloaded: the New Chocolate comes with the Wisepilot for LG. The app is very easy and intuitive to use. Wisepilot takes advantage of all NAVTEQ maps, so it's unlikely you will find anything important missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with every other navigation software, the Wisepilot offers route calculations, specific searches, traffic information, weather, etc. And it has voice assistance of course. You can also log in WisePilot website made especially for LG users and plan your trips on the desktop computer and then transfer them to the cellphone. Bear in mind though, that much like with Google Maps, all the WisePilot map data gets downloaded top your mobile live as you go via the wireless network connection so unless you're on a fixed data plan we suggest you mind your usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the included WisePilot license is only a trial one and in our case it was valid for only a month. That may be subject to change in your region or under your carrier bundle, of course. Generally, a basic 3-month license for full Europe will cost you 25 euro, while a full-year license will set you back some good 70 euro. Extras such as Speed cameras cost another 10 bucks for a year's license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, WisePilot for LG is available for LG Arena and LG Viewty Smart as well, so if you're interested in getting a trial version for those, you can hop on to WisePilot website.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games &amp; Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Picsel viewer handles Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Zooming in and out is done by - you guessed it - pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a useful option to fit the contents in a single column but it only seems to work for doc files. The viewer makes full use of the accelerometer and auto rotates to take advantage of the wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled games on the LG BL40 are all motion-based - Racing Time 2, Dual Match, Music World, Hidden Catch Wide, Real Motion Fishing, Bubble Breeze and Musical Instruments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Racing Time 2 is a standard racing game using the accelerometer to steer the car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual Match is the most interesting game around designed specifically for the BL40 New Chocolate. It has both single and multi-player mode. You have a huge board with elastic balls and your task is to shoot the opponent's balls outside the board. If the game is played by two players, both of them need to be holding the phone at opposite ends. Multiplayer can be a real fun, we admit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's the Music World game where you have to tap some jumping yellow creatures at the right moment in order to reveal a puzzle picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden Catch Wide is a simple game where you need to find the differences between two pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real Motion Fishing is a very simple game only meant to show off the accelerometer functionality. With a flick of the hand you angle the fishing rod and hope some fish will bite. Three attempts to score some points and game over. Simple, easy and pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Bubble Breeze is about making floating soap bubbles by blowing into the phone's microphone. Music Instruments gives you a piano keyboard or a set of drums to compose tunes by tapping on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also five additional demos in the Games section - Asphalt 4, Brain Challenge 2, Bubble Bash and Tetris. We've seen them many times before.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The New Chocolate packs enough skill to make comparison with some powerful smartphones almost inevitable. Now, it's obvious the LG BL40 is not in the same league as the likes of Hero, Omnia HD or Nokia X6 but we guess it will be more than welcome for an all-star friendly. It may sound unthinkable for a self-respecting geek to so much as consider the New Chocolate against any of those smart heavyweights, but the LG BL40 won't put up with being trivially dismissed as just another fashion phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Hero ? Samsung i8910 Omnia HD ? Nokia X6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the New Chocolate is a few things short of a smartphone but style it's got in excess. And that sets it squarely against a completely different kind of competition. The BL40 is a different breed that stands between smart all-in-ones and premium pieces like Nokia's Arte phones and the Erdos. Still, in today's dynamic market there is no shortage of rivals. The New Chocolate is special but it won't hurt to keep an eye on any potential contender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8000 Jet has been available for a few months now and has already won many customers. The new 3D TouchWiz interface may well be a match for the S-Class, especially on such a powerful hardware package as the Jet. The compact design and equally matched feature set (including full DivX/XviD support, full web Flash support, D1 video and an excellent 5MP camera) make the Jet quite a treat. But not really a threat - we doubt it. The Jet has the specs but hardly the charisma.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8000 Jet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been mere weeks since the release of the Sony Ericsson Aino and a lot of people are eager to see what it's got to offer. The Aino comes with limited touchscreen functionality, a slide-out keypad and an 8 megapixel snapper. In addition to the new Sony Ericsson Touch UI, you'll get PSP and PlayStation 3 remote capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Aino</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the New Chocolate is not a regular update. It personifies the evolution of a company. There's an evolutionary chasm between the Old and New Chocolate and LG have been busy bridging it all these years. The LG BL40 is the fourth S-Class handset but the first with an actual upgrade, and it just about does everything we wanted from the S-Class in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unique design and one of a kind display bring a whole new experience, distinguishing the BL40 from the rest of the mobiles out there. The New Chocolate packs all the company's high-tech knowledge and has the style to compete in the premium segment. It's technologically compelling and aesthetically bold. Premium handsets are niche products but the New Chocolate is not afraid to act as one. In the premium niche nothing is too much and the BL40 is keen to take advantage. Pushing eccentricity and specs through the roof.</paragraph>
