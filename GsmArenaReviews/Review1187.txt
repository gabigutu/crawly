			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The question this second-generation Samsung tablet is trying to answer is not "How much better can it get?" The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 stops at how much. It feels safe pretending there's no such thing as a third-generation iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under different circumstances, the second-generation Galaxy Tab 10.1 would've been a disappointment. It still is, in a way - especially if you expected a substantial upgrade of the original. This duty however falls on another member of the Samsung tablet lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10-inch Note is the one with the better specs and the S Pen adds an extra dimension to the tablet experience. And it certainly needs every bit of muscle and brains to stand up to the iPad 3. The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 has the seemingly easier job to compete with a discounted iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a second thought, although not as much as everyone may've hoped, the actual upgrades over the original manage to make a difference. The voice-call support and the memory-card slot are most welcome. And of course, it comes with Ice Cream Sandwich right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have not one but two tablets to inherit the original 10" Galaxy Tab. Two tablets to challenge Apple and their iPads. Two options for users to choose between. Essentially, it's a choice between the special and the second-best, the exciting and the affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking the gloomy view, the second-gen Galaxy Tab 10.1 isn't good enough for the slim profile, the Exynos chipset and the fullHD videos of the Note. Not to mention the game-changing S Pen. For those who look on the bright side, it's an affordable ten-incher with the latest Android and better specs than the iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hopefully, this review will help you know where you stand. We're back with the design and build right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 looks a lot like the Galaxy Note 10.1, which we recently previewed. The only way to tell them apart is the LED flash and the darker finish of the Note's rear. The Note is also a tad slimmer but the difference of less than a millimeter is negligible on a 10" slab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is built around a 10.1" PLS LCD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. The resolution is only average by today's standarts - the iPad 3 and the Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD have raised the bar too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is quite decent though - viewing angles are very good (although there's a noticeable blue tint when viewed at an angle) and the blacks look reasonably deep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixel density is nothing exciting (149ppi), but big tablets like the Tab 2 10.1 are supposed to be viewed from a greater distance than phones. And no, it's obviously no match for the Retina display, but as we said, it's not supposed to compete with it to begin with. The iPad 2's XGA screen has 132 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 has no hardware controls at the front - it doesn't need any with Ice Cream Sandwich inside. All you get here is the front VGA camera and some sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no earpiece but the tablet can be used as a phone in either loudspeaker mode or with a headset (wired or wireless). That's one of the improvements over the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two speakers are on either side of the screen. You have to be careful not to cover them with your thumbs when you hold the tablet landscape. The speakers aren't as powerful as the grille size may suggest but the front-facing position is better than having them on the sides as in the first Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack along with the SIM compartment and microSD slot, both covered with plastic lids. There's also the Power/Lock button next to the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone is at the bottom and you are warned upon launch of the camcorder app against covering it with a hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 uses a proprietary 30-pin connector for charging and connectivity, which is located at the bottom of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is the 3.15 MP camera lens. There's no LED flash this time round. The original Tab 10.1 has one and so does the 10-inch Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is powered by a non-replaceable 7000 mAh Li-Ion battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of soft plastic, which is nice to the touch and offers decent grip. It's matte too, so it hides fingerprints very well. As you would imagine, you can't pop this cover open to access the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 can actually be held in one hand but we don't think of too many scenarios when you'll have to. That's something for the Note tablet to worry about with the S Pen occupying your other hand. Anyway, the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is reasonably portable and comfortable to handle. It's not as slim as the original or the Note tablet but the increased thickness seems to actually make it easier to hold. It's a solidly built tablet too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: ICS in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is about to start shipping with Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich right out of the box. As usual it is skinned with the proprietary TouchWiz UI, which adds more customizations to the interface than its Honeycomb counterpart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Android navigation keys are in the bottom left corner of the homescreen: Back, Home and Task switcher (plus a screenshot key courtesy of TouchWiz). The search shortcut is in the top left, the app drawer in the top right and finally, but certainly not least importantly, the notification area with quick toggles in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch gesture familiar from TouchWiz phones lets you add, delete and rearrange homescreens easily. The same pinch gesture can be used in the app drawer to again let you rearrange pages. You can't delete or add new pages this way though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar at the bottom has an arrow that flips up a row of what Samsung calls Mini Apps. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 had them too, so they're not new, but they're still fairly unique in the Android world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mini Apps are small, independent windows that always overlay everything else - homescreens, regular full-screen apps, anything. You can fit two or three of those on the large 10.1" screen and they really improve the multitasking abilities of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available Mini Apps include a dialer, messaging, email, calculator, music player, S Memo, even a task manager. If you're not using some of those apps, you can always choose to hide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each Mini App has a button in the top left that launches the corresponding full-featured app and a close button in the top right. Such overlaid windows have been a staple of desktop OSes, but they feel a little odd in Android at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has the connectivity toggles that we've come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock ICS quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu. The rest of the toggles are Notifications, Sound, Auto-rotation and Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app drawer button stays in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 comes with plenty of preinstalled apps that cannot be found on other tablets - Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office, Video player and My files. Some of the other apps like the music player and the calendar have been modified as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the traditional Android benchmarks on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 (powered by the TI OMAP 4430 SoC, featuring a 1GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 and a PowerVR SGX540 GPU). The processing power is hardly the best around, but is more than decent for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 comes with about the same CPU performance as the other Galaxy Tabs we've tested recently, but the PowerVR SGX540 GPU is less-capable than the Mali-400MP in the Exynos chipset. It holds its ground quite well against the ULP Nvdia GeForce inside the Tegra 3, though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there's not much difference in terms of pure performance between the slates running Android Honeycomb and the ICS-packing Tab 2 10.1. However, that's just more proof that benchmarks can, at times, be misleading as the overall UI experience is a lot faster here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Useful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone and Contacts app are separated on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, unlike on its Honeycomb-running telephony-packing predecessors. What was essentially 5 tabs of the same app are now split into two. Groups, Contacts and Favorites are in the Contacts app, while Dialer and Logs are part of the Phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no History tab for every contact like there used to be in the Honeycomb phonebook, instead individual contacts logs are accessed via the settings menu in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact management is fairly straightforward on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this and you can also let the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 sync your social network contacts if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on the top left corner, as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one at the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options - edit contact, import/export, join with another contact, send or print a namecard, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done via a popup window, where the available fields are displayed, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn't existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren't available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice and video telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log are found in the dedicated Phone app. There's a Favorite contacts tab as well. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Voice dialing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging app layout is similar to that of the phonebook - you get contacts on the left and the conversations on the right.There's an application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically transformed into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Email and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 comes with two familiar email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic one to use with any POP3/IMAP account you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single message, the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and and only check your mail manually. There's also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's basically the same treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual Samsung QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now, this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won't notice any big difference when handling short emails. Samsung has added a fifth numeric row to the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the keyboard is too big for you, there is a dedicated virtual key on its top left, which will shrink it a bit. The keys become smaller and thinner, making more room for the message body. It's still comfortable enough to type on - this is actually our preferred keyboard size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's auto correction and auto capitalization available, and you can enable sounds on key presses. There's haptic feedback too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A gallery we love<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality, feeling pretty comfortabley on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one difference between the Honeycomb and the ICS gallery - the latter has bigger album thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper left corner holds the sorting options while the right one has the shortcuts to the camera, and some extra settings (like the option to make Picasa albums available offline).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit - the camera shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery app of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 displays the images in full resolution and a double tap zooms to the handy for pixel-peepers 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more fancy way to zoom in and out using multi-touch. Just put your thumbs on a picture and tilt the tablet up or down to zoom in and out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player does fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 has the custom TouchWiz music player, which is more functional than the stock Android app, but lacks the cover-flow-like browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now sort your tracks by album, artist, genre, folders, composer or year. Playlists are enabled too: the most played and recently added lists are automatically generated. Naturally, there's also a search option, which will be appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) the interface splits into three screens - the filters on the left, the album in the middle and the now playing track on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the song name brings you to a dedicated now playing screen where you have a repeat (one or all) and shuffle options, as well as a setting to add the currently playing track to favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers are available too, along with various sound effects like concert hall, clarity etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name along with the usual music shortcuts (something missing on the Honeycomb 3.1 version on the bigger Galaxy Tabs). There is also an option to shut down the music player directly from this menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The awesome video player returns<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android doesn't have a dedicated video player app, but Samsung always provides one of their own for the Galaxy Tabs. The Tab 2 10.1 is no exception. Allowing thumbnail, list and folder view modes, it's a pretty capable application. There's also searching so even if you fill that ample storage with short clips you should be able to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 supports DivX/XviD/MKV files out of the box. Even high-res videos are handled trouble-free - the tablet played anything we tried, including 1080p videos. Subtitles are also available and there is rich encoding support. There was nothing the Tab 2 10.1 wouldn't play. It seems Samsung has put support for every common audio and video codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few full-screen options too - normal, fill and stretch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 gets amazing scores all over and if it wasn't for its below average volume levels it would have been really perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output is still impressively clean for the most part. The stereo crosstalk does increase, but the rest of the readings are barely affected, adding up to a very solid overal performance. Sadly, volume levels are only average again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3MP worth of stills, lovely HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3.15 megapixel main camera capable of doing 720p videos and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera (with VGA video) is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. Given tablets aren't the most photography-friendly devices, it's probably as much as you are going to need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two cameras are mostly there to cater for video-chatting and augmented reality, and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy line o fsmartphones, with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a few samples to demonstrate the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 camera. We found it to be pretty good for the 3 megapixel league - low noise, enough detail, accurate colors and a good balance between contrast and dynamic range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different, really. There are fewer options available here, but the layout is basically the same. The Galaxy Tab is capable of recording 720p videos at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos are top-notch with stereo audio recording, full of detail, low in noise and, generally, nice and smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is a match for most of the HD capable flagships and tablets and our video compare tools is here to prove it. Of course, there are a few 1080p capable camcorders using the same hardware so there is room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 in our Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with, you get quad-band GSM radios with 3G speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. It is GPS equipped as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well, on top of the 16/32GB of internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that (the original connectivity kit with 2 adapters - SD reader and USB port - costs $25). Using one you can connect card readers, USB flash drives and other compatible devices to your tablet and access their contents through the file manager. Mice and keyboards are supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy an HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable.There's no NFC connectivity on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web-browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. There is full Flash 11 support and tabbed browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own screen with a split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There's also a most visited and today tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn't need any extra software - you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also auto-complete for forms and passwords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Flash performance - the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 does great at 360p, 480p and 720p videos right in the browser. Flash games run well too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause panning stutter, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, including the Polaris Office with both viewing and editing documents enabled. It has a nice user interface and solid file management. It supports both internal and web storage (via Box.net).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing word documents, spreadsheets and Power Point files is hassle-free. There's a PDF reader in the bundle as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive. You can set multiple alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a bundle of custom apps provided by Samsung on the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1: My files, S Memo and Photo editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Memo is a pretty simple application for taking notes with sticky-note-like interface. In addition to the text it allows you to draw pictures and offers some extra options such as color, background, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Files is a familiar app - it's the nicely functional Samsung file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Photo Editor offers some basic picture edition tools - selections, rotate, resize, crop, color effects and adjustments, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a video editor app as well. It covers all the basics - trimming, merging, transitions and effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and unlimited navigation, in supported countries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and 3rd party SatNav apps are in danger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now though, turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them, the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has the apps, the Hubs have the books and the music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android market, now called Google Play, is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure that you won't be having a shortage of software to install on your Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. True, some apps aren't designed to work on a WXGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new design makes it easier for you to find the quality apps. There are featured apps, editors' picks and staff-recommended apps in addition to the usual top free and top paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn't forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and categories for the different types of apps so you don't get lost. Recommendations are also based on your location to make it even easier to spot a quality app in the new Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if by some reason, the soon-to-become number 1 app repository on the market isn't enough for you, you might want to check out some of the alternatives. Amazon has set up its own appstore and so has Opera, plus a few more minor app stores here and there. Choice is one of the best parts of the open platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own store called SamsungApps is also on board. There you can get a lot of free apps for your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Hub is here too. It has quite the music collection and the prices are pretty much the same as on the iTunes Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting store is the Readers Hub. There you can purchase subscriptions (or single issues) of newspapers (PressDisplay service), magazines (Zinio service) and e-Books (Kobo service). It's really comfy to have this entire functionality in a single reading app - good job, Samsung!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This Galaxy Tab 2 is a sensible package for a reasonable price. Alright, it may be short on thrills - but what matters here is it's good at the essentials. And not just good enough - it's a great portable video player and the browsing experience is top notch too. Ice Cream Sandwich, full telephony support and memory expansion are the immediate benefits over the original Galaxy Tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are they enough to justify an upgrade? Most likely not - if you have the original 10" Samsung tablet, the Note 10.1 is the device to look at. Or, you can simply wait for the ICS update, which shouldn't be too long now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, if you're about to get your first tablet, or planning an upgrade to a bigger screen, the Tab 2 10.1 looks like a reasonable choice. And one that won't put a big dent in your budget either. With the launch of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Samsung are ready to match the price and beat the specs of the iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen resolution is nominally higher - but the aspect ratio is the bigger advantage. The expandable memory and voice calls are also points in Samsung tablet's favor. The wide video codec support and Flash in the browser count too. Essentially, an Android tablet is the natural choice for users who won't put up with the confines of a closed ecosystem. Of course, others will appreciate the better stocked app store and the slightly smoother experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another second-gen alternative to consider is the Motorola XOOM 2 3G. It has the same screen, chipset and battery but will have to wait a little longer for an update to ICS. A proper microUSB port and HDMI are nice touches but it doesn't offer voice calls and will have trouble matching the rich media-playing capabilities of a Samsung tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola XOOM 2 3G MZ616</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer (the original one) is a worthy competitor too. It's already been updated to ICS and is one of the hottest slates on the market. The 10-incher is powered by the Tegra 2 chipset and has an 5MP still camera with 1080p video recording, 16/32GB of storage and a miniHDMI port. An optional keyboard dock features a full laptop-like QWERTY keyboard, complete with an extra battery, USB ports and an SD card reader. It lacks 3G connectivity, though so you should only consider it if you always use your slate near a Wi-Fi hotspot or if you plan to use your smartphone as one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Transformer TF101</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 inhabits a niche that's hardly too crowded - affordable 10" slates are not easy to come by, so it should have plenty of market potential at launch. The problem is, the niche itself might seize to exist in a few months' time as quad-core slates' prices start to drop. But hey, there's always something newer and better just around the corner and if you don't feel like waiting another 6 months before getting your tablet, going for the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is a move you are unlikely to regret.</paragraph>
