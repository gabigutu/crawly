			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When talking about flagships, one name that keeps on popping up alongside the likes of Samsung and Sony is Oppo. Needless to say, it has long stopped being a surprise. With solid offerings of the past two generations in the Find 5 and N1, Oppo is not just planning to stay in the major league but get a place near the top with the Find 7, one of the precious few smartphones to sport a QHD display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 narrowly comes in second to the LG G3 (although in some markets it'll actually be available before it), after Oppo probed the market with its consciously lesser specced 1080p sibling, the Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another variant of the Find 7/7a floating around in the form of the OnePlus One. OnePlus, which initially surfaced as a breakaway company from Oppo, likely has more than a bit to do with their former compatriots than they're letting on, given how similar the One is to the Find 7. Take away the higher-res screen, software UI, and microSD card slot, and they're almost identical devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of this is to say that Oppo has released this particular smartphone in various different forms, with the Find 7 potentially being the culmination. Like we said, it's only the second QHD-enabled smartphone on the market, and offers a compelling package any way you look at it. Here's the nitty-gritty:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without the fancy sensors and software features that some of the competition have, the Oppo Find 7 has the makings of a very robust flagship thanks to its capable Snapdragon 801. The QHD display will help enhance the user experience that much more, and is trusted compensate for the lack of other extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously the screen is the major feature here, but with great resolution comes great responsibility. Contrast ratio, colors, and even battery life and performance were significantly affected on the LG G3 - the Oppo Find 7's only QHD rival at this time - so it's important to see how upping the resolution impacts the overall smartphone experience. To that end, the Find 7 has the more capable chipset and more battery capacity than the 7a, but will that be enough?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First thing's first though. Up next we get things under way with our traditional hardware examination of the Oppo Find 7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Oppo Find 7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If the retail package of the Oppo Find 7 looks familiar, that's because it's identical to the one we saw with the Oppo Find 7a. Its hardened plastic is of excellent quality, with compartments for the Find 7 itself, A/C adapter, headset, and microUSB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get in the box is a rather large charger (it's a high-current, fast charging unit capable of 4.5A output), a separate microUSB cable for connectivity and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compartments of the box can be removed, making it an excellent box to store all sorts of memorabilia.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oppo Find 7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 measures 152.6 x 75 x 9.2mm, which is the exact same measurements as the 7a. The only difference that the sharper screen makes is weight - not that anyone would notice a single gram worth of a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, a mere gram of added weight is even more impressive if you keep in mind that the battery capacity has also been increased by 200mAh to 3,000mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 is almost as big as the Note 3 phablet and bigger than Samsung's Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7, like its 7a counterpart, is a premium device thanks to its solid construction, pleasantly-textured back panel, and thin profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo continues to insist on the assertive, angular styling the Find 5 introduced to the series, and we don't mind that at all. The most notable difference between the two generations is the absence of a "chin" - on the Find 5 the white finish of the back extends to the bottom front, which was a very nice accent. The 7 has a more conservative all-black front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is covered with what looks like a proprietary factory installed screen protector though it seems it can be removed. Sony ships their phones with a similar screen coating, though non-removable, for shatter proofing the screen in its Xperia line. The Oppo Find 7 has the latest Gorilla Glass 3, of course, but we don't mind the extra touch of care - especially when it's up to the user to keep or get rid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Find 7 is made of textured plastic, which is even better than the finish we've seen on some other Oppo handsets. The Find 7 is really a pleasure to handle, while having an almost rugged feel and great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 has one foot in phablet territory with a big 5.5" screen. Still, we found it reasonably easy to operate, its controls (lock key, volume rocker) conveniently placed and accessible with just one hand too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of controls, let's take a closer look at the Oppo Find 7 and see what's included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we see the standard pieces of equipment around the earpiece: a 5MP front-facing camera, along with proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the usual set of three capacitive keys - Menu, Home and Back. Those have a very faint and dim blue backlight and are barely visible even when the backlight is set to always on. We initially thought this was a hardware problem with our Find 7a, but as they have shown up in our Find 7 as well, we can safely assume that the keys are dim on purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, just below the bottom deck of controls is a notification light strip, which lights up gradually for a nice visual effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Oppo Find 7 features the volume rocker and a tiny pinhole near the bottom to release the battery cover. You'll need a pointed object to release the battery cover - a normal ball pen tip usually does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is the only control on the left. We find its location a bit hard to get used to as most smartphones meant for the European and US market have it on the right-hand side but it's not a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone is a microUSB port and the mouthpiece. At the top is the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens is at the back, along with a dual-LED flash and a loudspeaker grille. There's also a tiny secondary microphone above the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 has the so-called Super Zoom feature to create a 50MP image out of four 13MP shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 3,000mAh user-replaceable Li-Ion battery. The micro-SIM compartment and microSD slot are also around, but you'll have to remove the battery to access them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we touched on earlier, when it comes to the Find 7, the killer feature is obviously the display. It's a 5.5-inch IPS panel of 1440 x 2560px, resulting in around 534ppi. Viewing angles are great, and you can also use the screen with gloves if you turn on the respective setting in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in a line. It's the same pattern that you'll see on the QHD toting LG G3 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen contrast is very good - better than what we saw on the G3 - and not too far behind the majority of 1080p flagships like the HTC One (M8) and Sony Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is another story, unfortunately. We saw even worse numbers here than on the Find 7a, and 1.691 rating is poorer than the G3 was able to muster - which were already low to begin with. The factory-installed screen protector may have played a role here, as it's quite the finger-print magnet and reduces sunlight legibility due to its reflectivity. We didn't try to remove it on our review unit, but we would have without a doubt done so if it was a personally purchased device. The Gorilla Glass 3 layer on top should be enough to keep the screen in top shape even without a screen protector film.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo has bumped the battery on the Find 7 to 3,000mAh, which is a step above the 2,800mAh unit found on the Find 7a. It's a logical step as it's expected that the higher-res screen will need more juice - an expectation that proved to be all too true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the on the LG G3, QHD screens apparently take a lot of power to run, and activities performed with the screen on - like web browsing and watching videos - took a serious toll. 3G talk time and an ample ultimately salvaged the score to be a somewhat acceptable 44 hours, but that's only with one hour of talking, surfing, and watching videos per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7's 4.5Amp charger can fully charge the battery in about an hour, which is a plus. If in a hurry, a few minutes on the charger will give the Find 7 enough juice to last a couple of hours, and a 30 minute charge is enough bring it to 75%. These are officially supplied numbers from Oppo but we found them to hold true in our own testing as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Oppo Find 7 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Complete connectivity package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes jam-packed with connectivity features. It has quad-band GSM, penta-band HSPA and quad-band LTE Cat.4. There's dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, microUSB 2.0 with USB On-the-go support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One useful app here is the System update app, which helps you update the phone's software over the air or from a local file (a ZIP saved in the internal memory). The latter is one of the easiest software upgrade utilities we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Data monitor app preloaded on the Oppo Find 7, which keeps track of data used over Wi-Fi and the carrier network. The app can set limits and also break down the used data by apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Color OS atop Android Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7 runs on Oppo's proprietary Color OS v1.2, which is another name for a heavily skinned Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. The Oppo's launcher customizations run very deep, they keep all Google apps and services, and even bring quite a few of its own - themes support, new lockscreen, homescreen, app drawer and settings menu among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not into custom UIs, there is a preinstalled theme called Jelly Bean, which replicates the stock Android Jelly Bean UI for you as close as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick Color OS rundown on video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Color OS lockscreen is almost identical to the stock Android one. There's an unlock ring, which you slide to get to the homescreen. You can have widgets on the lockscreen, which are located to the left of the main window, while on the right there's a camera shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen supports double tap to wake gesture which also works on the Home key. The lockscreen also has a hidden flashlight shortcut - a press and hold of the Home button (the screen needs to be awake) turns on the dual-LED flash on the back of the device. It turns off when you let go of the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of the Oppo Find 7 likes to keep things huge - its apps above the dock are organized in a grid of 4x4 and the widgets are hardly optimized for the large, high resolution screen. On the up side, you can add up to 9 homescreen panes, whereas most custom launchers top out at 7 (the stock Android one is fixed at 5).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen is reserved for the dock. You can have any shortcuts or folders you like here - you can even move the app drawer shortcut (but not remove it altogether as you won't be able to access it). The dock has four default shortcuts (Dialer, Messaging, App drawer and Camera) by default, but you can actually fit a fifth one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exclusive space is Oppo's custom homescreen page. Currently, there are only two available - Photo and Music. Photo space takes up a whole homescreen and features a live viewfinder so you can take shots straight from your homescreen plus a shortcut to the full camera app. Below you get a timeline with all your recent photos and you can share them very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second Exclusive space homescreen pane is Music. It features a cool, if slightly intuitive design with a vinyl for changing the currently playing song and stopping/resuming playback. You can change songs, go directly to the music player or the Phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By holding a finger on an empty spot on the homescreen or performing a swipe up from the dock you open up the contextual menu. It lists widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes. You drag widgets upwards to place them on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's Color OS supports themes, one of which changes the appearance and functionality of Color OS to match that of stock Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the notification area will show one row of quick toggles, a brightness slider and a shortcut for enabling auto brightness mode, the current notifications plus a shortcut to go into settings. If you do a drag gesture from the quick toggles row you get two more lines of toggles. There's also a Kill all apps button there. At the bottom of the notification area sits a clear button to remove all your notifications at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on a toggle will bring up its respective settings entry. By the way, you can access the notification area even if you slide down from any empty part of the homescreen (not just the top), which helps single-handed use a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is pretty close to stock Android. All your apps are shown in a vertically-scrollable grid of thumbnails, which you swipe either side to close or tap to open. Oppo has added a Kill All toggle at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is pretty simple - it has horizontally scrollable pages of 20 shortcuts or folders. A small green dot marks newly installed apps that haven't been launched yet. You can re-arrange or add to homescreen shortcuts by a tap-and-hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the wallpaper with live or static ones and change the scrolling effect of the homescreens. There's one more option - Live Weather - it can flicker snow, rain, dandelions, etc. over the screen. The effect is very impressive - for instance, snow would pile up on your dock icons and the bottom of your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Gesture panel. You access it just like you would open your notification area, but you need to start your swipe in the left quarter of the bar at the top, just as if you were pulling down the notification area. You can perform various gestures in the Gesture panel to open different apps. For instance drawing a circle would open the camera app but you can assign any apps to any gestures you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Gesture &amp; motion menu deserves our attention. It holds all the various gesture and motion tricks to make your life with the Find 7 easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one you can swipe with three fingers across the screen to capture a screenshot or pinch with several fingers to launch the camera and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motion options are very useful, too - flipping the device will mute the ringer, raising the ringing Oppo Find 7 to your ear will automatically answer the call and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the LG G3, the Oppo Find 7 has a Guest mode. It only gives access to apps that you've pre-selected so you can share your phone without worrying about private data or settings getting messed with. In order to use Guest Mode you'll need to set up a pattern or password unlock for regular access and seperate1425 one for Guest Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Color OS strives to be more feature rich than stock Android and has been customized quite deeply. It is still Android though, so users who are familiar with the OS won't have trouble knowing their way around Color OS. In fact most of Oppo's additions are quite welcome and improve the overall user experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 features a very similar chipset and processor, and identical GPU to its 1080p-toting sibling, the Find 7a. Both devices have a quad-core Krait 400 Snapdragon 801 CPU and Adreno 330 graphics, but the Snapdragon 801 chip on the Find 7 is of the MSM8974AC variant is clocked in at 2.5GHz, (as opposed to the AB on the Find 7a clocked in at 2.3GHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This puts the Find 7 in a unique position to match up directly with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5, and possibly even beat it in some of our tests thanks to its 3GB of RAM. Keep in mind that the Find 7 is the only device - besides the LG G3 - that features a QHD display, so expect slightly lower graphic benchmark results due to it having to push out more pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 demonstrates some serious horsepower in our GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 benchmarks which put to the test the hardware combo inside the smartphone. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance, etc. The Find 7 beats out all current flagships in these two tests, very impressive from Oppo.</paragraph>

		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single-core, multi-core, and math performance, among others. We focus on the overall and CPU scores. We didn't detect any difference between the scores posted in the original and anti-cheat versions of the benchmark. Again, great numbers posted by the Oppo Find 7.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan. In 1080p offscreen mode the GPU is tasked with performing graphical computations in 1920 x 1080px resolution, while the onscreen mode uses the screen's native 2560 x 1440px resolution. T-Rex is the less demanding of the two tests and here the Find 7 comes in just below 20fps in the onscreen test, which is at the bottom of the pack but still good considering the higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more demanding Manhattan benchmark has the Find 7 keeping pace in offscreen performance, but at a measly 6.7fps in the onscreen test - again partially excused by the higher resolution compared to its competitors. Still anything under 30fps raises a flag so you might run into some issues with game titles aimed at taking full advantage of the higher resolution - the technology is just not there yet.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2.1 looks at HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Find 7 again scores second in both tests, which should result in a very robust browsing experience considering the 5.5-inch screen with 534ppi. It should be a step ahead of 1080p-toting devices when it comes to text crispness and fidelity.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 shows stunning performance when it comes to our compound benchmarks, where it beats out all of the current flagship competition thanks to its robust chipset and 3GB of RAM. Browsing performance is also great, and fast browsing on the QHD screen is a definite plus for the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the 1440p screen took its toll when it came to graphics performance. The extra resolution it had to pump out made it come in behind current 1080p flagships, and even the LG G3 - its only QHD rival - was also able to beat it out. Still, integrated mobile GPU's have clearly not caught up to displays yet, so the Find 7 is just about as good as it gets when looking at overall performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contact management and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface - it offers groups, then there's the contact list and favorites. The UI is pretty standard Android affair, save for the custom paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Anti-harassment mode located in the contacts app, which is pretty powerful. You can put numbers in a blacklist, block messages and intercept spam calls. The strange thing is, you can't block people from within the messaging or phone app - only in the contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing just fine (looking up both names and phone numbers). The Oppo Find 7 offers a Holiday mode, in which only notifications and calls from a whitelist of users will get through, while the rest will get muted or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Notify on connect - the phone can vibrate or ring (or both) when a call connects. You can also build a list of texts to send when you decline a call. Flip to mute calls is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 scored a Good mark on our loudspeaker test, which means you should have no problem hearing it in all but the loudest of environments</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we did the test with various Wave MaxxAudio sound presets - the results varied between Good and Very Good. The main difference came from the Pink Noise test, which is a clear testament to the fact that the Wave sound presets are quite capable of tuning how music sounds through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 loudspeaker is really loud no matter what preset you are using, but you can squeeze out even more courtesy of the Wave effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized into threads, with a big New Message button at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts is also included and supports SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 offers a great Swype-enabled keyboard with big keys and they become even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing. There is an option to change the individual key height in both portrait and landscape, which isn't found that often. Themes are available too. You can also have split or mini keyboard layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the device in landscape expands the keyboard immensely but leaves too little space for the text box above and we found ourselves never really using landscape as the portrait keyboard was spacious enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A custom gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo Find 7 is a custom job, but surprisingly one with less features than the vanilla app. Obviously, Oppo has approached this interface with a less-is-more tactic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can't filter images by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app. Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid and you have two options - image selection mode and start a slideshow. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it or get a menu with more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image editor offers light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights, you can apply effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has some drawbacks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes with a pretty simple-looking video player, which supports DivX, AVI, MKV, MP4, etc. We had no issues playing files all the way up to 1080p resolution and the only real setback were certain files with XviD video or AC3 sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files. The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work, and be in the same directory). Also, some foreign language subtitles didn't display all characters correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching a video you get a timeline scrubber, play/pause along with forward/back controls, a lock option (which locks the display against accidental touches) and a pop up toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung/LG flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no transparency option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and Wave effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo's latest music player has quite a simplistic interface and is very easy to use and navigate. It supports the Oppo's latest audio customizations called Wave MaxxAudio as well as Dirac HD Audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave audio enhancements apply on all music-related apps and games no matter if you are using headphones or the loudspeaker. There are a few Wave presets you can use, but you can also customize one preset by yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize some basic options such as maximum bass, treble, volume and dialog, but you can also completely configure the audio frequency curve. So if you are using some high-quality headphones, you can fully customize your audio experience. We wish Oppo had provided an automatic configuration similar to Samsung's Adapt Sound though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a local list of all music, favorites, artists, albums and folders. There's also an option to add a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art/music controls screen. You can swipe between the two. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them under the album art, which imitates a vinyl record. You can add album art if it's not built inside the tracks (but the player won't look for it automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. That cycles through Off, Dolby and Dirac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the music player successfully played a 16-bit FLAC file so there is hardly anything it won't play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on, the notification area lets you control the playback via an expandable notification but there are no music controls on the lockscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good, but not the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 put in a stellar performance in the first part of our audio quality test. It had excellently high volume levels to go with its very clean output. Barring for the slightly high IMD reading this is one of the best score sets we've seen lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the smartphone faltered quite a bit when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Its frequency response started missing the mark now and then, the IMD rose further and the stereo crosstalk hiked quite a bit. It's not as bad as the stereo crosstalk disaster that was the 7a, but elsewhere the more premium member of the pair lagged behind its stablemate. Volume level dropped as well, adding up to what was a good, but not quite flagship-worthy performance here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera can shoot 50MP stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like on the Find 7a, Oppo has put a lot of neat tech into the Find 7's 13MP camera, all the while keeping the interface as unobtrusive as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is based around a Sony Exmor IMX214 BSI 1/3.06" CMOS sensor of 13MP resolution. The lens has a bright, F/2.0 aperture, and is capable of producing 50MP interpolated shots, RAW images, HDRs and Panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo Find 7 is quite in tune with the recent selfie fixation, and comes equipped with a 5MP front snapper, which takes some nice photos as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the regular flash mode, the dual-LED flash can work in fill light mode, producing a natural looking image without any color shift or strong shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen there's a little three dot toggle, which will guide you through the different shooting modes - Beauty, Panorama, HDR, Ultra HD Picture, RAW, GIF, Audio Photo, Slow Shutter and Normal. Our unit's RAW mode produced files which were a bit rough around the edges at best. Whether Oppo has yet to finish this feature or they intentionally made the resulting .DNG files look like they came out of 1970 we'll leave for you to decide - here's a sample (25.0MB) directly from the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Slow Shutter mode allows for longer than usual exposures - from 1 to 32 seconds. It lets you take some great long exposure shots, but you'll need to use a tripod for best results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultra-HD mode is a very interesting feature advertised as Super Zoom. It snaps ten (probably 13MP) photos then post-processes them to create a single 50MP sample using the sharpest pixels from them, giving you plenty of room to zoom in or crop the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to image quality, the Find 7 does several things well. Colors and contrast tend to be spot on, and the white balance is accurate with good sharpness across the entire frame. Dynamic range tends to vary across images, however, and shadows tend to be underexposed in most circumstances. Resolved detail is great, and Oppo has kept image processing to a minimum so there's not a visible oil painting effect when looking at images up close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a fair amount of noise - something that Samsung, Sony, and LG, among others, address through post-processing - but the resulting images here are sharper than those of the Samsung Galaxy S5, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode helps a little in resolving the dynamic range issues the Find 7 camera encounters, but this comes at a huge expense to color accuracy. Greens and blues in particular become overly vibrant, which is a hair better than being oversaturated, but ultimately results in images that don't reproduce the scene accurately - although this also comes down to personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 features the capability to shoot long exposure images like on the Find 7a, capable of variable shutter speeds ranging from 1s to 32s. It provides results similar to the one seen below, taken from the identical camera on the Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped a few Super Zoom 50MP samples side-by-side with our Lumia 1020 in 38MP mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the 50MP samples all have good colors, contrast and some noise, the resolved detail doesn't stack up. The side-by-side comparison with the Lumia 1020 38MP shots shows Nokia's top cameraphone does a better job, but that was expected since it does boasts a 41MP camera sensor instead of relying on software post-processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We even tried downscaling those to 38MP and see if they are on par with the Lumia's. They are not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo claims the 50MP Ultra HD Picture should be used for high-quality prints. It's worth noting the samples are indeed better than anything we could have achieved by upscaling the regular 13MP to 50MP, so they certainly have their use, especially if you would like to crop and keep only a portion of the image. But we'd still use the excellent 13MP Normal mode most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here is a 5MP shot snapped with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 is also capable of panorama shots, with no resulting problems with the stitching. The quality is comparable to the normal shooting mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 enters our Photo quality comparison tool to compete against the latest flagships. It definitely does a great job on all three charts - the resolved detail is top notch, the colors are quite accurate and the contrast is good too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2160p and 1080p video recording at 30fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 is capable of 2160p and 1080p video capture at 30 frames per second plus 720p slow-mo videos at 120fps. Oppo's specs sheet claims the smartphone is capable of 1080p@60fps recording too, but this mode was absent on our unit (like it was one the Find 7a, as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To compensate, both 4K and 1080p video samples turned out great - there is lots of resolved detail and the quality is similar to the stills - accurate colors and very good contrast, although shadows are again on the dark side. Both modes produced samples with a steady 30fps frame rate. Check out the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched 2160p@30fps(0:11s, 53.5MB) and 1080p@30fps(0.15s, 15.4MB) video samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes with Google Chrome as its preinstalled browser. The interface is the same as on any other Android smartphone - clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. Incognito tabs are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on customizable settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing by choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a Data monitor app preloaded on the Oppo Find 7, which scans how much data you've used through Wi-Fi and the carrier network you're using. The app can set limits for usage and also break down the used data by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data Saving app allows you to restrict the data usage in background mode. You can choose which apps are allowed to use background data and which are restricted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes with Kingsoft Office preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor that can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations. It can link to cloud storage, email files, create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled too so you can get some work done on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kingsoft has since dropped support for its Office application, and has instead published an updated version under the name of WPS Office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has three views that you can swipe between. First is the Year view, which aggregates all 12 months with all of their days, a month view, which has little red dots for events and the agenda view, which is a vertically scrollable grid of events. Sadly, year view doesn't show little dots for when there's an event, despite the screen being large and high-res enough to allow it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is pretty simple to use - it has big, thumbable keys. In order to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.) you just have to turn the smartphone sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app lets you create complex notes with text, images and hand drawn notes. You can even set a password for your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app, a sound recorder and a 3D compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP server support, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now, accessed by swiping up from any of the navigation buttons, integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice Google searches as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7 comes with a GPS/GLONASS receiver. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. If rough positioning will do, Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are on it. Wi-Fi positioning can work even if Wi-Fi is disabled or you can turn this off to save battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution already. The public transport option can be very useful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps show alternative routes and you can see alerts if there are any potential holdbacks along your route like construction zones, traffic jams and so on. Google's involvement with the live traffic info crowd-sourcing app - Waze - seems to be paying off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also supports the Street View mode, allowing you to see the landmarks you're looking for before you set off. That makes them much easier to find when you arrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added a small "designed for phones" warning for apps that don't have tablet interfaces. Those can look bad on the large screen, so it's nice to be forewarned.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Whether it's a smartphone you're buying these days or looking for a new car, laptop, even a pair of shoes, there's always an overriding factor: brand recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reason for most people to choose a new pair of Nike's over a no-name manufacturer is the same one that makes it so hard for brands like Oppo to be a regular part of the conversation when premium phones are involved. It's also the same reason, despite its excellent performance, stellar camera, and beautiful screen, that most buyers will be prejudiced against the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7 has so much going for it - and so few areas where it falls short - that it's hard not to get excited about what the upstart Chinese company has been able to achieve with its latest flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only is the Find 7 currently the sole alternative to the LG G3 when it comes to QHD-screened smartphones, but it bests the Korean offering's performance by leaps and bounds. In fact, where the G3 struggled - either due to the QHD display or unfinished software - the Find 7 shined and then some, even beating the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 in our composite benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't get too ahead of ourselves, however, as there is one rather important caveat. With the G3 we saw that having to power a QHD display takes a lot of extra juice, and with the Find 7 things are just as bad, if not worse. Despite bumping up the battery to 3,000mAh over its Find 7a model, the Find 7 scored very poorly in our dedicated battery test, especially when it came to web browsing and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo slightly made up for this by including its hefty 4.5A dedicated charger, which the company claims can charge your battery up to 75% in just 30 minutes. Granted, having to lug around a charger everywhere you go is hardly practical, but the fact that you can top up your battery in just a short pit stop still counts for something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a list of our other key test findings for the Oppo Find 7:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking for QHD-toting competition, the list is currently very short. The LG G3 is the only other major smartphone that offers a 1440p display, as well as Android 4.4 KitKat with LG's Optimus UI. You'll also get slightly more mileage out of its 3,000mAh battery, but the QHD display still takes quite a toll when it's on. Despite sporting the same screen diagonal, the G3 is also the more compact device, but the Find 7 is the better performer, even more so if you get the 16GB LG G3 that only has 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If having a 1440p screen is not on your list of must-haves, the Oppo's Find 7a is a very reasonable option. It offers 1080p resolution across the same screen diagonal, and features only a slightly underclocked processor and 2GB of RAM that nonetheless provide great performance. You'll find the same Android 4.3 build with ColorOS overlay in the Find 7a, and its 2,800mAh battery provides significantly more time between charges than the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 7a</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo subsidiary breakaway OnePlus offers many of the same features that were introduced with the Find 7a in its new One flagship. Although it does away with the expandable storage, the OnePlus One has the same processor as the Find 7, a larger 3,100mAh battery, and very commendable (admittedly similar) design. Better yet, the One runs on a custom-built CyanogenMod 11S ROM based on Android 4.4.2 KitKat, and records in a high fidelity 2160p DCI mode that has more vertical pixels than regular 4K recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> OnePlus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is one of the top-performing flagships in its class, and with competitive pricing in many regions should be a stiff competitor to the Oppo Find 7. Although it can't match it in screen fidelity and performance, the S5 comes with IP67 dust and water resistance, as well as an arguably more robust Android 4.4.2 KitKat build with Samsung's TouchWiz overlay. Also, you'll get significantly more battery life out of its 2,800mAh unit, and there's a bunch of sensors and an IR-port that aren't on the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 from Sony is impressive offering as well, coming with a capable camera and top-notch performance from its Snapdragon 801 chipset. Although it can't roll with the Find 7 in terms of performance, it's the 7's stiffest competitor in that regard thanks to the 3GB of RAM. You'll also be getting water resistance and Sony's premium design aesthetic, as well as over double the battery life compared to the Find 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the one hand it's easy to recommend the Find 7 - it's a robust flagship with top-of-the-line performance, a stellar display, and a very capable software package. But getting only 5 hours of web browsing per charge is a tough pill to swallow, and could end up being the deciding factor that keeps users away from QHD smartphones this generation. The technology just isn't there yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also important to remember that Oppo and LG are two manufacturers that played their QHD trump cards early, and international 1440p-toting responses from Samsung and Sony could change things dramatically. For now, the Find 7 has its time in the spotlight - hopefully it won't end up as the best smartphone that nobody bought.</paragraph>
