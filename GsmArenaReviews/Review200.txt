			<paragraph>Full steam into the megapixel chase, Sony Ericsson C902 is trying to show off its best before the 8 megapixel monsters start stealing the show. The Cyber-shot pedigree, touch-controlled camera and metal outfit are true predator stuff and now that we have a retail unit in our hands it's time to revisit our pre-release preview of the device and see if there are any chinks in its armor that may turn predator to prey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Revisiting the C902 is also worth it as a taster of what's to come. It's been quite a while since our first glimpse, but Sony Ericsson didn't just sit on their hands in the meantime. The company made the very first announcement of an 8-megapixel cameraphone - the C905, which we previewed this summer. The other exciting prospect is the Walkman-meet-Cybershot W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, while the two sharpshooters above are yet to be baptized by fire, our Sony Ericsson C902 is right in the thick of action. The ironclad Cyber-shot is the thinnest 5 MP cameraphone on the market and that makes it quite an attractive deal. That alone is hardly enough of an edge though over a bunch of strong contenders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If every ounce of style should count, the extra sleek C902 is in for quite a challenge against the exquisite LG KF750 Secret. Other than superb exterior, the Secret flaunts VGA video at 30fps plus QVGA at 120fps. The Secret's tangibly bigger 2.4" display is another great asset. The C902 with its 2" screen can hardly stand up to DivX movies of up to VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KF750 Secret</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those who don't mind keeping a low profile, Samsung G600 gets its edge from affordability. The year-old offer have sure lost some appeal but currently the cheapest 5 MP cameraphone might still be able to steal some market. By the same token, the inexpensive LG KC550 is also worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung G600 ? LG KC550</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung F480 Tocco is another viable option with a full touch interface, gorgeous large display and a nice 5 megapixel camera. It's just a tad thicker than the Sony Ericsson C902, but comes at a slightly heftier pricetag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung F480 Tocco</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our roundup of 5 MP shooters won't be complete without Nokia N82. For the same asking price, the Symbian-powered N82 delivers bigger screen estate, WLAN and GPS. The imaging department is also quite tempting with xenon flash and VGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N82</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Sony Ericsson K850 might still enjoy robust demand. What used to be the Cyber-shot finest offers tri-band HSDPA and a larger 2.2" display. Other benefits include Xenon flash and dual memory card support (both M2 and microSD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson K850</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way or another, the sleek and thin C902 still seems fit enough, and the suave styling sure saves it from obscurity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C902 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 carries its 107 g of weight with grace. At 108 x 49 x 10.5 mm, the handset is quite a portly piece and that makes the thin girth even sweeter. The metal casing and the conservative black styling do give it a solid reassuring elegance. Glossy surfaces dominate the front, the all matt rear is quite friendly to the touch. The phone is available in Swift Black, Luscious Red, Titanium Silver, and Cinnamon Bronze.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 looks a normal bar, but the form factor is not quite set in stone. The handset is complete with a rare slide-up lens cover. The sliding action is smooth, with distinct locking at both the opened and closed end. The whole set up is certainly convenient for landscape shooting. The only grudge is the plastic surface that gets exposed right above the screen just tends to collect a lot of dust. The area around the lens at the back is a lot less prone to getting dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very top up front are the secondary video-call camera and ambient light sensor. In between is the narrow cleft of the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 has a surprisingly small TFT display of QVGA resolution. When the display is off, it does look like at least a 2.2 incher, but with the lights on the reason for this size is obvious - there are eight touch sensitive camera keys that backlight in blue around the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In camera mode they are responsible for switching between video and still camera, accessing the photo gallery, changing the autofocus mode, shoot mode, scenes, timer and flash mode. When you tap an icon you need is to wait a slit of a second while the icon smoothly drops down to take its place in the viewfinder status bar. Each tap is accompanied by a short vibration feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The small display deserves very high marks on both color rendering and sunlight legibility, even if it's not a transreflective unit as the ones of G700 and G900. The viewing angle is surprisingly broad without getting the colors washed out. It does remind of the superb K850 display with its deep black color we much appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C902 keypad is barely decent. The glossy alphanumeric keys are set in quite tightly packed rows. They are wide enough and reasonably tactile, but the short stroke is disappointing. What really stands in the way of comfortable typing though is the awkward reverse terracing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad and adjacent controls offer passable ergonomics. There's a notable difference from the beta unit we previewed. The dedicated Call and End knobs are still crammed between the soft keys and the Activity menu and C key, but they are not projecting as much as they used to. That doesn't render them any less usable though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the soft keys are the most problematic, mainly due to their flimsy press. On a different note, the soft keys now have tiny projecting notches, which greatly improve tactility: that's another change over the beta unit we first had. The Clear and Activity menu keys are excellent. The Up and Down keys of the D-pad are perfect, while the sides are a bit less comfortable. The confirm button is very tactile and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is a notable step up from what we had in the preview, though still not quite even enough. The white illumination turns blue and the keypad backlighting is turned off upon sliding the lens cover up or starting the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the handset are distinguished for the black-and-gray stripe pattern. The top and bottom hold no controls. The universal port is on the left, while the right side sports the camera key and the volume rocker. The latter is unusually placed near the bottom below the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, its position is quite handy for its other job: the rocker doubles as zoom control in the camera and gallery. Pressing the volume rocker while in power-saving mode shortly brings the clock up on the otherwise completely blank screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny shutter key is soft and responsive, with distinct half and full press feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the 5 megapixel autofocus camera lies secretly beneath its sliding cover. Opening the cover activates the camera no matter what menu or submenu you are in. It doesn't work only when you have opened some application such as the Calendar, Phonebook or Call log. We find this quite odd and inconvenient. What we like though is that the active lens cover will launch the camera even if the phone is locked and in power saving mode. Plus, sliding it back on will return the handset to its initial locked state. Opening the lens cover lights up a blue LED band on the back of the handset. The shutter key also gets illuminated in blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photoflash LED makes a compact and efficient substitute for the xenon flash used in small digicams and cameraphones. It is said to produce approximately 25 lux/s. Its smaller size and twice less power consumption than standard xenon flash make it especially suitable for portable devices. It doesn't also need to recharge the way xenon needs to after it has fired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our hands-on experience with it revealed it's more powerful than the regular LED flashes, but still tangibly less capable than xenon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the rear panel of the phone reveals the standard Sony Ericsson BST-38 Li-Polymer battery with a capacity of 930 mAh. It's quoted at up to 400 h of standby time and up to 9 h of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, you can expect up to 5 days of sparing use in a 3G network: about 30 minutes of calls and 30 minutes of using other applications. Above the battery compartment are the SIM and the M2 card slots. It's a pity the memory card slot is only accessible after removing the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, we are very pleased with the size and feel of Sony Ericsson C902. The thinnest 5 MP is a solid and reliable handset, and elegant looks are a welcome bonus. Some ergonomic issues could've been handled differently but - all in all - the C902 is a good piece of gear.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface spiced up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in C902 has the well known Sony Ericsson feature phone styling, spiced up with a few new features. Typical hi-end cameraphone, C902 puts the rich photography and multimedia capabilities up front. When it comes to multimedia, the new Cyber-shot products are catching up quickly with the Walkman lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to mention though is the changes (seen on a few other Sony Ericsson phones like the W980) to the main menu structure. Except the traditional 4 x 3 grid matrix, the main menu can now be diversified with a couple of alternative views: rotating and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view shows three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar with position mapping. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access - a good enough reason to forget about the other options once you've tried them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other obvious change is icon animation, bringing notable visual modification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lowest row of icons has mirror effect but some of the transitions we saw in the first beta unit are now strangely missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most previous models, the C902 comes with a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode. The Sony Ericsson G502 cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted though, unlike competing Nokia S40 models. The other irritating thing is that toggling the flight mode requires a reboot of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 supports Flash Lite themes; even some of the preinstalled themes are Flash-based. They change not only the color scheme and the wallpaper, but also the menu icons themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C902 features the well-known Activity menu, which is a really handy, especially for a feature phone. The Running Apps tab of this menu offers basic multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and listen to the radio or to the music player simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web menu and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of favorite features and can be modified to the user liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is present here too, and is found in the My Shortcuts menu, in addition to its original location in the entertainment menu. The service itself has seen changes too. The updates include "Find similar Music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook offers plenty of space<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 is equipped with a phonebook that can store up to 1000 entries with a total of 7000 phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name. You can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be displayed by default. Unfortunately, there is no option for displaying both lists simultaneously. A cool feature of the phonebook lets you auto save to SIM card any new contacts that you're adding to the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, the available details are stored in five available tabs. The first is where you put the name and the numbers, the second holds the email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, custom ringtone, custom message tone and a voice command. The fourth goes for postal details. The last, fifth tab, is for making an additional note and adding a birth date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enter a birthday, Sony Ericsson C902 prompts adding it to the calendar and setting a reminder, which we think, is a handy feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Smart Search completes the set of more important phonebook features. It looks up all the contacts whose numbers contain the digits you type on the stand-by screen. In addition, it also lists the names that start with the letters corresponding to the digits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Call log keeps track of your recent communications. It is divided into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last one gets recorded.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 is great at making and receiving calls. Loudspeaker sound is very loud and crisp and you certainly wouldn't miss an incoming call even in noisy surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Sony Ericsson C902 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. The integrated loudspeaker did great - the Sony Ericsson C902 scored a Very Good mark. More info on our test and all current results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson C902 offers the latest Sony Ericsson Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 handles all common types of messages. With the C902 all messages, except emails, share a common inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit, to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending. There is also a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports push email to boost mobile email usability. Emails are delivered in the background (similar to SMS or MMS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in C902 supports dozens of settings and all types of encodings, just like some of the most advanced messaging devices out there. With high-speed data in focus with this handset, it's hardly a surprise. Sony Ericsson C902 can save attachments, no matter if they are supported or unknown file formats. Email messages can be sorted by size, date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the phone is unable to handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader. So the options are limited to plain text only and you should have that in mind if you're going for the C902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final available options in the Sony Ericsson C902 email client are viewing a message fullscreen and changing the font size (small, medium, large). We did find them both quite handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera performance: touch-sensitive keys score a point<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus shooter offers a good range of niceties as face detection, image and video stabilizer, BestPic, auto-rotate, macro mode, camera images geo-tagging (based on cell-ID), Photo Flash, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the unique camera feature is the eight touch sensitive camera controls that backlight in blue around the display. They are active only in camera mode and are responsible for switching between video and still camera, accessing the photo gallery, changing the autofocus mode, shoot mode, scenes, timer and flash mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has the latest user interface. Its pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings known since K850 are here to facilitate the user experience. The touch-sensitive controls are haptic-enabled, and vibration can also be turned off from the settings multi-tab menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. Sadly, an ISO setting is not available in C902, as compared to K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode however has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the cutest face in the shot. Just joking, even if it's quite random at times, the one that's closest to the center of the frame usually gets the focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image stabilizer is supposed to keep images from blurring in dark environments but, as in all phone cameras so far, it's purely a software tweak of questionable efficiency. Plus no stabilization can help you if your subjects are moving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 9 full-size 5 megapixel images for about 1.3sec, each of them of approximately 1MB of size. Saving all the images on the memory card afterwards takes about 15 seconds. The slow mode takes 9 images again but in a larger interval of about 2.5sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we get to the geo-tagging issue. Sony Ericsson C902 doesn't have GPS on-board but is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images based on cell tower triangulation. This seems to work quite fine with accurate GPS data in dense city areas, where cell towers are closely positioned. We are somehow uncertain about this level of accuracy in other areas with cell towers quite apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, you have access to a "View on map" tab from the options menu, which displays your location directly on the preinstalled Google Maps. If you pair the phone with an external GPS receiver, the geotagging feature automatically starts to use it to collect exact GPS coordinates for the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were unable to test the official claims that the new Photo flash LED is able to provide 3 times more power that the regular LED. Nevertheless, the flash photos came out well and it might be a good trade-off - substituting the xenon flash for a photoflash LED that works in BestPic mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in C902 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm (focus lock is reported in the viewfinder even at 8 cm but the image is actually a bit blurred). The silent shooting mode completes the worth-mentioning features of the C902 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcomings are worth pointing out with the user interface. The first one is that closing the active lens cover results in loss of the latest settings, unless you have taken a photo with these values.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one concerns the menu one-way layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar, as it's the last item there. Browsing items on the toolbar reversely should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C902 camera is a capable shooter. The images are crisp with nice contrast though with an obvious tendency of oversharpened edges, especially in high-contrast areas. Noise level seem relatively high, especially with sufficient light. The autofocus camera does very well at close-ups. Color rendering is relatively good; yet all colors are a bit cold. We think they need some 10% more saturation to ride high. And finally, as usual for Cyber-shots there is a lot of purple fringing - due to imperfection of the lens used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trademark red-to-pink conversion that all recent Sony Ericsson cameraphones manifest is kept under control and we see well balanced reds and pinks (have a look at the images below).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, photos at 100% should not be indicative, as even mid-range digicam quality suffers at full size. Just to give you an idea of what the C902 photos can turn out with just a wee bit of photoediting, here are their versions downsized to 1024x768 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the C902 is also capable of capturing video, even if it's only limited to QVGA resolution at 30fps. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording. Interestingly enough, the C902 camera is officially quoted to record stereo sound to video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flashy Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are obviously trying to place more and more content and options in the media center. We appreciate their effort as we simply love this flash-based interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 is equipped with Music Player 3.0, which is almost the same as the Walkman player 3.0 seen in Sony Ericsson W980. The player supports numerous file formats, including MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC +, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI plus the MegaBass equalizer preset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can naturally be set to run in the background. Sound is audible, crisp and even - as long you're using the player with a good headset, that is. If you are not willing to use the media player step-by-step structure, you can directly play a track through the file manager with its classic flat tree structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player accommodated in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, while the interface is simple and stylish. The built-in motion sensor allows the video player to auto rotate. Again, the video files are accessible via the file manager but there you cannot opt to auto rotate the file, which we found a bit odd. Landscape mode can be set from the menu though. Fullscreen player mode and screenshot capability, are some cool extras in the player. You can save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media center menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, RSS feeds and Settings icons. Along with the traditional functionality we've discussed in detail in several Sony Ericsson reviews, there is one extra icon for Games. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto rotate screen orientation, thanks to the integrated motion sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first section in the Media Center is the Photo gallery. It consists of: Latest Photo, Camera Album, Photo Tags, Photo Feeds, and Pictures. Latest Photo provides quick access to most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year. When a month is open, it reveals a 4x3 grid of thumbs of photos. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month. The highlighted photo is a bit larger for better viewing. The Pictures section opens again as a 4x3 grid of thumbs with non-camera images, as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a powerful tool for conveniently managing a vast collection of camera photos with great customization capabilities. Photo Tags is a feature for displaying previously marked favorite photos. The Up key on the D-pad offers quick access to sending options like: send as Picture Msg, as email, to blog, via Bluetooth. Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow feature are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but kind of pushed aside with the timeline view missing. This is quite a pity, in mind that T650 and K810 have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, videoDJ and musicDJ are also quite common features for all the Sony Ericsson phones, which are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond, yet extreme zooming in won't really reveal more detail. As usual with Cyber-shot phones, viewing full-res images one by one didn't involve any lags at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The game section houses an accelerometer based game - Need for Speed ProStreet. It has a cool 3D interface and is quite entertaining. Oh, and another interesting fact before we spin to another track, here your NFS car can be steered with both the D-pad and the built-in accelerometer function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two games are the well known FotoQuestFishing and Solitaire.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson C902 has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service, which has an updated functionality here as already mentioned. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing is a breeze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C902 has the latest Access NetFront HTML browser 3.4. Elaborate web pages are rendered relatively well and there are lots of configurable settings too. Although there is no dedicated fullscreen mode, the web page automatically rotates in landscape/full screen mode, if the phone is turned horizontally. The other view modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is also up to the standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C902 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb OperaMini browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is a full service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C902 is not an internet-centric device, nor has it a big enough display, but the connectivity options it boasts are full service. Quad-band GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board, so there is virtually no spot on earth where you will be unable to connect. In addition, you've got the fastest data transfer around, provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson C902 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot which might just turn out to be one of the quickest means of transferring data on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C902 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has four modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. The third one is the media transfer, which directly connects to the Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone, synchronization, play or sorting in playlists. The last one is for direct printing of images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C902 offers many time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator, and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for additional applications, the Sony Ericsson C902 comes with the widely used FaceWarp and Photo Mate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled in the C902. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database. With the GPS Enabler HGE-100, plugged in, Location service gets full GPS functionality, as well as A-GPS for faster satellite lock. This makes it possible to use navigation on the go, with turn-by-turn guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a plugged in GPS receiver, the Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. The GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last time we checked Sony Ericsson C902 was a hi-end cameraphone and now it's well into the daily grind of its megapixel league. Not being top-of-the-line is not necessarily a bad thing though. At 250 euro and heading down, Sony Ericsson C902 is a must-consider. The touch-operated camera and unique active lens cover are strong enough points in a handset that won't go unnoticed anyway. The stylish metal bodywork and slim line do give it an edge with the style-conscious users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest - and perhaps the only - letdowns of a cameraphone of this caliber are screen size and the poor video recording capabilities. Still excellent build quality, fast speed data, solid multimedia and great interface in feature phone terms do sound right for the slimmest 5 megapixel cameraphone. So, we see nothing wrong with a cameraphone that looks and acts solid, but doesn't tear a hole in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remaining an excellent alternative in the camera-centric phones realm, the Sony Ericsson C902 still loses to the similarly priced Samsung F480 Tocco with its fancy touch UI and good camera and the Nokia N82 with its superb image quality plus GPS and Wi-Fi. Nevertheless, we enjoyed its company and won't mind seeing it around more often.</paragraph>
