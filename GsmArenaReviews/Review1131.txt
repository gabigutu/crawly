			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Anyone familiar with Research In Motion knows that the people behind BlackBerry have been busy working on the latest version of their OS - BlackBerry 10 - for the better part of a year now. And while RIM promise that BB10 will be their ticket back into contention, it's been quite a while for them without a new release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the BlackBerry Curve is not a part of the BB10, it represents what got RIM into the game at all: a compact QWERTY messenger with to-the-point functionality and mature design. We're as curious as you to see what RIM have been able to do with their Curve lineup over the past half year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Curve 9320, RIM is looking to hold the fort while it gets its ducks in a row for the release of the BB10 lineup. In this case, holding the fort essentially means releasing a device with toned-down specs, which may still entice loyal users and stem the tide of their plummeting market share, if only a little.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at what the BlackBerry Curve 9320 has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 is a notch below the Curve 9360, which was released around the beginning of the year, and the specs are far from impressive. The 56K-color screen of QVGA resolution in particular fails to impress, and the fixed-focus camera has taken a cut in resolution from 5 to 3 megapixels. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the Curve 9320 will find support amidst an (albeit small) group of diehard BlackBerry supporters who are looking for a familiar interface and reasonable performance without breaking the bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now join us as we take a look at the hardware, design and retail packaging of the BlackBerry Curve 9320.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package - nothing beyond the norm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing surprising - or disappointing - about the contents of the BlackBerry Curve 9320 retail package. You get a microUSB data cable, a charger and a single-piece set of earphones. The continental A/C adapter features its USB port on the side rather than on the top, and there's also a UK standard plug as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a 2GB microSD memory card (inserted in your phone) and the usual bunch of papers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Curve 9320 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 stands at 109 x 60 x 12.7 mm and weighs in at 103 grams - almost the same size and weight as the Curve 9360 - although that model was only 11 mm thick. The phone is pleasingly compact and friendly, with no excessive decoration to distract from its functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic construction of the Curve 9320 is characteristic of the Curve family. It is shaped to fit in one hand easily, and the keys are amply distanced from one another to allow quick typing with one or both hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took issue with the glossy back panel, which is prone to fingerprints, and may get slippery enough to fall out of your hand if you're not careful. We can see the back panel getting scratched in no time without a cover of some sort and it doesn't seem to fit well - there's a tangible wobble and occasional creaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What would a BlackBerry be if not for the full QWERTY keyboard? Wellâ?¦probably a Curve 9380, but despite the few exceptions, the messenger form factor is still a BlackBerry trademark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Curve 9320, the keypad is optimized for quick and easy typing. The keys are separated by a small amount of space, but are set sufficiently apart to prevent accidental presses. The firmness and resistance of the keys finds that delicate balance which doesn't go too far in either direction - you can tell RIM have been doing this for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a four-row keypad the numbers had to be accommodated over some of the letters - the numpad is on the left. You will also have to use a two-key combo for all the punctuation. Wherever the context allows it, the switch between numbers and letters is automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial shortcuts. There is a dedicated currency symbol key which doubles as a toggle between the loudspeaker and the earpiece. This toggle also works in the music player, and you can skip tracks back and forth by pressing P or N (previous/next).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical trackpad sits between the display and the keyboard of the BlackBerry Curve 9320. It is adequately responsive by default, but has individual settings to adjust horizontal and vertical sensitivity, and even an option to play sound while using. It can also be pressed whenever you want to make a selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Menu and Back keys and the two call buttons are placed around it. All five of these top buttons have the same solid stroke and press feedback as the QWERTY keyboard, although unlike the keypad keys they barely stick above the surface of the phone itself. The navigation and call buttons are a lot more comfortable to use than the flat keys of the Curve 9360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece and the status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Curve 9320 features the microUSB port for charging and sync, as well as one of the convenience keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right are the other convenience key and volume rocker. By default the convenience key is set to launch the camera and serve as a dedicated shutter key. Portrait is the default orientation for taking pictures with the BlackBerry Curve 9320, and a shutter key placed low on the side makes little sense. It's a fixed focus camera anyway, so the trackpad will do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small dedicated pause/mute button is placed between the volume Up and Down keys. In the music player, you skip tracks by a long press of the volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the Lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom there's the speaker grille and microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the BlackBerry Curve 9320 features the 3 megapixel camera lens accompanied by the single LED flash. The lens is well recessed and reasonably protected against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the 1450 mAh Li-Ion battery. The SIM card slot is located underneath the battery. The back cover of the Curve 9320 is a rather thin piece of plastic that bends unpleasantly when pressed. The battery underneath is the respectable 1450 mAh and is rated at over 430 hours of standby and up to 7 hours of talk time. We can't help the thought that RIM is being too cautious after numerous complaints with the battery life of the Curve 9360 and its 1000 mAh unit. The Curve can be reasonably expected to do way better, considering the larger battery and lower resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the BlackBerry Curve 9320 through our dedicated battery test and found it to have a good, but not great endurance rating of 34h. Web browsing and video playback numbers aren't that great, but the 9320 met and exceeded the rated 7 hours of talk time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for the Curve 9320, RIM has decided to go back to a QVGA screen, and one with only 56K colors at that. It's a disappointment considering the BlackBerry Curve 9360 released last August featured a HVGA+ screen with 16M colors. Nevertheless, what's basically a rather poor screen in terms of resolution and contrast managed above average viewing angles and outdoor legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out its performance in our traditional display tests in the below. More information on our display test is available here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 is a nice phone to look at and handle. Ergonomically, it is sized right, and texting can be done comfortably with either one or both hands. If you have larger fingers, then it might not be as easy for you to hit the keys, as they use relatively limited space on a fairly compact handset. That being said, their tactile response is very good, so you definitely know when you're pressing something. Apart from the smudge-prone back panel, the phone is excellently compact and business-like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page, we take a look at the BlackBerry OS 7.1 software package on the Curve 9320.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Version 7.1 is the most recent update to the BlackBerry OS, and was released in the beginning of 2012. It will most likely be the last revision by RIM before the anticipated BB10, which means that the software on the 9320 will likely not receive any major updates and only the occasional bug-fix. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 runs on a less-powerful 806MHz processor than the Bold 9900 and the Torch 9860, but it is enough to handle the OS glitch-free. We experienced no slowdowns or freezes while working with the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick UI video of the BlackBerry Curve 9320:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7.1 doesn't bring any profound changes over 7.0. The Wi-Fi hotspot capability is the biggest - and most welcome - addition. The rest are minor tweaks to functionality that was already there for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Version 7.1 tries to look like the QNX-based Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - changes to the functionality are kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has quick toggles for cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It also gives you quick access to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7.1 is voice search enabled, too - clicking on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it. Also, on the homescreen you can initiate a search by just typing something on the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. The 'All' tab is the default one, which displays all icons. For convenience, you can sort some of your apps to the Favorite tab. The most frequently used apps are auto-generated in yet another tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Media and Download (for the apps you have downloaded yourself) sections for even more ways of sorting your apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 has a menu button located just to the left of the trackpad, which provides additional options which are usually not displayed on the main interface. These include the ability to close a given application, or adjust settings in application-specific contextual menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contacts in the phonebook get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities to get displayed when checking out their details. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Curve 9320 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has both voice and smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Curve 9320 is a solid performer, with no voice quality or reception issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives the Curve 9320 some extra points however is the Smart dial feature. Indeed that was our preferred way of locating contacts on the handset - you just punch a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggested names is promptly returned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then select them with the trackpad to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 scored an Below Average mark in our traditional loudspeaker test. Here's how it stacks up against the competition:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email with a BIS plan<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A BlackBerry Internet Service account is mandatory if you want to use email on the Curve 9320. And while we understand the advantages of BIS, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know - you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn't forget that not every carrier worldwide is offering BIS, which reduces the Curve 9320's reach. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its merit over the years. By today's standards, however, it does seem a bit dated when compared to its Android counterpart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 handles SMS, MMS messages as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. The latter turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with a convenient QWERTY keyboard, the Curve 9320 is great at its main job - texting. Some visual improvements would've been welcome, but getting the job done is what really matters here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player is functional but old-school<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>RIM refreshed the Music Player icons when BlackBerry OS 7 was released, but that's basically all they did. The styling is still pretty conservative, while most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's quick search of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Custom playlists are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. While pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, what's missing is an indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 did quite well in our audio quality test. In the active external amplifier part, the smartphone produced some excellent scores and while its volume levels didn't impress, it still performed very well overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, there's was very little degradation when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Some intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk crept in, but the levels remained way better than most other smartphones out there (including some way more expensive than the Curve 9320).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Curve 9320 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Curve 9320 played almost everything we threw at it, with the exception of 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape screen is a good start, and the video player itself isn't bad either. Its styling might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there. There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key, along with a dedicated fit/zoom to screen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 video player is said to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It managed to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, and WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either. Xvid videos with the AC3 audio codec played, but had no sound - while some Xvid videos refused to play altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery copy-pasted from OS 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid mode or viewed as a standard list. There's search by name here too, but unless you take the time to name all of the pictures you take, that's not really an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can only be browsed in landscape mode, with the option to manually rotate them. Unfortunately the Curve 9320 has no built-in accelerometer to provide automatic rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery - you just flick your finger over the trackpad and you can quickly browse through a slew of images. We were really impressed at the responsiveness of this gesture, as there's no delay while the hardware catches up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Checking an image's properties, applying zoom, as well as starting a slide show, are all a menu key click away. Setting one of your images as a homescreen wallpaper is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are zooming and panning. It would have been nice to use the volume rocker as a zoom lever, but the gallery is generally pretty good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor 3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 comes with a fixed-focus 3 megapixel camera which takes some pretty low quality shots, even for a small sensor. Close range shots don't come out well for the lack of autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. What's even worse is that the bar at the bottom covers a part of the frame, making proper framing really hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also pretty uncomfortable, considering that you do most of your shooting with the Curve 9320 in portrait mode. Most of the time you'll use the trackpad to snap a picture, which works fine, although at times you'll accidentally select something besides the shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Curve 9320. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Curve 9320 is pretty bad - the dynamic range is poor and the colors are hued towards the blue spectrum. The amount of resolved detail is about par for the sensor, although there is a fair amount of noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples taken with the Curve 9320.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've also added the BlackBerry Curve 9320 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. Here, you can see how it stacks up against other 3 megapixel (and higher) shooters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   BlackBerry Curve 9320 in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 records VGA videos at 30 fps and the camcorder's user interface is pretty much the same as on the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is about what you'd expect from VGA resolution - low amount of resolved detail, although the color reproduction is much better than on the still camera. The frame rate is good, while the audio records on a single channel at 64Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a VGA video sample from the Curve 9320 camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 gives you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect in a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the tri-band 3G with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The Wi-Fi b/g/n support is another nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections, as well as providing the ability to enable Wi-Fi hotspot. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that doubles as a data connection and charging port. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser, but on small screen and with no Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Curve 9320 is certainly functional, if you can live with the small screen and lack of Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start using the trackpad, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen. Multiple tabs are supported and switching between them is pretty easy - just tap on the tabs key at the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow works like a charm, and other than the missing Flash support, the handset provides a good browsing experience despite its smallish display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business ethos, the Curve 9320 has superb time-management capabilities. Its organizer includes a decent set of applications and although some of them are hardly lookers, their usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and lets you easily set up customized events. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but sadly the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Documents to Go pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the alarm tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the standard functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Password Keeper app, as well as one for voice recording, and a Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Curve 9320 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal, although there are a fair amount of apps available for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage your apps on a computer or directly on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest releases. In general there's hardly anything to complain about in terms of interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn't as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just under 100000 apps (about 25% of which are optimized for the PlayBook tablet. RIM claims that many developers are returning to BBOS development now that BB10 is on the horizon, but it's got a long way to go before it can reach the number of apps available for iOS and Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps works only with a BIS plan<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Curve 9320 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. It is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them in every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map with a few clicks. That rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been quite a while since we last reviewed a BlackBerry handset. Android and iOS have dominated the market for the past couple of years and it's hard to see where exactly a business-centric QWERTY device can fit in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, it's hard to ignore the fact that BlackBerrys still have a following - the Curve 9320's high daily interest at the time of writing is a testament to that. And so is RIM's own dedication to improving their operating system from the ground up with the almost complete overhaul that is BB10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not BlackBerry 10 will be enough to bring them back into contention is a tough call at this point, but for now we have to look at what exactly the BlackBerry Curve 9320 brings to the table. There are several factors which make the 9320 a really hard sell, not only in terms of what it offers but also in regards to what else is out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry phones have never been about flashy graphics or powerful processors, so the Curve 9320's mediocre specs are forgivable - to an extent. The 65K-color display measures less than 2.5 inches, and while that's not a negative in itself, it's perplexing why RIM chose to make it only 320 x 240 pixels, especially considering it has included better displays in the past. While the 800Mhz processor provides enough power to smoothly run the OS, it is pretty low for today's midrange standards, as is the 3 MP camera. Even some entry level devices on other platforms are offering better specs these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The operating system and price are two more things the Curve 9320 has going against it. With the upcoming BB10 being such a complete overhaul, it's unlikely that the 9320 will ever get it. And seeing as how RIM are betting the bank on BB10 and on attracting new customers, it's doubtful that there will be much support to its version 7.1 which already hasn't seen an upgrade for over half a year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which brings us to the Curve's price point. Currently, the BlackBerry Curve 9320 is available for around ?220, which is about in tune with what RIM would price an "entry level" device at. The BlackBerry Curve 9360, released exactly one year ago, offers a 480 x 360 resolution, 16M color screen of the same size, a 5 MP camera, and is almost 2 mm thinner than the 9320. It also runs the same BBOS version 7.1, and is available for around ?260.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you don't have your heart set on a BlackBerry, there are plenty of other QWERTY messenger offerings. The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro was released late last year as one of the last models to come from the Sony Ericsson partnership, and has a spec sheet that simply blows the Curve 9320 away. It has a 3.7 inch screen of 480 x 854 pixels resolution, a 1 GHz processor, 8MP camera capable of 720p video recording, front-facing VGA camera, and a complimentary 8 GB microSD card. Best of all, it runs Android and it even received its due ICS serving. The Xperia pro can currently be found for right around ?200.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC also have a reasonably-equipped QWERTY messenger droid. For around ?180, the HTC ChaCha gives you a 2.6 inch HVGA screen covered in Gorilla Glass, a 5 MP camera alongside VGA front-facer, powered by an 800Mhz processor. Unlike the Xperia pro, though, the Gingerbread-running ChaCha is not upgradable to ICS.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy Y Pro from Samsung has a spec sheet that is very similar to the BlackBerry Curve 9320. There's the same QVGA resolution display, an 832 Mhz processor, and 3MP camera. It only offers video recording at QVGA@24fps, however, and the measly 160 MB of inbuilt memory. There's the notable addition of Android 2.3 to keep in mind, and there's also a dual-SIM variant available. The Galaxy Y Pro can be had for around ?160.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Curve 9320 is not a bad phone in its own right. It offers an established, functional platform with a no-fuss interface alongside elegant styling. However, at the midrange price point, there are simply better-equipped devices to be had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if it were priced lower, the Curve 9320 would still be a hard sell in a market obsessed with touchscreen. RIM has obviously realized that, and has invested highly into recreating their own platform along those lines. It's anyone's guess whether the company will be more successful in its second venture away from its established territory (after the Storms fiasco), and whether we're seeing the slow death of QWERTY-enabled devices as we know them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Curve 9320 is not the last of its species perhaps and definitely not the worst. There's plenty of people who still want a proper phone - meaning one with buttons and such. They would love a neat and to-the-point QWERTY messenger with secure email. But RIM seems to be less and less interested in that kind of users and in their game plan the Curve 9320 is probably nothing more than a stopgap, a device designed to buy more time for the development of BB10.</paragraph>
