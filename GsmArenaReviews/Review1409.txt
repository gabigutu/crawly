			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few months ago, the original Desire was teaching younger Droids the ropes. Though it's no time to retire just yet, the next generation is ready to take over. And we're talking no rookie here - the new Desire Z means business with a great QWERTY keyboard and Froyo. The two phones don't even look distantly related but the Desire genes and the bumped up specs bode well for the droid messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Androids are friendly creatures in general but you might want to be careful with a metal-clad QWERTY messenger. We've come to expect solid build quality and premium finish from HTC and the Desire Z is ready to deliver. Another thing to watch for is new S-LCD screen. Froyo is a promise for a major performance boost and the latest Sense is also in the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have quite a flair for Android phones. Another thing they're good at is QWERTY messengers. Not that we've seen much proof lately but let's hope it's like riding a bike. If they're good at Android and if they haven't completely lost the messenger knack, a win should be in the bag for the HTC Desire Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been over a year since we had the pleasure of an HTC QWERTY messenger. You probably remember that the first of the droids came with a QWERTY keyboard. We guess it was only a matter of time for HTC to eventually get back to phones such as the G1, or even the the TyTN and the Touch Pro. Well, it's finally time for the new droid generation to get its own Pro. The HTC Desire Z is reporting for duty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks like we're ready to get to business too. Our tour starts right after the break with unboxing and hardware inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny box of the HTC Desire Z has enough room for a USB charger, a standard microUSB data cable and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a one-piece headset too with music controls. The supplied headphones aren't your only option though, since the Desire has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An 8GB microSD card is also enclosed. Sadly, there's no carrying pouch in the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire Z 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 3.7" screen, a full four-row hardware keyboard and rather free-handed use of metal, the HTC Desire Z easily tips the scales at the impressive 180 grams. At 119 x 60.4 x 14.2 mm, it is definitely not a piece to just slip in a pocket and forget about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we are not saying the weight is entirely a bad thing. The Desire Z has good balance and a solid and reliable feel that we really like. 180 grams will probably be too much for some users but it's definitely something we're willing to live with - as long as we get solid and durable finish and handling that's still comfortable enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z doesn't look much like the original Desire. In fact, there seems to be more of the Google Nexus One in it. The overall styling feels just the right bit more chiseled and angular. Having just reviewed the Desire HD - recycling an old design is not the way to get us impressed. In the case of the Desire Z, we're glad to report it's got a distinct and easily recognizable face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quality materials and strong build are traditional HTC values, to which the Desire Z remains faithful. Well, for the most part anyway. The phone's key design element - the Z hinge - is perhaps the most questionable too. But we'll get there in due time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metallic front frame and battery cover both have a soft brushed feel. The rest of the surface is rubbery and very pleasant to the touch. The phone's body (save for the screen obviously) is slow to take fingerprints and thanks to the light-color finish even when it does eventually get greasy, smudges are hard enough to notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new S-LCD unit is a solid performer indoors although the contrast is decent at best. The sunlight legibility however was a bit of a letdown. Indeed the Desire Z beats the regular LCD of the Desire HD in the bright sun by a whisker but it's no match for SuperAMOLED or Retina screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, yesterday we did have a hiccup with falsely identifying the Desire HD's screen as an S-LCD unit but you can reast assured that's the only thing we got wrong about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z's screen is indeed superior to Desire HD's (it's fair to note that the pixel density is in the Desire Z's favor) but by a small margin. The S-LCD screen has better contrast, slightly more saturated colors and superior viewing angles compared to regular LCD. But it falls obviously short of SuperAMOLED - and even Retina - in terms of both contrast and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to screen sensitivity, the Desire Z reacts to the gentlest taps thanks to the capacitive technology. The touch sensitivity is so high that it sometimes detects your finger from a few millimeters as you're just about to touch it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Android controls (back, contextual menu, Home and search) are right below the display. They're capacitive controls - and the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical trackpad is underneath, and outside the touchscreen. It can be used to scroll both menus and lists, and it even lets you select items and launch apps. But it's not essential really. The touchscreen is more than enough to get you around the interface. The trackpad can come in useful for jumping links on a webpage and that's probably it. We really couldn't find a better use of this control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only find the earpiece and two embedded sensors (proximity and ambient light). There is also a hidden status LED under the earpiece grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the HTC Desire Z open reveals one of its key features - the four-row full QWERTY keyboard. Before we get to the sweet four rows of buttons, a word on the actual form-factor. The Desire Z is a slider for the lack of a better term. It's more of a lift and pivot motion - the upper half gets raised on the Z-hinge before softly dropping into place. It's unlike the HTC G1 mechanism and in fact it's unlike anything we've seen so far by any manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The initial slide requires quite a bit of a push - but surprisingly once you get past the folding point it drops rather flimsily. The worst part is it doesn't really lock into position. You can't help but feel the hinge being too soft - almost fragile. Maybe it's just making the wrong impression, but we do fear the hinge getting worse with use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our fears aside, upon sliding it up, the screen automatically rotates to landscape orientation. And the fun starts. The brilliant keyboard has great ergonomics, well spaced buttons with excellent press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row layout is of great help here: the keys are big enough to handle comfortably. Two Function keys and two Shift buttons (one under each thumb) are more than welcome. There are even two user-configurable keys. The top, which accommodates numbers too (no numpad layout here) is very easy to access, with more than enough headroom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC Desire Z features a long and thin volume rocker next to a microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right is the dedicated camera key and the battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock key. At the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z rear hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens and the tiny loudspeaker grill. There is a LED flash next to the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover will pop softly up as soon as you squeeze the latch to reveal the 1300 mAh battery . The thing to note is the microSD card slot is under the battery so it's not hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z is quoted at 9 hours and 50 minutes of talk time or 430 hours in stand-by in a 2G network (that's scaled down to 6 hours and 40 minutes of calls and 430 hours of stand-by in 3G mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality we would just squeeze one day of heavy use out of it - an hour of internet browsing, some music and video playback, 30min of gaming, 30min of using the camera and a couple of hours of getting to know the phone's interface. Basically the 3.7" screen was pretty much constantly on. We guess once you get to know your new toy you can even et two days of battery life out of it under moderate use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is a solid business messenger and it looks it. The finish is excellent and the build quality is nearly perfect. The only suspicious element is the Z hinge - and we're not even completely sure whether it's the feel we don't like or it really is weaker than it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the phone is just right - given the 3.7" screen and the exceptional QWERTY keyboard. It's a heavy phone by any standard but well balanced and comfortable to hold and operate. It looks mature and to-the-point and has lots of personality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New HTC Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Android ? v2.2 Froyo is an important change on its own too, as we?re about to see in the benchmark section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z however also comes with the newest version of the HTC Sense user interface for Android ? we already saw it in our HTC Desire HD review ? now it?s time to see how it fits the smaller screen. We?ll also see how it handles on a slower CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our video starting with a demo of the fast system booting:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there are three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu. The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Personalize" menu. The way to place stuff on the screen has slightly changed but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z has the Leap view option: upon a tap or a pinch, it zooms out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. With a press and hold you can rearrange the homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreens is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense UI offers Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are now selected from a fancy-looking 3D card interface but other than that, their functionality is mostly unchanged. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes from the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch to a list. In the list layout, there?s an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster. It?s similar to what you used to see in TouchFLO on older HTC WinMo phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set, which is a sound theme of sorts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (HTC and Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreens short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. The Twitter widget for instance ? one version shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet, while the other version is more compact but only lets you tweet from the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things that have changed is the notification area ? it now features a list of recent apps, just like a task switcher. A press and hold on the Home button works too. Maybe some people will use the notification area as the easier way to switch apps, but we would have preferred some quick switches for Wi-Fi, GPS, etc. rather than duplicated functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC haven?t really had a long record of QWERTY-enabled Androids. Still, some work has been done to improve the experience. For one, there?s a landscape mode for the homescreen and main menu and there are two customizable shortcuts on the hardware keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks of the HTC Desire Z vs. the original Desire. The Desire is clocked at 1GHz but was still running Android 2.1 Eclair when we tested it. The Desire Z on the other hand has been downclocked to 800MHz but is running the much faster Android 2.2 Eclair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are about equal at graphics and the Desire Z?s memory score is lower ? but check out that CPU score and speed in BenchmarkPi. The Desire Z is much faster despite its 20% lower clock speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Desire Z has no performance issues. And the benchmarks are indicative of just how important it is for a phone to get updated to Froyo ? it?s as good as a CPU upgrade. The actual CPU upgrade of the Desire Z also helps for its high benchmark scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One last thing ? HTC have done some magic and the Desire Z boots extremely fast. In fact, it takes more time to press and hold the power key than for the phone to boot. Note that if you take out the battery, the Desire Z will have to do the regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s slightly annoying that you have to let go of the power key before the phone would boot ? so you have to guess if the press has been long enough (it vibrates only after you let go of the key). Still, it?s pretty cool that apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before shutting of the phone, launching the browser after you start it up again brings you to the same page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC has used some sort of Suspend or Hibernate mode as seen on regular computers to do the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>We love this phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z features the same powerful phonebook we first saw on the Hero. It features heavy social networking integration and manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs and you're just viewing the first tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it held the entire conversation, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs is what really turns the Desire Z into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your friends? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen features no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy ? just press the search button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull out your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Desire Z. The Transfer Data app supports many phones from major manufacturers and pulls the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the in-call sound quality is crisp and loud, we did experience some reception issues with the HTC Desire Z. Sometimes it would fail to place a call or gets disrupted audio in areas of weaker signal (though not that weak).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). Smart Dialing is enabled and you can use the alphabet scroll too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphabet scroll has an interesting change: it puts the Recent calls and Favorite contacts just before the contacts starting with A. This has consequences on contact ordering ? if you?ve recently called Dexter, he won?t show up under ?D?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm. You can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down. Another feature that works thanks to the accelerometer is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not stop). Another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is enabled on The HTC Desire Z ? just press and hold the search key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy app is the Blocked Callers app ? it lets you block certain callers (you can pick from the recent call list or the phonebook) and remove blocked callers from the list. It?s a simple but potentially very useful utility ? some Nokia Eseries phones have a similar app, though it has more options (e.g. redirects, only blocked during certain hours, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very handy feature is that when someone calls, their latest Tweet or Facebook update will show up ? possibly reminding you what the caller wants. You can see how that can be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the HTC Desire Z scored Very Good. Here is how it ranks among some other handsets we?ve tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging powerhouse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is well equipped for all kinds of text messaging ? it can handle all standard types of messages like SMS, MMS and email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Android phones, if you only have one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the messaging menu is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages use the threaded layout ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the time of the last message, including a part of the actual note. Tapping a conversation brings up another list ? the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses contact photos too (yours and the contact?s photo), so the whole thing looks almost the same as a chat app. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box used to be a major annoyance ? it only fits one or two lines and you can see only a small portion of what you were typing. On the HTC Desire Z, the box is much bigger ? especially in landscape mode where it takes half the screen. Composing messages is much more comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection has become very iPhone-like ? and that?s a compliment. When you press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements. Text selection works the same way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app, which looks the same as usual, and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, there are several tabs that can filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand (they are not automatically loaded by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Desire Z lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a hardware QWERTY keyboard, the email and messaging apps will likely see a lot of use. And it?s a good keyboard ? it?s wide so you can easily type with both thumbs without getting them tangled and keys are nicely sized and spaced.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is the same, likes to share<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a figure indicating the number of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, one for Flickr. These two display images from either account or those posted by your friends. And finally, the Connected media button lets you pull multimedia content from a DLNA-enabled server (your PC with Windows Media Player will do just fine).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo from the HTC Desire Z is very easy ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. Direct posting of videos on YouTube is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Desire Z image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip layout (flip the phone horizontally and the accelerometer will take care of the rest). You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire Z supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does HD in DivX<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed from the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. The video files can be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface on the HTC Desire Z is quite basic. There?s a full screen mode, where the clip gets stretched / cropped to fit the screen and you can scrub through the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player did well to handle most DivX and XviD videos we tested ? it only choked on a single DivX video of 720p resolution. Other HD videos ran problem-free. The high-res screen has 15:9 aspect ratio ? so cropping 16:9 videos to fullscreen cuts out very little and the overall viewing experience is very good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Songs and Connected media (which handles DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs or go back. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. From the context menu, you can share a song (over Bluetooth, email or message) and you can look up the music video too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily recognizes a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free version however limits you to just 5 recognitions per month.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS, starts slowly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a bit annoying that it takes 5-6 seconds to start but other than that the radio app is very good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlikethe Desire HD, the HTC Desire Z did very well in our audio quality test. It achieved some excellent scores when you use it as audio source for external amplifiers (such as a car or home stereo), rivaling some of the best handsets we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And things aren't much worse when you plug in a pair of headphones. As usual the stereo crosstalk and the intermodulation distortion increase, but still remain respectable. The dynamic range and frequency response are also slightly affected but the differences are mostly detectable in lab conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire Z frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5 megapixel snapper is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592&#x445;1944 pixels. While premium Android handsets are already on the 8MP notch, the Desire Z is content to offer good resolution for still images and 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is new and has received some fun options. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom slider on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z features touch focus and face detection; geotagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One neat trick is continuous autofocus ? the camera will focus, even if you haven?t half-pressed the shutter key, so that when you do the focus is found much faster. When you move the Desire Z and point it somewhere else it will focus again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other kinds of effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time. Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can bring out the extended settings menu by pressing the menu key. Face detection is supported. It?s enabled in self-portrait mode too ? you can set it to focus on 1 or 2 faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality of the photos, we have to say it?s not really the best we?ve seen. There?s plenty of noise, which automatic noise reduction struggles to keep in check (smudging the fine detail as it goes along). Sharpening on the other hand, tries to deal with the resulting softness but does produce some artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can judge the camera from the samples below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video stutters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire Z manages 720p videos at 25 fps but unfortunately it has its downsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 3GP files, which is less than ideal. The amount of captured detail is OK and the videos aren?t over-compressed. However, they exhibited a painful stutter ? the video would freeze for up to a second at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried it with several different video players (including playing the video on the phone) but the stutter is there ? and sometimes even more artifacts show up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reality is much less impressive than what the specs look on paper ? we were rather disappointed. Here goes a sample 720p@25fps video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well-geared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is a connectivity master. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is a given, and the dual-band 3G is blazing fast ? 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in the microUSB cable you?re presented with a long list of options. The basics are Charge only, Disk drive (connects the microSD card as a mass storage drive) and HTC Sync for connecting to HTC?s PC suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more options however ? USB tethering, which shares the phone?s data connection (and that fast HSPA makes it a great modem for a laptop), while the other option ? Internet pass-through ? does just the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot ? Android 2.2 Froyo has Wi-Fi tethering built-in, but this app is actually more powerful. It can connect 1 to 8 devices (default app maxes out at 5) and you can set the maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can encrypt the hotspot with WEP, WPA or WPA2 and you can enable only ?allowed users? to connect or leave it open for anything (unsecure, but the quickest setup). You can set the app to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery if you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great Flash-enabled web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid web browsing has been an inherent part of the Android deal since day one. And version 2.2 Froyo is the fastest yet ? and then there?s the Flash 10.1 capability, which really opens up the Web (which for better or for worse still relies heavily on Flash for video streaming and navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the refresh button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Z browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which make it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out yet more options ? anything from finding on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to further sweeten the deal, HTC Desire Z has Flash support in its web browser. Even though the CPU is downclocked, YouTube videos played quite smoothly. We tried out a few games from the mobile section of Kongregate and found quite a few Flash games that worked very well in the browser (and are optimized for touch control).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say what you will about Flash, but still most video streaming and game sites use it ? so it?s a major advantage for a browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.1 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A fine organizer on board, office doc editor included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z comes with the usual set of organizing apps with the added advantage of a document editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the Quickoffice app, which has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. All the apps work fast, despite the downclocked CPU, but editing complex documents gets slow at times. With the hardware QWERTY keyboard, editing documents is actually possible however ? on-screen keyboards just take up too much space, leaving you with little room to edit something that was meant to be viewed on a computer screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a Word document, you get plenty of formatting options (more than you get on Windows Phone 7). You get text effects (italic, bold, etc.), you can change the font and its size, color and highlight (from a color picker, not just 3 pre-selected colors like in WP7).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when you tap Format you get a long list with all the options in it ? usable but not quite user friendly. You can?t create tables or lists either. The situation with spreadsheets is similar ? enough features, but not presented in the most user-friendly way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally, enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Desire Z into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which allow you to update your profiles on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also came preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (both are very good, so whichever one you choose will do fine). They integrate with the phonebook, so you can read your friends? tweets from there, no need to launch the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two handy search apps Quick lookup and Search Anywhere. Quick lookup lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary. The Search Anywhere app is a universal in-phone search that covers anything ? from settings and messages to songs and videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is running the latest available version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps , which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the rest of the apps, you can scroll down. To make discovering apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market, but each one comes with an HTC review. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Desire Z contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Desire Z in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy (we tried it in Firefox 3.6.12), so if you?re stuck with Internet Explorer it will feel sluggish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation gets some help from TomTom, Route66<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in just over two minutes (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But HTC recently made an interesting announcement ? the Desire HD and the Desire Z will come with HTC Places, a collaboration with TomTom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What HTC Locations can do is let you download maps for countries for free, or just cache maps as you browse. Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you stray from your course and don?t have a data connection Gmaps can?t do anything, which might be a problem. No such problems with Locations though ? that distinction makes all the difference when traveling abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing we found interesting ? when HTC announced Locations, they said they were collaborating with TomTom. But when we started the app we saw Route66 flash on the screen ? it turns out the software is by Route66, while TomTom contributed the maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The car panel offers big, easy to hit buttons so that you don?t get too distracted while driving. A handy option is ?mark this location? ? great for those who often forget where they parked their car.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been over a year since HTC gave us a QWERTY messenger. But they still have it in them obviously. The Desire Z is a solid smartphone package with premium finish and a keyboard to be proud of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the hardware is just one side of the coin. With the latest Android v2.2 Froyo inside and the updated HTC Sense UI (with remote services via HTCSense.com), there is hardly anything missing. They?ve even added Xvid and DivX video support (about time, really) ? not to mention the HTC exclusive fast boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of smart messengers out there, but only two of them enjoy Android Froyo ? the Motorola MILESTONE 2 and the Samsung Galaxy 551.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 costs about the same as the HTC Desire Z and offers a similar set of features. In case you?re undecided about those two, we guess you?ll have to pick the right interface for you ? HTC Sense or MOLOBLUR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 will be about 130 euro cheaper and that?s fair we guess: it doesn?t have the fast processor, the high-res screen or the storage space. It?s expected to be released this month, so if the Galaxy 551 catches your eye you?ll have to wait a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy 551</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking for Droid messengers further afield, the fancy Motorola BACKFLIP and the smallish Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro are some options to consider too. Both handsets are at least half the price of the Desire Z and feature good mid-range specs. The BACKFLIP?s biggest problem is the outdated Android 1.5 OS, which is already due for an E'clair release but only stateside. The X10 mini pro has already been updated to 2.1 Eclair (worldwide), but it will probably never get Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola BACKFLIP ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a full hardware keyboard is your next phone?s key ingredient, we?d better step outside Android and broaden the search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at Symbian, we find the Nokia C6-00 and the Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro. Both phones cost about 230-250 euro and have great messaging and solid imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C6-00 ? Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the Symbian high-end, the Nokia E7 is emphatically in charge. It should be released around the end of the year, on the same OS as the bestselling N8 ? Symbian^3. There is no word on pricing yet, but it shouldn?t be more expensive than the Desire Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before we run the credits, there is one more phone that comes to mind ? the HTC 7 Pro. It looks much like the Desire Z and has matching specs but it runs Microsoft?s latest Windows Phone 7. It?s yet to be released, but its pre-order price tag is about 600 euro, which is at least 70 euro more than the Desire Z. But then again, if you are into trying out WP7 with a QWERTY control board, you?ll have to wait a few weeks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC 7 Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo is a natural fit for the Desire Z hardware and delivers excellent user experience. The Sense gets better with every new release and continues to be one of the best custom UIs to date. The Desire Z also offers a great QWERTY keyboard, HD video recording and extensive video codec support. It looks like a great package and sure acts like one most of the time.</paragraph>
