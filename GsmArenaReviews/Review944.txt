			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM devices are almost exclusively a money-conscious affair and the Samsung Galaxy Core sticks to the playbook. It's just that when you look to optimize you monthly mobile spending by taking advantage of two different contracts, you don't usually want to spend big on a high-end smartphone and look for value-for-money offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its sub-&#x20ac;200 price tag the Samsung Galaxy Core, which also comes in single-SIM flavor, still offers a dual-core CPU, very reasonable 217ppi screen and a 5MP camera, as well as a styling reminiscent of the Galaxy S4 flagship. And it's all squeezed in a 9mm slim body, which while no longer impressive in the higher market tiers is quite the feature with entry level smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android version is charge of the Samsung Galaxy Core is also very respectful - 4.1 Jelly Bean is basically as good as it gets in this price range. It should keep things nicely smooth thanks to its Project Butter Optimizations and it's easily more functional than Windows Phone 8, which is the main Android rival in the lower market segments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The spec sheet is often louder than words so check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the dual-SIM smartphone market is no longer the wasteland it was a couple of years ago, so the Samsung Galaxy Core will face some stiff competition. Devices like the HTC Desire 600 or Sony's Xperia M are ready to take advantage of any chinks in the Galaxy Core armor and when you read the fine print you realize there are quite a few those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU core count and clock speed are quite nicely sounding, but its Cortex-A5 nature certainly puts a big question mark over the performance. And while we have seen some pretty good 5MP snappers from Samsung this particular one fails quite miserably on the video front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again it's not about setting benchmark or pixel density records in these parts of the market. What matters here is that least corners are cut and the smartphone performance is well balanced. Those are the two things we are about to test right now - join us after the break as we give the Galaxy Core a thorough hardware examination.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What's in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes in a tiny box, which like recent Samsung devices is made from recycled materieals. In the box itself, aside from the usual leaflets, you get a headset with a microphone and volume controls, a standalone A/C adapter and a microUSB cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Core 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core measures 129.3 x 67.6 x 9 mm and weighs 124 g. It's not the most space-efficient design and Samsung could've crammed a little more than 4.3 inches by reducing the bezels, but the phone still feels pretty comfortable to hold.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core follows the same design language Samsung has been using since the Galaxy S III come around. The phone has rounded edges and there's an aluminum-acting plastic rim going around its sides. The front is covered in glass, while the plastic back is removable, allowing you to replace the battery if needed and enabling memory expansion without extra flaps on the rims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung once again has opted for glossy plastics and they're pretty easily smudged and before while it will be close to impossible to clean the Galaxy Core. However we can see the appeal of using lower cost materials as they're both cheaper to produce and later on cheaper to replace should you scuff the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is pretty consistent when it comes to designing its phones and although they don't scream high-end most of the time there's no denying they're built well and with ease of use in mind. All the buttons are placed where you'd want them to be and you get the unobtrusive three button layout without losing screen estate. So while the design is certainly pretty tired by know and in desperate need of a refresh, we wouldn't take any points away from the Galaxy Core here - it's practicality that matters more in value-for-money handsets like this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core control layout is business as usual, the smartphone sharing its button configuration with vitually all recent Samsung smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is reserved for the 4.3" TFT display of WVGA (480 x 800) resolution. Under it lie the two capacitive back and menu keys as well as the physical home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece, next to it the proximity sensor and the front-facing VGA camera. There's no ambient light sensor here. The bezels around the screen are rather wide, which is especially evident on the white unit we have here in the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side holds the volume rocker, while the power button, used for locking and unlocking the device, rests comfortably under your thumb on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alone on the top sits the 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is where the lone microphone and the microUSB port are located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving over to the back of the phone we get a glance of the 5 MP camera lens, which is slightly protruding but the glass is embedded under a chrome accent rim so it's not too easy to scratch. On the right side of the camera lens sits the single LED flash, while the loudspeaker grille is located on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Samsung logo fixed in the center of the back panel. In order to remove the panel there's a tiny slit on the right side where you insert your nail and push out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the cover is removed you get to see the microSD card slot which is placed above the primary SIM port, the secondary SIM port, which is hot-swappable and the 1800 mAh battery. Samsung claims 500 hours of 2G stand-by and 300 hours in 3G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core we have on premises is the Duos variety, which sports dual stand-by. While that may lead you into thinking the battery endurance may falter you will be surprised. The Samsung Galaxy Core managed an endurance rating of 49 hours. That's the your expected interval between charges if conform to an hour of calling, web browsing and video playback a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core got almost 12 hours of talk time, almost 7 hours of web browsing and 7 and a half of video playback but most impressive was its stand-by time, which isn't much worse than many single-SIM smartphones we've tested. Check out more on the battery including a comparison of the Galaxy Core against the entire fleet of tested phones here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core is equipped with a 4.3" WVGA (480 x 800) TFT display, which is good for around 217 ppi. While it's far from the sharpest display around it's still good at arm's length. Colors come out good, but are nowhere near AMOLED levels and the screen falters when pit side by side with a Galaxy S4 mini, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is nothing out of the ordinary by LCD standards - a standard RGB matrix, although the pixels are slightly larger this time due to the relatively low density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the contrast the display of the Samsung Galaxy Core is rather lacking at both 50% and 100% brightness settings. Blacks aren't very deep but brightness is okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next test shows the display's contrast in bright light, indicating what kind of performance you can expect when you take the phone outside on a bright sunny day. The Samsung Galaxy Core posted a below average score - it's not the worst phone and you'll be able to operate it but you'll need to work a bit to find a proper angle.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nature UX at the helm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean out of the box, skinned with the TouchWiz overlay, dubbed Nature UX. Beyond the obvious benefits to the user experience compared to stock Android, the custom launcher also brings a few premium features borrowed for the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a brief video showing off the user interface here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" affair and there's a water-drop sound as you drag your finger - there are no ripples here though. There are a number unlock routines to choose from: motion, face and pattern among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're three customizable lockscreen shortcuts (down from five on the S III), and you can drag one to activate the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one always opens the app drawer, but the other four can be set to any shortcut or even a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is quite feature-rich and offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Bluetooth. You can swipe to the side to get even more: Mobile data, Blocking mode, Power saving and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the brightness slider (there's no automatic brightness toggle here though). There are also a couple of other useful things like the Settings shortcut in the upper right corner, the time/date to its left and the carrier name at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean, you get expandable notifications to get more info about them. They can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer accommodates both app shortcuts and widgets. Unlike stock Android, you cannot move between tabs by swipes - you have to explicitly hit the widget tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets takes some getting used to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes: a Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean comes with a selection of widgets, with some custom additions by Samsung. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is available natively in Jelly Bean. Widgets automatically move out of the way when you're reorganizing the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Jelly Bean-style vertical list with a thumbnail and a name for each app. A sideways swipe removes the app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three buttons at the bottom of the list - one to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager, one to launch Google Now and a 'Kill all apps' button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX on top of Android 4.1 looks great and the Galaxy Core does pack enough cool software tricks for its price. And despite its modest chipset, the Galaxy Core handles the heavy Samsung skin with surprising ease. It wouldn't choke on heavy live wallpapers either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung released S Voice as an answer to Siri before Google came out with its own solution in Google Now. S Voice is the culmination of Samsung's ongoing effort at integrating voice commands into the Android experience, an effort which goes back to the days of Vlingo. You may remember the voice activation (saying "Hi Galaxy" to trigger S Voice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can do the usual - search the web, make calls, send texts (which Android natively supports and so does Vlingo), but you can also use it instead of the notification area toggles, answer or reject incoming calls, start the camera and take a photo, control the music player and FM radio and stop or snooze alarms all with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also a tool for quickly looking up facts - it's powered by Wolfram Alpha (which handles some of Siri's answers too). It has an enormous database covering topics ranging from Culture and Media to Physics. S Voice can also be used as a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has decided to keep S Voice alongside Google's solution as the two do differ in functionality. Jelly Bean has the unspoken Google Now info cards, but it also brought Google's Knowledge Graph, which can answer factual questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Since the latest update came, Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core is built with the purpose of being light on the wallet and that includes skimping on a powerful chipset. The SoC in charge is the Snapdragon S4 Play and it features two 1.2 GHz Cortex-A5 cores alongside 1 GB of RAM and the Adreno 203 graphics processing unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi and Linpack focus on the chipset's processing abilities, testing single-core and multi-core performance respectively. Here the Cortex-A5s unexpectedly failed to impress.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 test out the CPU performance as well as memory performance. Here the Galaxy Core managed to come in last - far behind the quad-core Desire 600.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant are compound benchmark, giving the CPU, GPU and memory a run. The Galaxy Core outpaced the Galaxy Xcover 2 in this test but couldn't muster enough to match better spec'd competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 203 is among the lowest-powered GPUs around but it's still worth checking out what it can do in the big boys' benchmarks so here go the GLBenchmark Egypt 2.5 and T-Rex 2.7 in 1080p offscreen - meaning we test raw processing power, rather than real-life performance. As expected the Galaxy Core failed pretty miserably here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel is rendered on-screen meaning it also factors in screen resolution. The Samsung Galaxy Core offered a framerate that's borderline playable, suggesting it can't really handle heavier games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to JavaScript and HTML 5 performance. SunSpider gives JavaScript the rundown, BrowserMark 2 is HTML 5-focused while Vellamo centers on both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JavaScript performance was middling although it managed to surpass some more expensive droids, while HTML 5 performance was along the same lines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vellamo scores was in line with the rest of the web browsing benches.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Galaxy Core is far from a powerhouse. It will get the job done as long as you are not in a hurry, but don't expect to be impressed by its gaming performance or loading times. The smartphone does quite decently at browsing the web, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you should keep in mind that the devices atop the lists were, in each and every case, far more expensive so it's only natural that they would be superior in terms of hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has room for everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. There are four tabs on top accommodating the Phone app, Groups, Favorites and Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You cannot swipe between them like in stock Android and some other custom overlays like HTC Sense - you have to tap each tab separately. However Samsung has kept its own swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text (left swipe). The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap of the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all available details, across two tabs. The first one is the About tab, with the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. If the phonebook finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there're a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has even added a built-in reject list. You choose a specific vibration pattern too as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like in the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes any unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from those sources as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Samsung Galaxy Core is great - voices come in clear and in-call volume level is good. Reception is problem-free and we didn't suffer dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can initiate a call with either SIM card by pressing its corresponding button below the dial pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no direct call on the Galaxy Core, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card manager comprises of few options. You can enable the data connection for each SIM as well as rename it. You can toggle to receive calls on the SIM and to enable dual-SIM always on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Core. It managed a Good result. The speaker is loud and clear and it's not likely you'll miss a lot of phone calls. The vibration intensity is also great. More about our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box grows as much as it needs to - it can fill the entire screen (above the on-screen keyboard that is), growing to 10 lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule a message to be sent automatically at a later point in time. There's a list of all scheduled messages in case you need to cancel or send a message ahead of time manually. You can also mark certain numbers as "spam", in case some automatic promo texts get pushy, and lock messages to prevent their deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender against a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Core also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a sync schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, gesture and voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes with several text input options. You have the traditional QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode (which is a little cramped) and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right to switch between letters and symbols or you can enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like swiping your finger around but Continuous input isn't your thing, you can try using the handwriting recognition. It's quite accurate too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and, since the Core is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phone is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz gallery is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes with the TouchWiz flavor gallery. It opens up in Album view, which is what we're used to seeing. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the bottom of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, as well as customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Core will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize people automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with SoundAlive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Core employs the same TouchWiz-ed music player as with most droids in Samsung's lineup. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. The company also uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music is sorted into various categories and one of the options, called Music square, is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and places those tracks on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to skip songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've enabled the Motion gestures, you can mute and pause a track by placing the phone face down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Okay video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which lists DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no Pop up play on the Galaxy Core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three view modes for how the video fits the screen (fit to screen, fill screen, 100% resolution). The SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung droids usually have excellent video players, but this one wasn't quite up to par. It can't play 1080p videos,due to the limited chipset and lacks support for MKV files. It sticks to MP4 and AVI (and some XviD files didn't play smoothly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you tweak the viewing experience out of the screen by adjusting video brightness, Auto play next, play speed, SoundAlive and enable subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core did win some points for its subtitles support. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Core is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core showed decently clean output in the first part of our traditional audio quality test, posting some very good scores with the frequency response being the only exception. Unfortunately volume levels are below average, too, so it's only worth a good rather than excellent mark here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but it is barely noticeable outside of dedicated audio labs. The stereo crosstalk rises notably, but that's about it - the rest of the readings remain unchanged. Unfortunately, volume levels remain pretty low so the Galaxy Core simply confirms its first-part rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera not up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes with a 5MP camera that shoots stills at up to 2560 x 1920. It has an LED flash to assist it in low light scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on the Galaxy S III. On the right there's the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - its let you easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth shortcut always points to Settings. You can also move the icons around to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Core has an extensive set of features: touch focus, smile shot, continuous shot, panorama and can snap photos during video recording (but at only VGA resolution, basically a frame from the video). What's missing is HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core produces noisy images even in good lighting conditions. There's noise in the shadows and in solid color areas like the sky, windows, etc. Images have decent sharpness and contrast is decent, but dynamic range doesn't seem all that inspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Galaxy Core got the white balance right and produced overall nice colors. The camera is snappy to focus as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro performance was good but the Galaxy Core has a limited focus range. It wouldn't focus from under 10 cm. Here go the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core isn't among the best shooters we've seen in the 5 MP league. It's not too bad and will do in most cases when you just need to snap something quickly but will not produce a shot you'd like to hang up on your wall (or at least use as a wallpaper on your PC). Still considering the low price tag this kind of performance can be considered adequate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>D1 video recording disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface of the Galaxy Core is nearly identical to the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left with five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather disappointingly, Samsung Galaxy Core records video up to D1 (720x480 pixel) resolution. We've become accustomed to seeing at least 720p HD video recording from recent smartphones, so you'll excuse us if we are less than impressed with this kind of showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given their limited resolution, the video quality isn't too bad, but there's only so much detail you can put in a 720 x 480 pixel video. The framerate is smooth and the colors are nice, but better not watch the resulting videos on anything but the Galaxy Core's own 4.3" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded with 30 frames per second with a bitrate of around 3000 Kbps with sound recorded in mono at a 112 Kbps bitrate and 48 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched sample (480p@30fps, 13s) taken straight off the device itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core has the standard set of connectivity features - quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers b/g/n with hotspot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also stereo Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Core has a built-in A-GPS receiver that also works with GLONASS. With both global positioning systems, you get more satellites available, which improves lock times and accuracy both in the urban jungle and in an actual jungle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tweaked Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core has a tweaked version of the Jelly Bean Android browser, but Chrome also comes pre-installed, if that's what you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the default browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes with a number of cool apps preinstalled. The one glaring omission is an Office document editor - perhaps Samsung finally came to terms with the sheer amount of free office editors available on the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is easy to use with your fingers. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner app can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled its new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Core. It can sync contacts, calendar and S memos and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app features is laid out across five tabs, each with a different function. The first tab lets you create multiple alarms (each with a distinct repeat time and ring tone), then there are the World clock, stopwatch, timer and desk clock tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the phone horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app lets you browse all the files in your phones' memory or on an attached microSD card. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone, an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline caching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. You can pre-fetch maps on your device but the service isn't available for every country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy Core has access to the latest apps and the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Keep in mind though that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a sub-?200 price tag and a well-rounded set of features the Galaxy Core is a new smartphone arrive that will be welcomed by both money-conscious users looking to leverage on two plans to optimize their monthly cellphone spending (dual-SIM version) and those only now entering the smartphone game (single-SIM).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of reasons to consider the smartphone - the screen is decent, the camera is quite fine for the class and the smooth Android 4.1 Jelly Bean on board. But as this is quite a crowded part of the market, there are also many smartphones, who'd try and give you reasons to look the other way. Let's have a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Samsung Galaxy Core is very close to what you wanted, but no cigar, you should consider its Samsung Galaxy Win sibling. Costing slightly more than the Galaxy Core it brings a bigger 4.7" WVGA display to the table, quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A5 chip and matches the Galaxy Core on all other accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Win I8550</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While now a generation too old the Galaxy S III mini has a superior dual-core processor, a more capable 5 MP snapper and is also powered by Android 4.1. It's screen tips is just 4" in diagonal but retains the WVGA resolution. Sadly, the Galaxy S III mini lacks a dual-SIM version, so if that's what you are after you should move ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia M and Xperia L are perhaps the biggest threat to the Galaxy Core in the Android camp. Giving you a choice between 4" and 4.3" screens of the slightly higher FWVGA resolution, these two have far more capable dual-core Krait CPUs and Adreno 305 GPUs. You also get 720p video recording and, if you side with the Xperia L, an 8MP snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If one SIM is enough for you the Xperia M, Xperia L and the Galaxy Core are priced very similarly, making the Samsung smartphone a real outsider here. Yet if you want two SIMs in one smartphone, the Xperia L is out of the equation and the Xperia M price rises to far to be as easy a recommendation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia M ? Sony Xperia L</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you don't mind giving Windows Phone a try, you can get a handsome reward in the form of Nokia Lumia 620. Costing notably less than the Galaxy Core, that one packs a 3.8" WVGA ClearBlack screen, 5 MP camera and a dual-core Krait chip, giving you far better hardware for your money. However it lacks dual-SIM functionality, so it's can't compete with the Galaxy Core on all fronts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 620</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core gets a lot of things right and certainly gives you a decent smartphone at a bargain price tag. However, its single SIM version is priced to compete with smartphones far above its league, so it's really a smartphone we can't recommend to anyone at this point and price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM Galaxy Core version is where you should be focusing. Its price tag is far lower than anything with similar specs, and its specs are better than anything with a similar price tag. Sounds like the best recipe for entry-level success. ?</paragraph>
