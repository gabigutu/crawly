			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has deconstructed its best smartphone and put it back together into something amazing. The Xperia Z1 (codename Honami) is a powerful, camera-centric flagship backed up by the QX line of attachable camera modules and the SmartWatch 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 takes some of the highlights of the original Xperia Z - the gorgeous OmniBalance design, a 5" 1080p screen, water resistant body - and kicks everything else into overdrive. The major crowd puller is the 20.7MP camera with G Lens and big 1/2.3" sensor, but the display tech is new and improved and the Snapdragon 800 chipset is the current chart-topper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1/2.3" sensor is as big as what most point-and-shoots have, as well as the Samsung Galaxy Camera and Galaxy S4 zoom hybrids. True, it's smaller than Nokia's 1020 PureView imager, but Sony didn't compromise the build - the Xperia Z1 is 8.5mm thick throughout, there are no humps to hurt pocketability (and desirability).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today, top cameras are put on top phones and you pay for both. Plus, even the ones with impressive imaging credentials like the Xperia Z1 lack the optical zoom or stabilization of dedicated cameras, which on the other hand come short of features and apps, not to mention skimp on screen size and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enter the new QX line of lens-style cameras that allow you to enhance any smartphone with a 10x zoom or a large 1" sensor borrowed from Sony's acclaimed RX100 II camera. Each QX camera contains its own lens, image sensor and battery and uses NFC and Wi-Fi for pairing and communication with the phone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Blinking lights have performed notification duties for almost as long as there have been mobile phones. Color lights and active screens have allowed phones to communicate more information, but they still do nothing when the phone is in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the SmartWatch 2, Sony is continuing its push to make notifications richer and more accessible (it's always on your wrist), while at the same time allowing for more info to be displayed and giving you more controls, all in a single stylish package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SmartWatch 2 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year at IFA, Sony is reimagining the future - in the year 2013 you won't need to pull your phone out of your pocket to read a new message or pay the flagship premium just because you want a good camera. And if you do pay for the flagship, the Xperia Z1, you'll get the bleeding edge in smartphone tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page as we take the Xperia Z1 and its crew for a spin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony introduced new design aesthetics with the Xperia Z called OmniBalance and the Xperia Z1 brings the latest refinement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chassis of the 5" flagship is constructed out of a solid slab of aluminum that's extruded, carved and anodized. After all this, all that's left is the rectangular frame to which all the ports, slots and buttons are attached (including the trademark aluminum power button) and then two scratch-resistant sheets of glass are put on the front and back to finish the praised angular look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This seems wasteful, but since this is a premium product, Sony has spared no effort and expense, while recycling is built into the cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 measures 144 x 74 x 8.5 mm, which is a little bigger than the Xperia Z in all dimensions, but Sony has blessed the Z1 with a large 1/2.3" sensor and a 3,000mAh battery - the two smartphone features that drive the thickness up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, a Nokia Lumia 1020 is 10.4mm thick not counting the camera hump (its sensor is twice as big though) and it only has a 2,000mAh battery. The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has a 1/2.3" sensor and is pretty chunky (by smartphone standards), though that's because of the optical zoom. We'll talk about Sony's answer, the QX detachable camera modules, later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Nokia and Samsung sacrificed the design and pocketability for the sake of the camera, Sony went the other way and put the best camera that would fit in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Sony Xperia Z1 is bigger than the original Xperia Z, which wasn't one of the most compact 5" phones to begin with. That's the one potential deal-breaker with the Z1 - even if you like 5" screens (and some don't), there are smaller phones with bigger screens (like the 5.2" LG G2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, Sony has smoothed out the edges and the Z1 feels right in the hand (unless you're in the 5" phone detractors' camp). Having grown used to large handsets, we thought the Xperia Z1 was a pleasure to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 is IP58-certified, which means it will survive dives of up to 1.5m under water for 30 minutes (at least, it can actually last longer). Few phones outside Sony's lineup offer that, especially ones with uncompromised flagship specs (the Galaxy S4 Active is one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water resistance makes it necessary to protect the more complicated ports and slots with plastic flaps with rubber lining. However, the simple 3.5mm audio jack and the two charging pogo pins are left out in the open (flaps make plugging and unplugging a headset or a charging cable a hassle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the pogo pins are two flaps - one guards the MHL-enabled microUSB port and the other is for the microSD card slot (the Z1 comes with 16GB of built-in storage). Sony deserves a pat on the back for this as some other makers skip the microSD card slot even when they don't have to worry about keeping water out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the other side of the phone that holds all the physical controls, starting with Sony's favorite aluminum power button, the volume rocker and the dedicated shutter key. All the buttons are great and give a satisfying click when pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the flap that holds the microSIM card, which goes in on a small tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is at the bottom of the phone, so it doesn't get muffled when the handset is placed on a table. The lanyard eyelet is in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Xperia Z1 holds the impressive camera with G Lens and a single-LED flash. We guess the camera will have to rely on its larger-than-usual sensor for low-light photography (realistically, a xenon flash wouldn't fit in a device this thin). You'll also notice the small NFC logo here, which marks the position of the NFC transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, Sony says the Z1 gets better reception than the original Xperia Z thanks to improved antenna tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will launch in the three standard colors for the Xperia line - Black, White and Purple. The back and parts of the sides of the phone are painted, while the front is black for all color versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned that the aluminum frame undergoes anodisation. It's a new two-stage process that allows for better control over the color of the exposed aluminum on the edges and also offers better protection for the metal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 features a 5" Triluminos display of 1080p resolution (441ppi pixel density). The screen image is enhanced by Sony's proprietary X-Reality Engine and is built on the OptiContrast design (it eliminates the air gap between the glass and the screen, which reduces glare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is tack sharp and has great colors too. A weak point for Sony displays used to be poor viewing angles but starting with the Xperia Z Ultra and now the Xperia Z1 Sony has resolved the issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is still on the glossy side, which hurts its sunlight legibility. We'll have to take it to our lab to get accurate measurements though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony leveraged its camera know-how to custom-build an Exmor RS sensor just for the Xperia Z1. It's the highest resolution sensor in a smartphone at 20.7MP (even if you squint and include the Samsung Galaxy NX camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z1 uses a wide-angle (27mm) Sony G Lens camera with a bright F/2.0 aperture and a BIONZ image processor. The camera can shoot HDR stills and videos and the company is promising a best in class low-light performance. That's just the hardware though, the Xperia Z1 is very impressive on the software end too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a ton of new features, including manual controls (to battle the Lumia 1020) and various social features like the ability to live-stream video to Facebook. The camera app can pick the correct scene automatically with Superior Auto, do Timeshift burst, regular picture effects and impressive AR effects that paint a virtual world over your scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a Goggle-esque twist, the Xperia Z1 has a feature called Info-Eye that can recognize text, business cards, QR and barcodes, landmarks, bottles of wine and books too. Sony has partnered with leading companies in the respective fields to provide info (e.g. Amazon for books, Vino for wines, etc.). We have that on video, check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the camera app doesn't feel gimmicky (AR features usually raise a flag in cameras) and has something for everyone - casual users will enjoy the automatic effects and video streaming, while pros can try their hand at the manual settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony was kind enough to let us snap a camera sample. We won't judge image quality based on just one sample, especially on a phone that hasn't hit the stores yet, plus this isn't a full resolution sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras on the Xperia Z1 records 1080p video (the 4K video rumors didn't pan out). Still, with such a large sensor we expect the video quality to be great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update Sept 6: We've taken some more samples with the Xperia Z1. This time around, the quality has definitely improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a couple of new 1080p videos shot with the Xperia Z1 as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Cyber-shot QX100 and QX10 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's recent financial statement saw the point-and-shoot business in decline, while high-end cameras were on the rise. People passionate about photography are going for the high-end cameras that are getting more accessible and more capable, while everyone else just uses their smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is jumping ahead of the curve by introducing a brand new type of device - the Cyber-shot QX line of lens-style cameras. They consist of a lens, image sensor, image processor, battery and wireless connectivity unit and rely on a smartphone to act as primary controls, viewfinder and advanced features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By removing components Sony will be able to offer the key elements of a camera (lens and sensor) cheaper than if the company had to build an entire camera around them. This way you don't have to buy a new smartphone or even pay the full price of a camera but you can still get a good sensor and 10x optical zoom with QX10 or grab the acclaimed Sony RX100M II at a sizeable discount.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each camera has a clamp that allows it to attach to a smartphone though that's not strictly necessary, the communication is done wirelessly. The clamp can hold the Xperia Z1, which is fairly wide and we don't think most smartphones will be a problem for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is offering another way to attach the QX cameras, this one aimed specifically at the Xperia Z and Xperia Z1. It's a back cover with a circular hole in it where the camera goes. It's a cleaner solution that using the clamp and it offers some extra protection for your phone when the camera is removed (because if it's still attached, you'll want to be careful with it as such optics are not very resilient).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is used to pair the camera and the phone quickly, then Wi-Fi takes over and streams a live feed from the camera to the smartphone. The cameras have hardware On/Off buttons on them along with the basic controls - a zoom lever and a shutter key - though you can control those features via the phone's interface (and most of Sony's phones have a dedicated shutter key). There's also a standard tripod mount at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Cyber-shot QX100 lens-style camera consists of ZEISS Vario-Sonar T* lens with a fast F/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization and 3.6x zoom, 1" 20.2MP Exmor R sensor and a BIONZ image processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cyber-shot QX100 is the bigger of the two devices and if you didn't know better, you'll mistake it for a DSLR lens. It's cylindrical in shape and while it's in no way pocketable, it's still smaller than the Sony RX100M II. It's lighter too, so your phone with the QX100 on is easier to carry than a phone and a RX100M II camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QX10 is based on the Sony WX150 - Sony G Lens with F/2.0 aperture, optical image stabilization and 10x zoom, 1/2.3" 18.2MP Exmor R sensor and BIONZ image processor. It's similar to the Sony Xperia Z1's camera in terms of specs (aside from the optical zoom and OIS, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QX10 is actually compact, despite having a longer zoom. It looks like a pancake lens and while it's probably still a bit too big to pop into your pocket, it's easy to carry around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is another problem that Sony is solving with the Cyber-shot QX line - something like the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has a 1/2.3" sensor and 10x zoom too, but it's too bulky for an everyday phone and most people won't buy a "vacation phone", but with a QX detachable camera, you can easily switch between portability and high-end imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras can record 1440 x 1080p video at 30 frames per second (that's 1080p video cropped to 4:3 aspect ratio). We have to say that's disappointing as even mid-range phones can shoot 1080p video and 4:3 video is not all that useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One potentially big issue with getting a QX camera instead of a traditional camera is that the lens-style cameras lack their own flash and rely on the phone for that. And Sony doesn't have a xenon flash on any of its phones and single-LED just won't cut it in some situations even with a large 1" sensor and optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another potential issue is that you have two separate batteries and both of them are feeding a wireless connection. That's an extra power draw and if one of the batteries runs out, the setup no longer works. That also means there are two batteries to charge (though that's true about having a separate camera as well).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tripod and Smart imaging stand<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony also brought out two mounts for you smartphone - a tripod and the Smart imaging stand. Both of them clamp the phone so you don't need the tripod mount of the QX lens-style cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart imaging stand features NFC and promises to help the Xperia Z1 recognize smiles and you to capture photos without having to hold the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SmartWatch 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony brought back the SmartWatch 2 that was announced alongside the Xperia Z Ultra. It made sense then (the Z Ultra is a little too big to pull out of your pocket to check every SMS and tweet) and it makes even more sense now in light of the lens-style cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch is almost like a detachable screen - you can check incoming messages, accept, reject or mute incoming calls, control the music player, use it as a remote viewfinder, see upcoming calendar events, check your RSS feeds or the weather. That's just the list of default apps, third party developers can extend the functionality further and put apps on the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SmartWatch 2 is just at home in the Xperia lineup, it's based on the OmniBalance design which calls for an angular look with prominent metal and glass elements and the round power button (which was originally meant to resemble the crown on a luxury watch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the hand it feels almost like a regular watch - it's not round like the majority of watches, but you'll quickly get used to it. It has an IP57 rating, so it will survive daily encounters with the elements (rain, washing your hands) but you shouldn't put it under water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch weighs 122.5g - it sounds like a lot, it's as much as smartphones weigh, but to be fair a light metal watch will feel cheap. And like a regular watch you can attach any standard 24mm wristband - there's one in the box and Sony offers a several bold colors, but you can put on a classy metal or leather band too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a smartwatch, so you get capacitive touchscreen plus Back, Home and Menu keys. The screen is 1.6" big and has 220x176 pixels resolution (176ppi). It's a transflective LCD, meaning it has better sunlight legibility than LCD's on smartphones. The watch faces are customizable so you can change them daily to match your mood and outfit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SmartWatch 2 uses NFC and Bluetooth 3.0 to pair and communicate with any Android 4.0+ smartphone. Even though it's not using the low-power Bluetooth 4.0, Sony is still promising 3-4 days of normal usage with the watch always on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch can function even without a smartphone - you lose the "smart" functions, but you still get alarm, timer, stopwatch and even a compass.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has an impressive track record of innovation - many of their products are still recognizable brand names even if they are no longer relevant (remember the Walkman tape-players?). Some of that old spirit was very much felt watching the company unveil its new products at IFA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 (commonly known as Honami) feels like the old Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot soul has finally found a new physical form - a large Sony-made sensor and fast Sony-branded lens see the company flexing its vertical integration muscle and building on years of digital photography experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the Nokia Lumia 1020 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom, but the reality is that those two will probably be low-volume devices. The Xperia Z sold well, selling 4.6 million in 40 days according to some numbers, and the Z1 compares more favorably against the competition than its predecessor did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year the Xperia Z beat the competition to the quad-core Snapdragon punch, but when the other eventually arrived they brought a newer version of Qualcomm's chipset. The screen and camera were not great either if we have to be honest, but everyone definitely appreciated the design and the water resistant housing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year, Sony made sure to use the latest Snapdragon, fixed the screen, bolstered the waterproofing while keeping the sexy design and went all out with the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if the camera on your current smartphone isn't that good, maybe it doesn't matter anymore - the Cyber-shot QX lens-style cameras are a cheaper camera upgrade than either buying a new phone or a new camera. The writing has been on the wall for point-and-shoot cameras for a couple of years now and the QX10 might be the final nail in the coffin, while the QX100 brings back all the people who begrudgingly use the small sensors in their smartphones because their camera can't auto-upload photos and share them on Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The detached theme continued with the SmartWatch 2, which is an easy and discrete way to read information off the phone and handle basic commands. It's especially good if you have a large Xperia Z Ultra or a Xperia Z1 with QX100 attached stashed in your backpack and the phone beeps with a new notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we'd have to spend more time with the Sony Xperia Z1 and its sidekicks to test the new chipset, bigger battery, better screen, but the good thing about it is it doesn't hinge on the camera like the Lumia 1020 or the HTC One.</paragraph>
