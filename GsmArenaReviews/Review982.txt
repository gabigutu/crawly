			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just taking the photo won't do these days - you'll want to edit and share it, then rake in the likes. Except most cameras pretty much bail out at the snapshot. Not the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom though, a hybrid of a point-and-shoot with 10x optical zoom and a Galaxy S4 mini. This is Samsung's second such attempt after the Galaxy Camera, which was based on the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has full telephony features (unlike the Camera), but it's not the most comfortable phone around. Photography is the full-time job here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 10x zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) sits in front of a 16MP sensor. At the wide end, the lens is the very wide 24mm in 35mm equivalent, the aperture goes from f/3.1 to f/6.3 and there's a mechanical shutter. The Galaxy S4 zoom has a control ring around the lens like some high-end point-and-shoots do, a xenon flash and LED light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the camera specs, the rest is a full-featured Galaxy S4 mini hardware, including the IR blaster, which can control a projector (the one, most likely, you'd use to show off your photos).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are some differences between the Galaxy S4 zoom and the mini but, outside the size, those are insignificant. The chipset is powerful enough to shoot 1080p video at 30fps and 720p at 60fps (same as the Galaxy Camera). Samsung has made sure too that the default camera app is the most advanced we've seen yet, and there are a number of helpful image and video editors among other tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 4.2 you'd be able to install other editors and camera apps too (though these will have to add support for the optical zoom feature). Not to mention all the social networking and other tools for sharing your photos, which can be piped through blazing fast LTE or Wi-Fi, DLNA, MHL or Group Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jump over to the next page for a closer look at the hardware, while we try to avoid any "zooming in" puns.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom measures 125.5 x 63.5 x 15.4mm, the same height and width as the S4 mini, but thicker. Obviously. The actual number doesn't tell the whole story as the device itself isn't all that thick, save for two key areas - the lens and the grip. The first is out of necessity (you can make a 10x lens only so thin) and the other's for the sake of ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom has two faces - that of an S4 mini on the front and a Samsung camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the S4 zoom is fundamentally the same as the Galaxy Camera's, tough Samsung has moved some things around. If you ignore the back for a second, the device is almost identical to the mini, except the volume rocker is now on the right side. This allows you to use the Zoom in the same way you would the S4 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For snapping photos, the grip offers a good hold of the device and you can shoot one handed without worrying you'll drop it. Samsung's favorite hyperglazed plastic is rather slippery which isn't ideal but isn't a deal breaker either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrangement of the controls is fairly comfortable, whether you use the Galaxy S4 zoom as a phone or as a camera. Not in equal amounts though - holding it horizontally by the grip is a lot better than holding it vertically with the camera lens pressing against your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed something odd - there's a piece of glass (or clear plastic) on the front of the lens, over the mechanical lens cover. That means you can't rely on the cover for protection from smudges and the glass can get scratched too. We hope this is some sort of reinforced glass that will be durable enough to survive in the long run though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to further emphasize the camera-centric nature of the device, there's a tripod mounting hole at the bottom. There's a small stopper plugging it when not in use, but since it's not attached to the camera you should be careful not to lose it. This can be used in situations when you need a steady shot (e.g. time lapse videos). The Optical Image Stabilization is usually good enough for a handheld night shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom is quite thick and heavy compared to a modern smartphone, but still pocketable, unless you're wearing tight jeans. You might want to consider using the lanyard eyelet instead and carry the device like a regular camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom packs a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen picked up from the S4 mini parts bin. It has qHD resolution (540 x 960) and 256ppi. That's not enough to challenge higher-end devices like the Galaxy S4 or the Galaxy Camera, but reasonable in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Super AMOLED renders highly saturated colors (if you're a fan of that) and has great colors and viewing angles. It isn't particularly bright though and not as reflection-free as some other Samsung AMOLED screens so sunlight legibility suffers. There are cases when the S4 zoom display is hard to see in direct sunlight, which is a problem for a camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display doesn't use a PenTile matrix, instead it uses the arrangement that debuted with the Galaxy Note II with three subpixels for each pixel, but the Blue one has a different shape. Anyway, the sharpness isn't on the level of 400+ ppi flagships and you can notice occasional jaggies and color halos around fine, high-contrast detail like text, but you won't see it in photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While 4.3" of diagonal and qHD resolution are in the midrange as far as smartphones are concerned, the display is actually pretty high-end for a point-and-shoot camera. Most cameras you'll find have 3-or-so inch screens (even the touchscreen models) and far lower resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls, ports and slots<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Galaxy S4 zoom is a direct copy of the S4 mini - there are the front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors around the earpiece and the hardware Home and capacitive Back and Menu keys below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we liked (even if it took a little getting used to) is that the camera app disables the capacitive buttons. Those are too easy to press accidentally when you hold the zoom in one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone (top if you look at it as a camera) holds the Power/Lock key, volume rocker and the shutter key. The Power/Lock key and volume rocker are fairly thin and not the most comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware shutter key is another matter though, it's fairly comfortable even though it would have been slightly better to use if it was slightly further to the left. It can be half-pressed to focus and will launch the camera app if you hold it (but it doesn't automatically unlock the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Galaxy Camera there was a zoom lever around the shutter key, but is missing here. Instead, you can use the control ring around the lens to zoom in and out (or use the volume rocker as on a regular phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ring has a ridged exterior for extra grip, but rotates smoothly (there are no distinct steps). At the moment, the ring only controls the zoom, but we hope Samsung adds an option to control things like aperture, shutter speed and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the ring has an advantage over the zoom lever, it's much easier to get a specific zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the lens is the xenon flash and LED light. The flash is always available, you don't have to manually extend and retract it like on the Galaxy Camera. On the other side of the lens is the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom (left in camera orientation) holds the 3.5mm audio jack, secondary microphone and the IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom (right) is the primary mic and the MHL-enabled microUSB port. The USB port is actually at the edge of a plastic flap that covers the battery and microSIM card slot. The battery compartment was borrowed from digital cameras and features a lock that holds the battery in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery has 2,330mAh capacity, a bit more than the Galaxy S4 mini got and not bad for a point-and shoot camera. Keep in mind that most such cameras don't have active radios, which can drain the battery pretty quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM card slot can easily be accessed without having to remove the battery, which is great if you need to swap out the card (the Galaxy S4 zoom will probably not be your primary device and you won't keep a SIM in it at all times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port handles charging, data connectivity and TV Out duties and can be used with the flap open or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the left side of the phone (bottom for the camera) offers a microSD card slot, tripod mounting hole and the lanyard eyelet. The microSD card slot is covered by a plastic flap and the card is easily hot-swappable. You'll probably need a card in there as the S4 zoom comes with only 4GB of built-in storage and there's less than 3GB available to the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom, we also received a case for the device. It consists of a rubbery strip that encircles the phone and has buttons for all the controls. It keeps the microUSB port exposed, so you can charge the zoom and download photos without having to remove the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The case probably won't protect the device against drops, but at least the screen will be safer under the flap. The flap has a groove about a third of the way from the side so you can flip it slightly open to take a peak and close it. It's an active cover too, so the screen wakes automatically when you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a hole for the earpiece so you can talk with the flap closed, but there's no window that shows a part of the screen with the time and notifications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has the same software version as the original Galaxy S4 and the S4 mini. Android 4.2.2 Jelly bean is skinned with TouchWiz Nature UX and most of the special treats of the Galaxy S4 are available here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video tour of the S4 zoom interface with focus on its key feature, the camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom features the new lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message, beautiful images pulled from TripAdvisor providing the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though you can switch back to the old one or disable it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in unskinned Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and will light up the screen to show the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the notification area are identical to what you get in the original Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles at the top of the notification area to quickly enable and disable features. There are more than you can see, of course - the rest are a swipe away. Or you can tap the new button that displays a grid of all the shortcuts. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can hide this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. Widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a discreet but useful change to the way you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen - there's a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, which can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom comes with the Multi-window feature as well. It runs two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the division line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom features a 1/2.3" 16MP image sensor and an optically stabilized 10x zoom lens. It's more or less what you can expect from a mid-range point-and-shoot, but fairly impressive for a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the latest generation of what debuted on the Galaxy Camera and was later adapted by the Galaxy S4. It offers tons of features, for both casual and advanced users, and moves carefully between them so it doesn't confuse newcomers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera starts in automatic mode by default, but you can make it start in the last used mode instead. The right column of the screen displays the battery charge, the virtual still and video camera shutters and the mode selection button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the top left is the back/front-facing camera toggle plus some essential indicators like flash mode and the remaining shots counter. The right arrow brings out additional settings, the selection can be customized. At the bottom you get the gallery shortcut with a thumbnail of the last photo taken, plus an up arrow that brings out a selection of color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mode selection button is the gateway to most of the functionality of the S4 zoom camera - single taps will switch between Auto, Smart, Expert and My mode, while a press and hold brings out the settings for the current mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart mode is like the one you get on the Galaxy S4, but with twice as many options. There's burst shot, Best face, HDR, Macro, Panorama, Eraser (lets you remove moving objects), Sound &amp; shot (records ambient sound with the photo, but is hard to share), Drama shot (creates a composite of multiple photos), Animated photo (creates an animated GIF) and so on and so forth. There are also specific modes like Baby and Food.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These modes can be selected from a grid or from a carousel. The grid is quicker, but the carousel offers descriptive text, which is a good way to learn what each mode does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart suggest is a new addition to the interface. It automatically picks the three options it thinks are most appropriate for the current scene and leaves the final choice to you. For example, if it's dark it will suggest Night mode or Fireworks, if it sees you're focusing from a close distance it will offer Macro, for landscape shots it will suggest Landscape and Panorama and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of panoramas, the S4 zoom did a pretty good job of the stitching with only minor artifacts, but we were very disappointed by the resolution, which is under 500px vertically. The Galaxy S4 ,in comparison, can churn out impressive 60MP panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expert mode is aimed at more experienced photographers that can set the appropriate aperture, shutter speed and ISO for the shot on their own. The interface presents these options as lens control rings on the display, but you can't use the actual lens ring for any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tweak a lot more - sharpness, EV, metering, drive (for automatic exposure bracketing) and so on. You can choose between Manual, Program and Custom modes on Expert depending on how much control you want over the settings. And don't get intimidated by all this camera lingo, the Info button is always available to give you a brief description of what each feature does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's My Mode, which lets you star up to five options from both Smart and Expert modes, so you don't have to dig through the long menus, and save time for frequently used modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu of the camera reveals yet more functionality. One particularly interesting option is Remote Viewfinder - you install the app on a smartphone and the Galaxy S4 zoom will beam the viewfinder image and camera controls over Wi-Fi (the S4 zoom turns into a Wi-Fi hotspot for the pairing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other sharing options include Samsung's proprietary Share shot, Buddy photo share and ChatON photo share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are options for the AF/shutter sound volume, rule-of-thirds gridlines, viewfinder brightness (independent from the global screen setting), AF light (turns on the LED light to focus in the dark) and GPS tag and Contextual file name (it uses the GPS to detect where you are, the file name will include the name of the city and the street you are on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is turned on in Auto mode, in fact there's no option to disable it. If you go to one of the more advanced modes an option will appear in the settings menu, but we recommend keeping it on as it removes hand shake. OIS works for both the still and video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens ring is useful even outside the camera - if you rotate it, the S4 zoom displays a quick launcher that gets you directly into one of several pre-selected modes - Auto, Beauty face, Landscape, Macro, Animated photo and Night, or you can launch the gallery. You just rotate the lens ring to the desired mode and wait a second. If you take several seconds to pick the camera won't launch automatically, you have to tap the shutter key once you finally make a decision.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll leave image quality discussions for the review, but you can gorge your eyes on the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few snaps that use the HDR mode (called Rich tone in the UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom lives up to its name thanks to the 10x optical zoom. Here's a quick sample of how close you can get with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the above images show off the resolving power of the Galaxy S4 zoom at 10x zoom, it doesn?t give you a good feel of just how close that 10x zoom can get you. Here are some more samples ? the first photo shows the scene with no zoom, the second one is from the S4 zoom at 10x and the third shows the maximum close up you can get with the Nokia 808 PureView.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've highlighted an area in the 808 PureView photo that shows where the max zoom image of the S4 zoom fits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not even close - the Galaxy S4 zoom manages to capture much more detail on the air conditioners, the metal railing, flower pots and so on thanks to its 10x zoom. The 808 PureView has only its high resolution sensor to rely on and that doesn't cut it if you need a close-up shot of something far away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a quick sample in the dark to see how the xenon on the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom does. We pit it against the Galaxy S4 (which relies on LED only) and the Nokia 808 PureView (which packs xenon too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S4 zoom flash fills the scene more uniformly than the 808 PureView flash. The Galaxy S4 photo looks pretty good too, but it was taken at a slow shutter speed, which is only good for static scenes. The xenon flash will let you take photos of moving people.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom can record 1080p videos at the standard 30fps or you can go to 60fps at 720p, which offers fluid motion for action-packed scenes. This mode is quite rare on phones, but can really make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can also do 120fps slow-mo videos (but resolution drops to 576p) and there's a time-lapse option at up to 1/8x speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use touch focus and zoom during video recording and snap stills too. Here's a video that goes from 1x zoom to 10x and back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera shares the still camera interface, but there are a few options specific to the camcorder. One is to enable Quiet zoom during video recording, so you can zoom without noise from the mechanism being captured in the recording, and Windcut, which tries to reduce noise in windy situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a 1080p sample recoded with the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sphere, gallery, image and video editors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One feature missing from the camera app is spherical panoramas, this is handled by a separate app instead. It's called Sphere (emphasis on the app's location-awareness) and it's a mini social network that lets you share spherical panoramas and browse ones shot by other people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapping a sphere is fairly easy - the app may request that you put the device on a table for a few seconds the first time you're using it (so it can calibrate the sensors), after that you hold it about 15cm / 6" from your chest and turn around to capture the entire sphere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app shows the best spheres on its default screen, but you can also browse by category or location. People can follow your posts and you can follow theirs, with new spheres showing up in the My Feed tab. Of course, you can choose not to make a sphere public or at least strip the location info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the S4 zoom is the standard TouchWiz Gallery, which is very capable. It has several view modes - Albums (the basic one), but also Time, Locations, People and Favorites, which help you sort through your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the thumbnails can be adjusted with a pinch zoom or with the lens ring. The lens ring can also be used to zoom in on photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe right to reveal a pane with all the folders, which helps navigate multiple folders with photos (you can pick multiple photos from multiple folders at once). One option advanced photographers will appreciate is the picture details popup, which shows things like focal length, ISO, aperture, shutter speed and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gallery will automatically pull photos from your Picasa account (now folded into Google+).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also offers two ways to annotate your photos. One turns the photo into a virtual Polaroid and lets you write a note on the empty space. The other is non-destructive and saves the scribbled label away from the photo, but those are harder to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Story Album can be really helpful in organizing your photos. After a shooting session it will prompt you to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom also includes Photo Suggest, which gives you a peek at the most popular locations and sights people have photographed either near you or in places you plan on visiting. This way you can plan ahead what to see and photograph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app offers a fairly capable image editor. It covers the basic operations like crop and rotate, adjust image properties (from Auto adjust to manual exposure tweaking), add color effects and frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more creative app is the Paper Artist - it applies an effect to the photo and lets you paint only a section of the image to highlight a specific objects. You can also draw freehand and add frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing videos is also enabled and it's a very simple process. You pick a theme (you get only one preinstalled, the rest you can download for free), which puts in a few stock clips for titles and lets you plug in your own videos and photos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our first reaction to the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom was "It's smaller!" You probably want to hear about the optics or the image sensor, but the simple fact is that the Galaxy Camera was the size of a micro four thirds, which people that are even remotely serious about photography would prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Camera GC100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom on the other hand is closer to a point-and-shoot in size, with similar camera specs and unmatched flexibility even by "smart camera" standards. You could bring it anywhere and it can be the only device you carry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a camera, sure, but it's also a fully featured smartphone and Android 4.2 offers any functionality you can dream of, from messaging through social networking to unrelated things like gaming or navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's this versatility that makes the S4 zoom special. Where a new generation camera will bring features missing in the camera you bought last year, with the zoom you just need to grab an app from the Play Store. This makes sure it won't go obsolete quickly, actually it will be ahead of regular cameras for at least a few years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such heavy focus on photography, telephony took a step back in terms of ergonomics. It's not impossible to replace your handset with the zoom, but it's just not as convenient as a regular smartphone for everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom is as good a smartphone as the Galaxy S4 mini, which is shaping up to be a solid midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all comes down to pricing - the S4 zoom needs to be priced around the S4 mini to stand a chance of being successful. Midrange droids are cheap and point-and-shoot cameras cheaper still. You can even throw in an Eye-Fi Mobi to glue the two together and still come in under budget (money wise that is, the Wi-Fi connection will eat into the battery life budget and is not always the best solution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom will never topple smartphones or point-and-shoot cameras, but with an agreeable price tag it can be the perfect travel companion.</paragraph>
