			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s not like good old-fashioned phones with buttons are going extinct ? they are still the money makers. But for handsets such as the Sony Ericsson Elm sneaking into the spotlight is harder than ever ? Androids, Symbians, iPhones, smart and not so smart touchscreens are all over the place. Well, one thing?s for sure ? a break is welcome once in a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cybershot and Walkman are out of the Sony Ericsson mix, and the doubters are perhaps busy telling you GreenHeart will never be able to rise to the same heights. It?s a completely different market and matching iconic, game-changing phones like the K750 and the W800 is out of the question really. But we?re not here to look back at what used to be. It?s a market were rules are set by touch-screen phones and handsets like the Sony Ericsson Elm do deserve credit for trying to find their own spot under the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm and its slider sibling Hazel are flying the green flag to lead the company?s evolving feature phone lineup. We caught a glimpse of both already but let?s now invite Sony Ericsson Elm over again and take a closer look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm is taking over from recent Sony Ericsson feature phones that knew they needed all the high-tech specs to stay competitive. The Sony Ericsson Elm doesn?t compromise performance to stay within budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has all the premium features you may get these days ? 3G connectivity with light-speed data, Wi-Fi with DLNA support, GPS receiver and microSD memory expansion. Just like its GreenHeart forerunner ? the C901 ? the Elm is easily one of the top 5-megapixel cameraphones out there. The upgrade to VGA video @ 30 fps shows even more hidden power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the full spec sheet with all deal breakers we?ve managed to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcomings are too specific and most of the intended users won?t miss anything badly. The advanced social networking integration will perhaps make up for some of those. The solid battery life, splash-resistant and ergonomically curved body do add to Elm?s appeal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Elm is powerful enough, and its price is very reasonable. We guess that?s enough to get your full attention. You?re welcome to read on as we explore the Elm inside and out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One of the smallest retail packages ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Elm wants you to make no mistake about the phone?s eco-friendly stand. It?s really small and made of recycled paper. This tiny package contains the energy-efficient charger and a rather basic pair of headphones. The Elm uses a FastPort for connectivity, and that?s unfortunate to begin with. To make things worse, there?s no data cable supplied.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Elm 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is a compact candybar measuring 110 x 45 x 14 mm. Candybar is not to be taken literally though. The Elm is slightly curved at the rear to give it that unmistakable silhouette, and a very comfortable and secure hand hold. The handset is small enough to fit in any pocket or purse, and the mere 90 grams of weight make it remarkably friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lightweight it is, but the Elm feels quite nice to hold thanks to its quality materials. Plus, most of the weight is concentrated at the bottom for a secure grip and comfortable typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elm is part of the Sony Ericsson GreenHeart lineup, which is all about recycled plastics, reduction of hazardous substances and eco-friendly packaging. The concept is clear enough but - more importantly - the green-conscious Elm doesn't compromise on looks ? or features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone blends fingerprint-proof matt plastic and aluminum in an asymmetric pattern, which goes well with the unusual curved shape. The Sony Ericsson Elm will be available in two colors: Metal Black and Pearly Rose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The irregular shape (called human curvature) might be a self-conscious accent but it works more than well. The weight balance is perfect: the numpad sticks to your thumb and the risk of the phone tipping over backwards is near zero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm has the extra girth right where it matters too - around the shutter key. So, all in all, the unusual shape works quite in its favor - the Elm looks unusual enough to get noticed but ergonomics are well thought out too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm uses a 2.2" 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution. What we miss here is the superb clarity and contrast of the C901 Cyber-Shot. The Elm's screen however is close and sunlight legibility and contrast aren't disappointing. They just don't seem enough to match the C901 quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the regular Sony Ericsson navigation deck - designers have only experimented with the buttons' shape and layout. With the Elm we're possibly looking at one of the most tactile and comfortable designs. The solid press is very welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is near perfect: very solid to press in all four directions and a large and distinct confirm button. The metallic frame of the D-pad nicely matches the handset's aluminum rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is made of the same rubber-like plastic used for the controls and the D-pad. The numpad buttons are big enough and nicely convex for great touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Key presses involve a distinct click and typing is quick and easy. The soft white keypad backlighting is strong and even. The numpad is slightly arched inward to make it extra easy on the thumb and the great weight distribution of the body is another boost to comfortable handling and typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson Elm features nothing but the regular Fast Port - unfortunately. Traditionally, this proprietary connectivity port doesn't have any protective cover to conceal the connectors and keep dust away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset hosts the nicely shaped volume rocker - which doubles as a zoom lever when taking or browsing pictures. The shutter key is further down - at the thickest part of the handset's body. The little round knob is very responsive with distinct half and full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera lens, the LED flash and the loudspeaker. The battery cover is made of aluminum and has the Sony Ericsson logo. There is no protection on the camera lens, except a slight bulge around it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover (using the tiny cleft on top) unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-43 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer claims the battery should provide up to 430 hours of standby and up to 9.5 hours of talk time in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over three to six days on a single charge, depending mainly on multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also under the battery cover is the microSD memory card slot. It is hot-swappable, you just have to remove the back cover to access it. There is no eject mechanism so you'd better have some strong nails to pull the card out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is a compact candybar and the unusual curved shape works well in its favor. The handset certainly knows to make a good first impression but we're sure users will appreciate the ergonomics too. The controls are very comfortable and the numpad is near perfect. Curved inwards, with wide convex keys and soft rubbery finish, it certainly makes typing a pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact and lightweight Elm doesn?t have an expensive feel or exceptionally stylish finish. The materials are of high quality though ? it?s a reliable and well built phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The regular user interface packs widgets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elm uses the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that's used in most of their midrange handsets. The Flash UI is well familiar and deservedly praised for its looks, speed and multitasking ability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar featuring tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth but you can't do that when sending a file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one important upgrade on top of all that - the homescreen widgets. Sony Ericsson tried this concept on the C901, where the Facebook app had a handy homescreen shortcut with live updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are now a total of five homescreen widgets: Calendar, Walk Mate, Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. Each of them takes almost the whole standby screen, so you can only have one visible at a time. But they can all be working at once and easily switched between using the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get to select which widgets will be active and you may choose to enable all of them. Pressing the Up key on the D-pad, lets you manage the widgets and set their behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar widget is a shortened version of the actual app, showing the upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walk Mate should be familiar to Sony Ericsson users ? a simple step step-counter, which works in the background. It has a green twist this time around and is aptly called Walk Mate Eco ? it converts your walking exercise into saved CO2 emissions.Which of course only makes sense if you?re walking outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three social widgets are convenient shortcuts to the actual Facebook, Twitter and MySpace apps, with on-screen live updates. They show your friends? profile pictures and their latest activities ? just like the Facebook app on the C901.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way, you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your entire contact list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known for anyone that has used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search the contacts list by gradual typing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson Elm. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is among the first phones by the company to use their NoiseShield technology, which is active noise cancellation. The option for toggling that on and off is only available during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality it does a nice job. If you are in a high-traffic street turning the shield on will reduce the ambient sounds up to 60-70%, without muffling your voice. Nicely done!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm offers video-call functionality, but since there is no front-facing camera, it's more like video sharing - meaning that you can see the other party on your display but you can only share what your primary camera "is seeing".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It uses four tabs for All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional speakerphone test with the Sony Ericsson Elm. However, the maximum volume was a bit disappointing and the device scored average. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of the latest Sony Ericsson phones, the Elm sports the threaded message view. SMS to and from a certain contact is organized in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the conversation-style layout and the regular Inbox is only a matter of toggling a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact is that if you get a reply while you're still in the thread, it will be automatically added to the conversation just like a chat, instead of appearing as an alert on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson Elm offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts and the option to assign categories to messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Categories also allow quick and comfortable sorting of messages with separate folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course predictive typing. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when composing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically retrieved the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the file type is incompatible with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson Elm (much like all other Sony Ericsson feature phones) can't preview any documents including the ones attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of any document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The Media Center has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm runs the flash-based Media Center to bring together all the media content on your phone (Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds). The Media Center settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Player on the Elm is the latest Walkman version. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes. The Walkman player on the Elm also offers fun styles ? skins that change the look of the player into a vinyl record player, a reel-to-reel tape player, CD player and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no shake control however, despite the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A familiar Walkman goodie, SensMe, offers a different approach to populating a playlist. It automatically generates playlists based on what tempo and what mood you want ? fast or slow, sad or happy. Songs need to be tagged, which is only possible with the Sony Ericsson?s PC software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is also available ? it analyzes the song currently playing on the radio or whatever it picks up with its mic and retrieves the performer and the name of the song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Other extras include fullscreen mode and screenshot capability - you have the option to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no XviD or DivX support of course. Sony Ericsson are keen for you to use their MediaGo desktop software to transfer any video from a computer to the handset in the correct format and resolution to be played on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review of the desktop application proved it does its job alright, but there's still more to wish for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our Elm now, the Media center video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken, along with prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the highlighted photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section is a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Photo gallery can get quite laggy when there are a lot of photos in a folder. Sometimes, the phone froze for a couple of seconds before moving on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a richly-featured tool for managing your photo collection and it offers very good customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The sending options include Send as Picture Msg, as Email, via Bluetooth or even to web albums (Picasa, Blogger or Flickr).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. Pan and Zoom and a slideshow feature are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Elm is capable of embedding standard GPS coordinates in images. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but we are sure only a few users will make use of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson Elm has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics the player does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. It also offers the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Perfect audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Sony Ericsson Elm is basically as good as it gets. The handset performed excellently in each and every part of our traditional tests, recording some of the best results we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is perfect for the entire audible range, the greatest deviation being hard to detect even in lab conditions. The signal-to-noise ratio is also excellent and so are the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortions are also neatly kept under control and if it wasn't for it being slightly on the quiet side we would pronounce the Elm as the perfect portable audio player.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good 5 megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm has a 5 megapixel camera capable of producing images at a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped a LED flash, which also serves as auto-focus assist light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera offers a lot of extra features such as smile shutter, face detection, auto-rotate, macro mode, spot metering, image geotagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar at the bottom gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. The Elm doesn't have a manual ISO setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame when the image is captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Smile Shutter is easy ? to activate it you press the camera key all the way down and release it. A small blinking on-screen yellow icon indicates that the mode is on and the phone will automatically snap the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS geotagging is available too. Just remember it?s assisted lock so it involves a small amount of data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the Elm allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm camera is a really capable shooter. Image quality is very good, easily ranking among the top 5-megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasing colors and good contrast with the noise levels well under control. The amount of resolved detail is excellent, comparable to the best in the class ? Sony Ericsson C901 and the Nokia 6700 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson Elm. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Elm is also capable of shooting video, and it actually does quite well in that department. The Elm captures VGA videos at 30fps. The LED flash can be used in video mode too. The clips are stored in mp4 format and take about 7 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality and the resolved detail look good, but the compression sometimes is too high. Still the captured videos are mostly satisfying and that?s more than we expected from a Sony Ericsson feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Almost perfect connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is not an internet-centric device but scores excellent on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. 7.2 Mbps HSDPA, as well as 2.0 Mbps HSUPA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson Elm offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also A2DP support so you can listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last but not least, there is also the microSD card slot (under the battery cover), which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. Unfortunately, the Elm uses the old FastPort and there is no data cable bundled in the package, so you will need to buy one separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the USB disappointment, you can sync your device via some of the popular exchange services such as Google. We successfully configured our Google for exchange account and the Elm retrieved our predefined contacts, calendar events, Google mail along with the settings almost immediately. The two things that were left out during the sync process were the contact pictures and birthdays. We guess you must add them manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm sports premium features such as Wi-Fi and GPS with A-GPS support. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi range is rather disappointing compared to other phones we've tested. What?s more, to use a Wi-Fi connection you first need to configure a data account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the fact that the Wi-Fi connectivity has higher priority, the first thing Elm does in attempt to connect to Internet is to check if you have a data account. It may sound frustrating, but don?t worry ? you may type whatever you want for the name and the APN. It?s not necessary to be a proper and working data account, you just need to have something entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Sony Ericsson Elm allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over the EDGE or 3G connection (even though Wi-Fi is listed as an option, we just couldn't get it to work). So in essence - you might be able to stream video (such as YouTube) over Wi-Fi, but expect to have some issues with the setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the Media Home app uses the DLNA capabilities of the Elm to share its media with other DLNA-enabled devices such as phones, home players or TV via Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent browser, small screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser preinstalled on the Elm is the same as Yari's - an updated version of the popular NetFront 3.5 mobile browser. It offers a much smoother experience than before and renders web pages more quickly. Almost every time it nails the zoom level for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes to a different bright color each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a mouse pointer, the new NetFront 3.5 web browser always operates in fullscreen mode and the four most important features are easily accessible on a toolbar - mini-map, address field, favorites and downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can find some other features as well ? such as mark-and-copy, save image or find on page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an automatic RSS finder. If you browse an RSS enabled site, a small RSS icon will appear. If you click there you can access all the available RSS feeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has full Flash support, although all of the YouTube videos redirect to the mobile streaming app. Still if you open any other website with Flash videos you?ll be able to play them directly within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the Flash content runs trouble-free and all, but streaming videos (both actual Flash and those in the mobile YouTube app) can only use a 3G connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned before, watching streaming videos is possible only over EDGE or 3G connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Java Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator and Torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts you to add it to the calendar too. There is just one general-purpose type of entry in the Calendar, but it features enough details. Notes are composed similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms application hardly needs any detailing. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles, but you can run the Converter from there. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit on recording length, making the available free memory the only restriction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications are abundant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson Elm comes with AccuWeather, Calendar Wallpaper, Checkbook, EcoMate, GreenCalculator, Grocery List, NeoReader, Standby World 3D, Tracker and YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather application gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest. Current conditions overview and a three day forecast is available for a great number of cities around the world. You should bear in mind that the data is downloaded in real time so data charges apply. Not that we can think of any other way for the application to work but we still feel a warning is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar Wallpaper puts an analog clock on the wallpaper. Using the built in accelerometer, you can switch to other views ? calendar, tasks and last photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Checkbook allows you to create different accounts, enter a balance and start managing them (income and expenses). There is also a graphical chart for easy tracking your transactions in time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EcoMate is an educational app. You have a pet (panda in this case) and you must answer a few questions every day to support its virtual habitat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GreenCalclulator and Grocery List speak for themselves, while the NeoReader is a barcode scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Standby World 3D is a nice application with readings for up to three different time zones around the world. The background changes as day turns into night in the selected locations. You can set this app as a default background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last app is the Tracker. It requires GPS data and tracks your route as you exercise ? jogging, running or bicycling. You can view your previous routes as well as a summary, which includes things like Total, Average or Best lap time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Expensive GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is decent enough and with A-GPS enabled, it managed to acquire a lock almost instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm is equipped with Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect in a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather. SatNav software is a rare sight in a feature phone - installing one yourself is near impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead are downloaded over the air. A flat data fee is recommended but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation. Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well, like with Nokia Maps. It really would have helped in avoiding data roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass like on most of its competitors to facilitate navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot for Sony Ericsson comes with 30-days trial period, beginning the first time you start the app. After this month expires you will need a subscription ? 3 months in Europe will set you back 19.95 euro and for North America 3 months cost 19.95 US dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After Nokia released their Ovi Maps with full voice-guided navigation for free this seems just way too expensive. For almost 30 euro for 3 months we at least expected to get to download the maps, because paying the data charges (especially when roaming) really ramps up the price of the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A single game onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm has only one Java game preinstalled ? the Quadrapop. It?s a Tetris replica, this time with some colorful creatures instead of bricks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By this point it must be pretty clear that the Sony Ericsson Elm is a reasonably attractive package. Rich functionality comes in a well built shell and the potent user interface has done well to be in step with the times. Things get even sweeter if you happen to like the human-curvature design. And we need to say it straight ? it?s not a gimmick, ergonomics are excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you haven?t been caught in the touchscreen wave, the Sony Ericsson Elm is certainly worth a look when choosing your next phone. The social network integration and the top connectivity options don?t make it a smartphone but are certainly nice to have. Imaging is good enough to let the Elm take advantage of some of that Cybershot nostalgia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a better idea of the good value for money the Sony Ericsson Elm offers, we?ll take a look at several of its competitors that cost roughly the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic is possibly quite a threat. The slim metal-clad handset is a close match for imaging but fails in the connectivity department for the lack of WLAN. On the other hand if smart is your game, the Nokia N79 is a S60 3rd Symbian smartphone that can deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6700 classic ? Nokia N79</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course if you are happy with the Sony Ericsson Elm, but just wish for a bigger screen, the Sony Ericsson Hazel slider-twin is the way to go. It offers basically the same package but the slider form factor has made more room for the display. However, this will probably mean a slightly higher asking price too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally if you are still sitting on a fence regarding touchscreen, you might want to take a look at some of the low-end smartphones out there. The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and the HTC Tattoo are slightly more expensive and obviously lesser cameraphones too, but offer full-touch control and larger screens (not to mention the full-featured smartphone capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the Sony Ericsson Elm is among the solid offerings in this price range, fully capable of standing its ground against the competition. Plus, it carries the GreenHeart logo and the eco-friendly vibe to give you a nice warm feeling inside. GreenHeart has still a long way to go to reach Cybershot or Walkman, but the Elm is one step closer.</paragraph>
