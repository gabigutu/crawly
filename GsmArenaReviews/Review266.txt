			<paragraph>One of the first things we saw landing in Barcelona for the MWC last month was a huge Samsung U900 Soul billboard. The South Korea-based company has ever since been doing everything within their powers to keep the handset in the public eye. Now with the phone safely in our office, we have the perfect chance to see if it is worth the fuss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, our first impressions were downright positive. In the photo quality department this fashion fella challenges the current champ Nokia N95 8GB. Here is a small teaser - 100% crops from the two cameras. Which one you like better? Can you guess which one is by Samsung U900 Soul and which one is by Nokia N95 8GB?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The market rivals of Samsung U900 Soul are mostly within the Samsung family. Samsung G600 is kind of the economy package for the budget minded. The G800 is a monster of cameraphone packing optical zoom on top of the other camera goodies. That goes with massive size however and Samsung G800 isn't really as pocket-friendly as the Soul. Nokia 6500 slide also seems a nice alternative for its 3 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics and great metallic body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we shouldn't forget the Soul's forerunners. Samsung U600 and U700 have their own fans, although inevitably ageing. The recently reviewed LG KF600 could also steal some customers with an InteractPad that has greater capabilities than the touchpad on Soul. All in all, there is more than enough competition in the segment where the Samsung U900 is trying to succeed. And, the scene can get even more crowded, if you count some more 5 megapixel shooters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U900 Soul 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 12.9 mm thick, Samsung U900 Soul is obviously not the slimmest Ultra handset we've ever set eyes on. As it turns out, it's a tad thicker than any other member of the Ultra II lineup. However, in terms of design, we are willing to say that it is the best looking U-mobile we've ever got to test. Besides, it is meant to excel in features more than any other Ultra handset ever was. The 5 megapixel camera and the touch pad are still rare enough and can hardly be overlooked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of controls layout and ergonomics, Samsung U900 Soul resembles the well-known Samsung U600. Add or take the power button and the video-call camera, that is. The display has also been altered slightly and is now capable of showing up to 16M color, as opposed to the 262K of U600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the front panel of Samsung U900 Soul we see the earpiece dead center and the video-call camera on the left. The 2.2" display is right under them. Next in line is the touchpad, which is in charge of navigation and control. On the sides of the touch pad are the two selection keys, as well as the Call and End keys. The End key is also used for turning the handset on and off, as there is no dedicated key for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of Samsung U900 Soul we find the volume rocker and the USB port. The lanyard eyelet is also placed here, all the way down the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated camera key and the microSD card slot are on the opposite side of the handset, exactly the same way as in Samsung U600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the handset are completely bereft of controls. Opening the slider reveals the keypad and the microphone pinhole. The keypad proved quite a pleasant surprise but more about that a little later in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Samsung U900 Soul is the main highlight on the back of the phone. It only gets revealed when the slider is open. Next to it are the LED flash and the self-portrait mirror. As it turns out, the Samsung U900 Soul has quite a capable camera, which will unleash its potential later in the dedicated shooting part of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 880 mAh Li-Ion battery. It seems like a rather modest solution for such a power-hungry multimedia phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are delighted with the build quality of Samsung U900 Soul. It is quite obvious that high quality materials have been used. The brushed metallic front panel frame and battery cover also benefit the design greatly. All in all, the handset manages an exceptionally pleasant feel in hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: great picture quality but poor sunlight legibility<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul is equipped with a 2.2" 16M color TFT LCD display that supports QVGA resolution. It is one of the first Samsung handsets with a more than 262K-color screen. Not that it's that important, as the difference between 262K-color and 16M-color displays is barely visible on most cases. You either need a really trained eye or a special picture to notice anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself has remarkable image quality and brightness, but is quite disappointing in terms of legibility under direct sunlight. As a matter of fact, this is the case with almost all recent Samsung handsets. We can't help wishing Samsung did something about that. It's a real pity that almost perfect indoors, the screen becomes useless outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, whether you will like the display or not will greatly depend on where you use it most.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is the heavy texter's best friend<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Samsung U900 Soul was one of the most pleasant surprises to us. If you have been keeping track of our recent reviews you will know that dead flat keypads are not really our cup of tea. Therefore we didn't really expect wonders of this one. That's until we started using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad uses really large keys and small metallic borders between rows to ensure great touch orientation. Also, mixing up two neighboring keys is pretty much out of the question with the U900 Soul. The space between keys cannot be pressed and this way borders exist without damaging the design of the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also generally very pleased with the touch pad and the controls surrounding it. The sensitivity of the touch pad can be set to one of the three available levels. When the sensitivity is to its minimum the touch pad needs as heavy press, almost like a normal key. This can be useful for people who cannot get used to the combination of touch sensitive and regular keys. As for us - we always used the phone with the touch sensitivity to the maximum as it provides best touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature of the touch pad that we particularly enjoyed is the fact that you can configure the haptic feedback. You can once again go for one of the three levels of intensity and you can even switch it off if you prefer to do so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is really nice. It is strong and even and makes using the phone in dark environments a piece of cake. All this said, we can safely conclude that the keypad of Samsung U900 is really great and texters will truly enjoy the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making phone calls with Samsung U900 Soul is an enjoyable experience. Voice quality is great on both ends of the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung, as you always have some sort of dialing animation, or a choice of several ones. In the case of Samsung U900 Soul you have as many as six of them: Quill pen, Sticky note, two named "Normal", Living world and Theme. The last two vary a little according to the theme or your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search as spelling feature can assist dialing by looking up your phonebook for contacts whose names contain characters corresponding to the digits you've typed. The Samsung U900 Soul also automatically looks up contacts, whose numbers contain the typed digits. The two types of searches really allow you the quickest access to any contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did our traditional speakerphone test with the Samsung U900 Soul. Here is how it ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured recently. It performs on a good average level, ranking just about the middle of the table. You can find more info on the test itself and the other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface has seen some improvements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Samsung U900 Soul is a slightly improved version of what we saw in the Ultra II line of handsets. It allows greater customization and some new capabilities but nothing revolutionary. Apart from the touchpad, that is, but first things first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Soul's menu structure is typical Samsung . The screens here however change with nice graphical transitions and overall we really enjoyed its speed and responsiveness.The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display by pressing the confirmation center of the touchpad. You can also use the left soft key for that purpose if you prefer. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. The four directions of the touchpad have shortcuts of their own and these can be changed according to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, Samsung U900 Soul's stand-by display offers the typical Samsung looks. The top bar is reserved for standard readings like signal strength, battery status, network connectivity, ringing profile etc. The bottom bar features description of the functions assigned to the soft keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul also features the animated traveler background (uGo) with analogue clock we came to know since Samsung D900. It sets the background image according to the country where the phone is being used. The wallpaper is animated: birds are flying in the sky, clouds are moving etc. From 7 pm till 6 am night mood takes over: the sky turns dark, while houses get lit up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also another option for the wallpaper - you can select a number of photos that can run in slide show on the desktop. The transition effect can also be changed. On the other hand, we saw a feature we appreciated back in D900 missing in the Soul - that's the option to have a calendar display on the home screen in standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as either a 4 x 3 grid of icons or a standard list. Sub-menus no longer get visualized as pop-up windows. Instead they are directly accessed and all of them appear as lists. The much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, where the last used items and sub-items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu is also present here. We like it this way and it proves useful when you use a given feature more than once. Still some may have other needs and will have every right to disagree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also take a look at the video of the user interface of Samsung U900 Soul in our Samsung overview from the MWC in Barcelona</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization allows quite a number of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul surely doesn't like to get users bored. It offers a great number of customization options. The preinstalled themes are all very nice and we happened to particularly enjoy the one named Monolithic Purity. It perfectly blends with the brushed metal design and benefits the phone looks greatly. You can also create your own theme, tuning every single element to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the touchpad theme can be modified changing the color of every one of its elements. Desktop clock also has three different styles. All in all, Samsung U900 Soul has what it takes to keep the relationship alive for a long time. The thing we are missing here is the three different font sizes for the user interface. These were largely appreciated in the Samsung U600 and it is a pity they are not available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of U900 Soul is typical Samsung again. Up to 1000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Search as Spelling feature we mentioned earlier. Unluckily, Samsung U900 soul - much like Samsung U600 - searches only in the contact's first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that is now becoming pretty common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field, which can than be exported to the calendar as an event with only a few clicks. This is quite a convenient solution. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call logging department has also been slightly improved in comparison to the previous Samsung U-models. Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give you access to the same application. It has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls. Before those tabs were somewhat inconveniently separate but with Samsung U900 Soul this is no longer a problem. Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great with the Soul<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul handles all common types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. The first three share the same editor. You can covert your SMS to EMS by simply applying formatting or to MMS by inserting an image or other multimedia content. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try sending it later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS, 30 push messages, 200 broadcast messages and 30 configuration messages in the phone's memory. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the free memory only. There are about 110 MB available for these, which should be enough on most occasions. Incoming messages, like calls, can also be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very good. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 30 minutes to 1 day).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul's file browser is not the same as the one we are used to seeing in previous Samsung handsets. It lists all the folders from both the phone memory and the memory card together. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, if you misplace some file the handset will still handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Functionality of the file browser is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth one by one or multiple at once. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. The downside we used to find in some of the older Samsung handsets - the really slow memory card reading - is not the case with Samsung U900 Soul. It is fast enough to read the memory card and this won't bother the user at all. Listing thumbnails of the pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card now happens very quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul's picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening a folder that contains images. You can now copy or move images to any folder of your liking, unlike the previous Samsung handset where only the Images folder was available for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures are seen as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view a picture in portrait mode only, unless you apply the fullscreen view mode which switches the gallery to landscape. You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is quite slow and irritating.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editing in its full shine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's one of the most capable image editing applications for mobile phones. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung U900 Soul offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. We still doubt it anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with generous internal memory of 128MB and a microSD card slot, the Samsung U900 Soul has every premise to act as a portable music player. It is therefore important that the music player application be up to the task. Not that it's that hard of a task but still sometimes it's the small things that mess up the big picture. Luckily this is not the case with the U900 Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composers. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. The player in Samsung U900 Soul has undergone some changes when compared to, say, Samsung U600 but the functionality isn't greatly altered. It has no equalizer presets, but sound effects instead. The difference is that the sound effects also include wide and surround options in addition to the seven available presets. There are also three types of visualization and you can enable fading out on stop if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player makes best use of the touchpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is one of the phone features to reap the benefits of the touchpad. It gives you all the controls eliminating irksome labels over your video. Controlling the video player with the touchpad covers all essential features, including fast forwarding and rewinding, and these are easily accessed without going through menus. In addition, you can enjoy the videos fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder works in MPEG-4 format, so there is no doubt the player supports it. That makes converting your favorite clips and movies to watch on your Samsung U900 Souls a piece of cake. Plus, the great picture quality of the display lets videos be enjoyed in their full shine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A lot has been speculated about the integration of the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEPower amplifier into the latest Samsung handsets. Some claim it's giving Samsung handsets a definite edge in terms of sound quality. Well, this speculation is completely disproved by our audio lab tests. It is obvious that what ICEPower gives Samsung is reduced power consumption, not better audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, our tests revealed that Samsung U900 Soul doesn't differ that much from the good old Samsung D900 and the latter doesn't have an ICEPower module. This however should by no means be considered a criticism, as the audio quality is truly great. In fact, even though the Samsung U900 Soul is not really a dedicated music phone, it offers better audio quality than most of the handsets we've tested so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung U900 Soul lacks a standard 3.5 mm or even a 2.5 mm audio jack. You're therefore limited in your choice of headsets, unless of course you find a suitable adapter. Then again, you can use a Bluetooth headset - both mono and stereo will do, as Samsung U900 Soul supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A camera above all expectations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. As it turned out, photography is really one of Soul's strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface very much resembles that of Samsung G800. It is a bit more user-friendly thanks to the four shortcuts on the touch pad but still not really our favorite. However, the available settings are quite a lot so we are willing to forgive the somewhat complicated menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more important settings are picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, and frame), effects (black and white, sepia, negative etc.), white balance and face detection. The face detection feature itself works pretty well and is even capable of recognizing several faces simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional camera settings include wide dynamic range, anti-shake, picture quality and ISO settings. Exposure metering is also configurable and the auto focus can be switched off if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short video of the camera interface can be found in our Samsung overview from the MWC in Barcelon</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Samsung U900 Soul is what impressed us here. We especially appreciated the image processing, which balanced in-camera sharpening, noise levels and scene detail with remarkable results you would hardly see in any other cameraphone. The only noticeable problem we see with the camera is the occasional red tint, which we are used to see in Sony Ericsson and LG cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The activation of the wide dynamic range option doesn't help with the highlights, but brings in quite a lot of detail in the shadow areas at the cost of somewhat increased noise. Check out some samples showing what exactly this widely advertised feature does. Our guess is that you can do the same in Photoshop CS with the Shadow/Highlight function, but anyway it's a good feature to have in your phone. We are just not sure that the regular user will know when to switch it on. Having it switched on permanently is not an option since it doesn't bring any good to images in low contrast photo situations - besides it keeps turning off every time you switch the camera off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, impressed as we were with the U900 camera, we held it against the Nokia N95 8GB in an impromptu shootout. The latter has the best camera we've got to test so far, so there we were - curious if Soul would manage to outperform it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results showed that Samsung U900 Soul's camera was really up to the task, producing better pictures than the N95 8GB on most occasions. Samsung U900 showed lower noise levels, more precise exposure metering and better in-camera processing. Nokia N95 8GB strikes back with more reliable color balance and better edge-to-edge sharpness (thanks to its bigger lens). Considering that it wasn't a full-scale shoot-out, we didn't cover all the possible parameters but only the most popular. Announcing a clear winner wouldn't be fair to either contender but we can only say that we did liked the Samsung U900 results better even though it is still in beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recoding is concerned, Samsung U900 Soul didn't really manage to impress us. The highest resolution available is QVGA and this is no longer considered a great achievement. The videos might turn out usable on some rare occasions anyway. We can't help our disappointment as VGA recording would have been the icing on the cake for the U900 Soul's camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung U900 Soul you can count on 3G with HSDPA support and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. Leaving that aside, the 7.2 Mbps HSDPA is the quickest there is, so Soul users should count themselves lucky. Not that such speed is actually achievable but maybe in the years to come this will change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, Samsung U900 Soul also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. There is also A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone works seamlessly when transferring data to and from PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default or otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser limited in features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Web browser of Samsung U900 Soul leaves somewhat mixed impressions. We were glad to see a NetFront 3.4 web browser used, as we know what it is capable of. It turned out though its capabilities were seriously trimmed down in the U900 Soul. There is no landscape view mode and the page resize feature doesn't work that well. When reducing the size, the font isn't handled properly and any text on the screen becomes compressed to being downright illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also no trace of the mouse pointer we've been seeing in some of the recent Samsung and Sony Ericsson handsets, that use the same version of the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, pages are rendered well in both desktop and Smart-fit view mode. However, as mentioned, this only holds true if you are using the default page size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul's calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available for setting up: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important and private. Each of those has its own unique fields and an alarm can be set to remind of it. The Calendar can store up to 100 appointments, 50 anniversaries, 50 holidays, 20 important and 20 private events. Much like with previous Samsung handsets, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots on Samsung U900 Soul. Each of them can have its own snooze time, number of repetitions and activation days. The volume can also be different for each alarm and all but one of them can be renamed to the user's liking. The Wake-up alarm name cannot be altered. Furthermore, you can set different tones for each of the alarms and you can choose whether it should trigger phone vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world clock application, a calculator, and a unit convertor. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably seem appealing to sports-minded users. There is also a handy to-do manager that can help you organize your time better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in Samsung U900 Soul is the integrated document viewer. It supports viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files and handles them all pretty well. However, the application is so slow it ruins the whole experience. Both scrolling and zooming on documents does take ages and we find that quite annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul is quite a capable performer and the sleek looks are a well appreciated bonus. Having spent that extra time with it, we can still testify that the first impression holds. The Soul does have its issues here and there, which just couldn't have escaped the scrutiny of a detailed review. But hey, we won't be the one to cast the first stone. So, if you can put up with the small-capacity battery and the handicapped web browser, Samsung U900 Soul can just be your next favorite handset. Even at this pre-release stage, the U900 has a camera capable of remarkable picture quality. You can also enjoy the texting-friendly keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad of Samsung U900 Soul is not as capable as the InteractPad of LG KF600 but it was never meant to be. The Soul is supposed to impress with overall performance rather than one-of-a-kind functionality and it does the job, big time. With the release date just around the corner (14th April), all we're waiting for is the price tag. It's what stands between promising and bestseller.</paragraph>
