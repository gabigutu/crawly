		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With dual SIM still more or less a niche feature and considering the Desire line has been sliding down the ranks and losing value, people will have more than enough reasons to give the HTC Desire 600 dual sim the cold shoulder. Will it be deserved? Well, at least on paper, this phone may be worth of the benefit of the doubt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not a name that has a sexy ring to it but the HTC Desire 600 dual sim has the right genes, being a direct descendant of the One. More often than not dual-SIM designs lack inspiration, being a replica of existing devices with an added SIM card slot. This, fortunately, is not the case with the HTC Desire 600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, an extra SIM slot often involves compromise elsewhere -the HTC Desire 600 had to settle for the Snapdragon 200 chipset with four Cortex-A5 cores running at 1.2GHz and 1GB of RAM. This is Qualcomm's baseline product for 2013. We can't wait to see how it performs with Sense UI, but we'll get to that a bit later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, here's a quick rundown of the smartphone's key strengths and most notable weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps a 720p screen and 1080p videos would've been too much for the entry-level Snapdragon 200 chipset to handle. Other than that though, HTC has really tried to maximize the feature set of the HTC Desire 600 dual sim. The front-facing BoomSound speakers promise flagship-grade audio quality and, unlike the One and One mini, the Desire 600 offers a microSD card slot and a removable battery. The Desire 600 dual sim is still pleasantly thin at 9.2mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we've caught a glimpse of the pros and cons of the Desire 600 dual sim, let's see how it fares in real life. We're back right after the break with a full physical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the HTC Desire 600 dual sim<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes in a box that's identical to the HTC One's. It is filled with the exact same accessories as the HTC One - a compact charger with a detachable microUSB cable and a one-piece headset with spare tips. The headset is an in-ear design and has cool red accents and flat, tangle-resistant cables.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 600 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Measuring 134.8 x 67 x 9.3 mm, the HTC Desire 600 is easily comparable to the HTC One, which is couple of mm larger at 137.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 mm, but equally thin. Thanks to the lack of aluminum on the Desire 600, it weighs only 130 grams. That's 13 grams lighter than the One, which tips the scales at 143 grams. Although it may sound like a negligible difference, you can really feel it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned that on the outside, the HTC Desire 600 dual sim looks like an alternative version of the HTC One. A design concept that didn't make the draft, if you will. However, if its visual appeal wasn't enough for the premium segment, it's very well suited in the mid-range sector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 600 is made entirely out of plastic with no traces of metal. While we love metal-clad smartphones, there's nothing we didn't like about the plastic build of the Desire 600. The back cover is finished in matte plastic, which makes it virtually immune to fingerprints and provides an extra grip in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front, the plastic is of the glossy variety, but on the black version of the Desire 600 it provides a smooth contrast with the back cover. HTC has accented the BoomSound stereo speakers at the front with a paint job that makes their grilles appear as aluminum, but those are simply nice looking pieces of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going all-plastic means that the back cover is removable. It grants you access to the battery, the two SIM card slots as well as the tray for the microSD card slot. In our experience, the back panel is particularly hard to remove without longer nails. If you have more than two SIM cards and you happen to swap them regularly, the stiff back might start feeling like a uneeded chore.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that the HTC Desire 600 dual sim bears significant resemblance to the HTC One and that's most visible at the front of the device. It is there where you really get to recognize the design language that HTC introduced with the One and One mini. Unfortunately, the display lacks Gorilla Glass protection, which future owners of the device should keep in mind. A screen protector will go a long way in keeping this one safe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two capacitive keys below the screen - Back and Home - and a speaker on either side of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the top speaker is the front-facing camera (1.6MP / 720p) along with the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC Desire 600 dual sim features the Power/Lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack. A second mic for active noise cancellation is notably missing here. The bottom of the phone holds the main mic along with the microUSB port (note that this port isn't MHL-enabled like on the HTC One).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Desire 600 dual sim is clean of any buttons and ports. The right side features just the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera with LED flash is the star of the show at the back. The camera section is accented by a patterned plastic, where the camera and LED flash take the left side covered by a protective glass. Below it there is a large HTC logo, followed by a BeatsAudio one at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, back to the camera. It's an 8MP one with a BSI sensor that's 1/3.2" in size. It uses the original ImageChip found in older HTC devices, but is limited to just 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the back cover open reveals the 1860mAh battery. Above it, there are the two SIM card slot as well as the microSD card slot. All cards are very easy to pop in and out, so once you get past removing the stubborn back cover, swapping SIM cards should be a breeze.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.5" display of the HTC Desire 600 dual sim guarantees its easy handling, while the matte plastic back and quality materials used to build the phone make it very nice to the touch. The phone's back features a slight curve just like the One, so it fits nicely in the palm of your hand. Single handed operation is very comfortable and pocketability isn't an issue whatsoever. Overall, the Desire 600 dual sim is a delightful phone to handle and carry.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim is built around a 4.5" Super LCD2 display of qHD resolution (960 x 540 pixels). The pixel density clocks in at 245 ppi, which is ok for a midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the midrange is already home to some 720p-resolution smartphones out there, but the Desire 600 dual sim has to live with its resolution due to the entry-level GPU that's inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting the resolution aside, the Desire 600 dual sim display has great viewing angles and reasonably good colors too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, colors are a tad washed out and not as saturated as the ones on the HTC One mini, for instance, but on their own, they look just fine. The white balance on the Desire 600 mini is a bit too cold (bluish) to our taste, while the contrast isn't anything to write home about either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for battery life, HTC estimates the Desire 600 dual sim will be good for up to 577 hours of 3G stand-by time and 11h hours of 3G talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our battery test, the Desire 600 dual sim managed to achieve a cumulative endurance rating of the respectable 53 hours. For the full battery test breakdown, check out our blog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Outdated Android 4.1.2 coupled with modern Sense 5.0 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim runs Android 4.1.2 with Sense UI 5. It's a bit behind the curve with the more premium HTC One and One mini, which are rocking Android 4.2.2. Still, HTC has treated its dual-simer with some of its attractive proprietary software features such as BlinkFeed. Unfortunately, Zoe has not made it and it's reserved for the bigger boys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick showcase of the HTC Desire 600 dual sim software (and hardware) on video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launchers and relies heavily on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from a different brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you'd encounter it - it's a stream of articles from around the web delivered directly to your homescreen combined with account updates from the social network services you might be using, such as Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can long press on the homescreen or do a pinch zoom out gesture to enter the homescreen edit mode. Here you can add and remove homescreen panes, rearrange existing ones and set one of them as Home (the Home buttons brings you there). The only limitation is that you can't remove or rearrange the BlinkFeed, which is always the leftmost homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular paged interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons). You can use folders to group similar apps and make better use of the screen space. The other option is to switch to a 4 x 5 grid in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The Desire 600 dual sim doesn't have a Menu button, but you can assign the long press action of the Home button to cover for it. If you do that, you'll give up its default purpose of opening Google Now - which will be a swipe up gesture instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock Android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). There aren't any quick toggles for system settings, a feature that we very much miss. The other HTC phones running Android 4.2.2 already have that sorted out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the same goes for the widget lockscreen feature, which is present only on devices running Android 4.2.2 and up. As a result, on the Desire 600 dual sim you only get a traditional lockscreen with four non-customizable app shortcuts with the time and weather displaying above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no way to change lockscreen shortcuts independently from the ones docked on the homescreen. Many users may find that inconvenient - LG and Samsung both let you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has fiddled with the app switcher - it is now launched by double tapping the Home key. It shows a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails of the recent apps. The upside is that you don't have to scroll like you do in the regular Android app switcher, the downside is that you can't scroll at all even if you wanted to - you only get to see the last 9 apps and no more (for some that's quite enough). You can swipe up to dismiss an app (which leaves an empty slot, an older app doesn't fill its place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's Security settings, borrowed from the Windows Phone 8 playbook. It's called Kid mode and it is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim also comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense customizations also extend to the Settings menu - HTC has prettified it a bit with custom icons and added several new options (like Media output and Personalize).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're upgrading from another phone, you should give the Setup app a spin. It hooks up to your old phone over Bluetooth and pulls all the data it can, even things that Google doesn't sync (settings and such, not just the contacts). This also works for phones that can't sync with Google, like various feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu isn't dramatically changed in the latest Sense. It has the same design but the app icons and toggles have been redone. Other than that, all settings are where you'd expect them to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the HTC Desire 600 dual sim boasts a quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM, which isn't the highest amount ever put on a phone, but it is still respectable. Still, even with Sense on top, the phone ran its Android 4.1.2 operating system buttery smooth. The lower screen resolution sure helped here, but we also think that HTC has spent some time streamlining Sense UI for running properly on the limited graphics processing capabilities of the Snapdragon 200 chipset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean Google Now is available on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim. You can launch it by holding the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will serve information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget, which generates information for you based on what your interests are. You can put it on the lockscreen for at-a-glance info.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the HTC Desire 600 dual sim uses the Snapdragon 200 chipset, which is Qualcomm's entry-level chipset for 2013. It's a quad-core CPU chipset and while four cores may sound impressive on paper, the chipset performance is far from that. The four cores are of the Cortex-A5 variety and they all run at 1.2GHz each. The Snapdragon 200 also includes an Adreno 203 GPU alongside 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cortex-A5 cores aren't the best performers out there so we don't expect much from the Snapdragon 200 in the following series of benchmark tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has obviously kept things on a tight budget when constructing the Desire 600 dual sim, so they've picked the Snapdragon 200 as the cheapest current-gen chipset. Placing a Snapdragon 400 chipset inside it, would've put it directly against the HTC One mini and that's not what HTC is after here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let's see how the four Cortex-A5 cores perform under heavy load. Naturally, single-core performance is underwhelming, but multi-core performance isn't great either. In Linpack, the Desire 600 dual sim barely managed to float above the rock bottom of our list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 tests just about everything you can think off. Unfortunately for the HTC Desire 600 dual sim, that didn't help it bounce up from the bottom of the chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall performance is in a similar situation - AnTuTu puts the HTC Desire 600 dual sim at the bottom, while Quadrant considers it to be above last year's midrangers, but it's still near the bottom bracket as far as the current generation of mid-range phones is concerned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the low-end Adreno 203 GPU that's running the graphics department in the Snapdragon 200 chipset, we had to reside back to the NenaMark 2 benchmark. Unlike mid- and high-end devices, the Desire 600 dual sim GPU didn't max out this test, but it leads the selected 2012 mid-rangers by as much as 11 frames.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time to move onto web performance testing. We start with the JavaScript benchmark SunSpider. Here, the HTC Desire 600 dual sim browser is close enough to that of the faster smartphones, but you have got to remember that JS doesn't care for multi-core CPU architecture much. However, BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo show scores that can't really compete with the current batch of midrangers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While synthetic benchmarks are good for making comparison tables and all, the stuff that matters is real-life performance. IN this respect the Desire 600 dual sim performed quite satisfactory most of the time - it's not as snappy as Galaxy S4 mini, for example, but it does all the daily tasks done without annoying lags or long waiting times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs at the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs on the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the HTC Desire 600 dual sim has an extra SIM card slot, the software has been obliged to deliver the extra functionality. Firing the contacts app for the first time prompts you which contacts to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well by tapping the ellipsis button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook. These tabs can be hidden and rearranged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile. In fact, the phone will automatically suggest to do that when it thinks two entries are for the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is Block contact - the Desire 600 dual sim will block all calls, texts and other messages from that contact. You can add any number too, which is great if you get spam messages from an automatic number. You can later check the call and message history from those contacts and get them out of the dog house if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim did great in our signal test, providing great reception in environments where others dropped calls. The volume in the earpiece was extremely loud (we almost never used it at full volume) while clarity wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above, accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the Desire 600 dual sim - once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even switch to a QWERTY keyboard instead of the phone keypad. Another nice feature is the button that unveils all the contact info and lets you do just about anything - send an email, assign a custom ringtone and so on. It's a handy way to find and do something with the right contact, not just for dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the call button, which is now split in two allowing you very easily to dial a person with either of the two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is voice dialing, you hit the button, wait a couple of seconds for the Desire 600 dual sim to get ready and say "Call Dexter". This is a little too slow for our liking though (the phone says "Just one moment", pauses, "Say a command when you're ready" and then you can talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus of BoomSound speakers is not absolute loudness but quality of the sound. The Desire 600 dual sim mini scored an Average mark with results very similar to that of the regular HTC One, It's evident that HTC didn't skimp on the speakers, but still the Desire 600 dual sim is not the easiest phone to hear. Nevertheless, it's one of the most pleasant to listen to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Desire 600 dual sim are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Hangouts, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or half in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is pretty nice. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 4.3" diagonal offers enough space for comfortable typing. Some keys can be long pressed to get additional symbols, which speeds up typing in some cases as you don't have to keep going back to the symbols section of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa. You can also enable arrow keys, which show up below the portrait keyboard (but not the landscape one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prediction is available, even prediction for the next word you're about to type. When the phone has learned from you, it can get pretty good at guessing and saving you whole words. You can edit a personal dictionary of words and backup and restore it either to local storage or to an email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited. Voice transcription is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs like many other Sense 5 apps. You can choose the Filters setting and show/hide the ones you want or rearrange the visible ones. You can choose from All, Favorites, Unread and Attached (hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Gallery sans Zoe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes with the standard for Android gallery, complete with some perks thrown in by the Sense 5 UI. Sadly, Zoe isn't one of them, as it would be an overkill for the phone's hardware. Still, you get a very sweet set of features to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. Zoe can be used as a regular image gallery with photos stacked together by folders, but Events groups photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30 second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though it is possible to add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the Retouch section of the Photo Editor. There are also effects, frames and transformations available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can find a map with your geotagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player with very limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support. It couldn't play any DivX videos, XviDs refused to play, too, and MOV files were out of the question. AC3 sound is not supported, yet it managed to play MKV files in up to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a large display like that the HTC Desire 600 dual sim could really use some proper codec support to become a powerful tool for watching video on the go. Luckily, there are a few dozen video players in the Play Store to address that deficiency and some of them are even free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes with a custom music player, which is HTC Beats enabled, of course. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. That's not ideal, but at least the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front of the Desire 600 dual sim are quite loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here, however, not is there a playback control card on the lockscreen. The SoundHound shortcut will find out the name of the currently playing song for you and will offer to take you to a digital music store where you can buy it or lookup the song's lyrics or watch the video on YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 is not quite as loud as the One or One mini, but it can certainly match the smoothness of the output of its premium siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone did great in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. And even though it's not quite as loud as the One, it's still average at worst.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones either. The Desire 600 dual sim still has excellent frequency response, dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio, while the distortion is kept well under control. Stereo crosstalk does increase, but again it's no worse than average - a very solid overall performance for the midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard 8MP camera could've been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels in 4:3 mode and up to 3264x1840 px ones in 16:9 mode. It's only capable of recording 720p videos @ 30fps as a result of the low on power CPU. There's an LED flash / video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a wide f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip (HTC ImageChip). The lens is has a field of view equivalent to 28mm, meaning it's wider than usual and lets you squeeze more stuff into the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, or HTC ImageSense, is the same for both the still camera and the video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty simple, as well. There are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the settings shortcut button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the stock camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim camera has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the Desire 600 dual sim with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Desire 600 dual sim camera produces pleasantly looking images. We liked the level of detail ecen though we didn't quite like the overzealous sharpening that is going on. Other than that, noise levels are fine, white balance was spot on and the colors were saturated. Also, the camera captures images relatively fast so performance was not an issue at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a bunch of samples for you below, check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the Desire 600 dual sim offers a built-in HDR mode. Here's a comparison of a scene with HDR off and on. The results are far from perfect and it makes us wonder if this is even worthy of the HDR name. Not only are the shadows not very well exposed, but the exposure is completely off. Take a look for yourself below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Desire 600 dual sim joins the big family of 8MP shooters in our Photo Compare Tool. We've let it go against the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini as well as the Nokia Lumia 820, but as usual, you can pick your own preferred competitors in our tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video camera with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim can shoot videos at up to 720p resolution at 24fps. It has an HDR option for the video, but note that when you enable it, the camera's field of view gets narrower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a slow-mo video recording mode, which however is shot at a lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with an impressive 20Mbps bitrate - among the highest we've seen. Sound is captured in stereo with 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Framerate was at constant 24fps, but sometimes would jump to 28fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos seem okay in terms of fine detail, but they are not spectacular. What's worse, the oversharpening is even more evident and unpleasant here than in the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p video sample captured with the Desire 600 dual sim we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 720p sample (0:08s, 5.5MB) taken straight off the HTC Desire 600 dual sim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried the HDR video capture feature on several occasions but we failed to notice any differences between the resulting videos in the normal and HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 720p HDR video sample for you to see.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses a few things compared to the One<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim has the usual quad-band GSM support, plus several versions (for different regions or carriers) of 3G HSPA+ on one of its SIM card slots. The other slot is limited to 2G GSM only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the Desire 600 dual sim with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has backed in a simple SIM card manager application into the Desire 600 dual sim. It is dubbed Dual network manager and allows you to easily switch on and off either one of the two SIM card slots. An Airplane mode option is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim lacks a few connectivity options compared to the big HTC One - MHL and IR. Luckily, there's still NFC, which means you can easily send data to another phone (by a simple tap rather than the usual search and pair methods). No MHL means you can't connect the phone to a TV or attach USB storage. There's also not an IR blaster here for obvious reasons. This feature is left for the flagship HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are not necessarily deal breakers, but it's something you should know before you commit to the Desire 600 dual sim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser with Flash and GIFs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking. Pages can be reflowed to better fit the screen and you can set things like default zoom, search engine and URL suggestion providers and so on. From the Labs setting you can enable Quick controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces. There's a popup blocker to stave off annoying popups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes with full Flash support in the browser (it's disabled by default). We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. Flash has almost been weeded out of the mobile web, but there are still a few stubborn sites, so it's good to have as backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, while digging through the settings menu of the browser, we found that there's an explicit setting for GIF animations, which is disabled by default. GIF on Android has a spotty history, but keep in mind the Desire 600 dual sim browser support animations, as long as you enable them first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome browser also comes preinstalled on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim. Its interface is easier to navigate but it doesn't offer Flash support. On the up side, it can synchronize the tabs you have open in other Chrome browsers (on a computer, tablet, other phone, you name it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full Office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing is dully covered on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim. Office documents are handled through the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go. It's great to see a full Office suite when even some flagships (*cough* Galaxy S4*cough*) don't have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even added a VPN app, KeyVPN, which you might need for your work, so it's great to have out of the box (and for free).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC Desire 600 dual sim has five different types of view: Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Invites. You can swipe between different months/weeks/days like you would through tabs in other Sense 5 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invites view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's SPen - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the AccuWeather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC wallpapers, HTC lockscreens, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 600 dual sim has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Desire 600 dual sim, HTC has whipped up a new product based on the well proven old recipe - mix some good design with key brand features, and be frugal with the rest. They didn't forget some common sense commodities either such as the removable battery and the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not in the best financial shape possible lately, HTC doesn't have a big margin of error. This is the moment to overturn the bleak financial situation and HTC cannot afford even a single handset to fail. Well, even though dual SIM phones may not be mass market products, we have no doubt that with the Desire 600 dual sim HTC has a successful product on their hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a good-looking phone, with plenty of character that a lot of its peers seem to lack. Sure, it won't win any benchmark trophies. However, it's perfectly suited for the occasional gamer and will meet most users' web browsing and music playing needs. And that's especially true when you consider the dual stereo speakers. And despite the fact that the Desire 600 is not rocking an aluminum body, the plastic used is of great quality and makes for a solid build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.5" screen is very competitively sized even though it doesn't boast 720p resolution. Thankfully, it's just the low resolution that disappoints, as the display itself provides natural looking colors and wide viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arch enemy of the HTC Desire 600 dual sim comes from Korea in the face of the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini duos. While it packs a smaller, 4.3" qHD display, it's of the Super AMOLED variety, meaning superb contrast and punchy colors. The S4 mini duos also packs a more powerful, Snapdragon 400 chipset, which means its 8MP camera doesn't break a sweat shooting full HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini ? Samsung Galaxy Win I8550</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of aesthetics however, the Desire 600 is in a different league. The same goes for the generic-looking Samsung Galaxy Win. It trumps the Desire 600 dual sim with a larger 4.7" screen, but it's heavier and it does 5MP stills only, with video recording again capped at 720p due to the Snapdragon 200 chipset inside it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus L7 II Dual P715</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the LG Optimus L7 II Dual, which is considerably more affordable than the Desire 600 dual sim at just ?230, but you do get what you pay for. In the case of the Optimus L7 II Dual that's a smaller 4.3" display with a 480x800 pixel resolution and just a dual-core Cortex-A5 chip with Adreno 203 GPU. Its 8MP camera is limited to the pitiable 480p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it is lighter, more compact and its dual-SIM card capabilities extend to 3G support for both cards, which may be a killer feature for some of its potential users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia M and Xperia C are an interesting pair, providing an affordable and a premium alternative to the HTC Desire 600 dual sim. The Xperia C boasts a 5" qHD screen and an 8MP camera with 1080p video recording, but it would be hard to find outside China. The Xperia M is more readily available but offers only a 4" WVGA screen, 5MP stills and 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia M ? Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the recently underserved dual SIM market is an opportunity the major manufacturers wouldn't want to miss. HTC is about to release a dual SIM package with all the trimmings of the flagship. They have a more affordable option too in the Desire 500. The HTC Desire 600 dual sim is a package designed with attention to detail and targeting users who are willing to pay a bit extra for it.</paragraph>
