			<paragraph>At a certain point everyone finds themselves in the situation where all they need is a no-nonsense phone that looks good and doesn't cost a fortune. The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is exactly the kind - one of the sleekest, most affordable handsets by the Finnish manufacturer that has ever set foot in our door.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a distinctly youthful charm, the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic certainly won't replace your laptop but will give you all a mobile phone should. Offering the bare minimum might not be what your average geek expects from a phone but it is exactly what the market wants. The fact that the Nokia 5310 sold more than 13 million units is clear enough evidence of this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, not everyone can afford an N97 nor does everyone need it. What everyone does need however is good performance from their handset, even more so if reliability can be offered at a low price point. So we felt a thorough review of the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic was in order to check out this theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic might be a mass-market handset but it most certainly doesn't look run of the mill. On the contrary, it's one of those unassuming little gadgets that actually cash in big for the company. With such expectations on its shoulder, it is little wonder we are so curious to find out what this handset has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page to find out more about the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic hardware and design features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The retail package is acceptable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic comes in one of the smallest boxes we have ever seen. It's not that there is nothing to find inside, it's just that you can fit about four of those in the N96 retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the size of a ring box, the Nokia 5130 package includes the tiniest USB cable one could possibly imagine. Stretching to just a few centimeters it, can only be used with the phone lying next to the USB slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items in the box are a charger, a one-piece handsfree and a 1GB microSD card. It's strictly no frills but considering the price the box has everything you might need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5130 XpressMusic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing that struck us when we first got hold of the Nokia 5130 is that is has lost one of its most appealing features; namely, the slim waistline that has made the Nokia 6300 a resounding success and which worked equally well on the Nokia 5310 and Nokia 6500 classic almost a year later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic stands at 107.5 x 46.7 x 14.8 mm and even though it retains a modest volume of 65 cc, it doesn't feel as compact as its slim siblings. Now don't get us wrong - the handset is still almost as pocketable as it gets it's just that up until now a slim S40 handset has always equaled success and we can't see a reason for abandoning a winning formula.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight has also been increased to 88 grams from 71 g in the Nokia 5310. Most of these numbers however are unlikely to bother potential users and we don't find the difference disturbing at all when holding the two phones in our hands.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design is where the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic has a definite edge over the 5310, at least as far as our team is concerned. The shiny plastic on the 5130 looks and definitely feels a whole lot better than the opaque finish on the 5310 XM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the trendy dotted pattern on the back and the illuminated indicators over the music keys make the phone a whole lot more appealing, even if it's clearly aimed at a more youthful audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top half of the front panel is mostly taken up by the 2" QVGA display. It offers reasonable image quality with decent brightness and contrast. The vibrant screen is certainly helped by a pixel density comparable to some of the best on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither backlighting nor contrast is user-configurable. In the menu you can only set the phone's behavior in power-saving mode. An animated screen-saver can be set to appear on the display and, consequently, convert into a screen-saver showing a digital clock, the current date, and icons indicating missed events, if any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All these are perfectly legible under any lighting. Colors do get washed out in the sun but usability remains undiminished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is just the earpiece as the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic lacks an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left of the front panel we find the pleasant illuminations over the dedicated music keys. The keys themselves are on the side and those lights make finding them without turning the phone a whole lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the D-pad along with the four keys that usually surround it on S40 handsets. Those include two soft keys as well as call and end buttons. While the rim of the D-pad certainly could have been thicker, the fact that it is slightly elevated still makes it very usable even to people with larger hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We finish our tour of the front with the keypad. The 12-key alphanumeric unit on the Nokia 5130 is a fairly decent performer with nice tactile feedback and large comfortable keys. There is hardly any spacing between them and a terraced layout might have improved the keypad even further, but it's good enough as it stands now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia 5130 features the charger plug, the 3.5mm standard audio jack and the microUSB jack. Of those only the last one is treated with a small plastic lid to protect it from dust and dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone features the microSD card slot, which we managed to confirm has no problem handling a 16GB memory card. It took a while to complete the initial scan but handling it from then on was nice and quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other thing of interest here are the volume keys, which are decently-sized and generally no problem to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only functional element on the left side of the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic (in addition to the dedicated music keys) is the lanyard eyelet. The music keys themselves bear the same traits as the volume buttons - large and solid to press - we had no problems with them for the time of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is perfectly plain with no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two megapixel flash-less camera and the loudspeaker occupy the back of the phone. The loudspeaker lies beneath an interesting-looking dotted pattern on the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you will see in the dedicated section of this review, the lens aperture fitted on the back panel of the Nokia 5130 is made out of quite inferior quality reducing contrast in camera images. Those turn quite better with the back cover off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover is the 1020 mAh BL-5C Li-Ion battery. It is quoted at 6 hours of talk time, 288 hours of stand-by and an impressive 21 hours of music playback, which puts it somewhere between 5310 and 5220 XpressMusic handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its real life performance is also pretty decent with the phone surviving about three days of extensive use. While this number may seem higher than what most high-end competitors have to offer, bear in mind that the Nokia 5130 has no power-hungry features like Wi-Fi and GPS to drain the battery down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Nokia 5130 seems great with the high-quality of the plastic plain to see. While a week-long review can't tell the whole story, we're willing to bet that it's pretty durable as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The familiar S40 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 5130 classic has four different view modes: a grid of icons with or without labels, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons, our personal choice remains the classic 3 x 3 grid of icons with labels underneath. If you prefer more icons to appear on screen, you can go for the view without text that displays as a 4 x 3 grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can intuitively access the menu items through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by changing the active theme.The menu responds nicely with no lags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on the Nokia 5130. These should be enough to suit practically any situation you could possible face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no Flight mode to allow you to turn off transceivers on the phone and just use it as an MP3 player. Regardless of the price, this is an XpressMusic phone and not having that option is just plain odd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another weird decision is removing the active standby mode - a real treat in both S40 and Symbian S60. In return, the 5130 has only the four-shortcut screen mode, which we admit is sometimes helpful, but bears no comparison to the active standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Nokia S40 implementation used has long lost its charms and fails to adequately meet the increasing pressure from Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson. Those companies offer quite advanced feature phone interfaces including Flash Lite based UI themes, smart dialing, task switching for Java multitasking and office document viewers - not to mention their more elaborate image galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, as it stands now Nokia S40 is the underdog among the offered solutions. Nokia Maps for S40 that's available on the very latest S40 devices compensates for that to an extent, but it's still not enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook doesn't surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Nokia 5130 offers space for up to 2000 contacts. As usual, a variety of fields can be assigned to each contact but the phone numbers are limited to 6. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact, as well as personal pictures or videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most S40 phones there are three available view modes for your contact list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display either the SIM card contacts or the phone memory contacts - having both at the same time is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can also be modified should this be necessary, and it's an option that will be widely appreciated. Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A closer look at the phonebook menus reveals that the "Show on map" option is missing on the 5130, but well, the phone comes without Nokia Maps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: good but still no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, signal reception and call clarity have not been compromised in the Nokia 5130. The calls are loud and clear on both ends and you will have no problems communicating with this phone. Vibration strength is moderate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is among the many S40 Nokia phones to feature an active noise cancellation technology for suppressing background noise during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you were hoping for smart dial, you are going to be disappointed. It doesn't have it. It's about time though that Nokia introduced some sort of smart dialing in their feature phones as most competing manufacturers have already done so. It's quite convenient and might save the extra presses needed to get to the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 earned a 'Good' rank in our loudspeaker test. As you can see in the results table, the 5130 is noticeably louder than the 5310, but scored lower than the Nokia 5220. Subjectively, however, the Nokia 5220 sounded more than nice. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested mobiles here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log on the Nokia 5130 displays Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 messaging is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing has changed in the messaging department and honestly why should it given that it works just perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 5130 is capable of receiving and sending EMS, MMS, IMs and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do in order to turn a regular SMS into an MMS is insert a picture or any other multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. The size limit for both send and receive is 600KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does a pretty good job of meeting most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. Even Push email is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email setup is now as easy as pie - just enter your email address, and if you use one of the popular public email services (Gmail in our case, but the list contains about 1000 email providers), the handset will automatically fetch the settings for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's time for a new gallery, really!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once again no significant changes have been made to the gallery on the Nokia 5130. This is a real pity as we aren't really in love with the looks of the S40 gallery, the main reason being that it functions as a file manager as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic has 30MB of built-in memory expandable via microSD memory cards. The 5130 supports cards of up to 16GB of storage even though Nokia claim that it only works with 2GB cards on their site. There is also a 1GB card is included in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S40 Gallery has three different views: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom in on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest around (especially for larger images) and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a decent amount of options, but it's unlikely you'll be editing your photos on the Nokia 5130. There is also a slideshow option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual XpressMusic player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the most important applications on the Nokia 5130, so it's little wonder Nokia have put a lot of effort into its development. Not that they have made any great improvements to the functionality but the new looks are really nice and go well with the overall design of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated music keys also add a lot to the device. They are used for controlling both the music player and the FM radio, their functionality at a given time depending on the last used application. As we already said, the keys backlighting blinks to the rhythm of music if you enable the music light effects option. It's a feature we've seen before in the Nokia 5220 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides managing all the typical functions, the music player also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player is customizable through a number of skins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the A2DP profile is supported, allowing you to listen to music via stereo Bluetooth earphones. If you don't like the headset that comes in the retail package, you can easily change it for another thanks to the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But moving back to the player, we have to say that it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience can be enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. There are 7 preset equalizers on Nokia 5130 but you can easily modify two of them to suit your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM radio with RDS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music you have on your Nokia 5130 you can try the FM radio. It shares the audio player interface and can be skinned using the same themes as the music player. RDS is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nokia 5310, the FM radio on the 5130 doesn't have Visual Radio, a feature that enhances the radio experience by adding graphics and visuals to the audio content broadcast by Visual Radio compatible stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Nokia 5130 is compatible with 3GP and MPEG4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode also improves the viewing experience. Still, the 2" screen seems inadequate for truly enjoyable video-viewing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The best audio quality on a Nokia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5130 XpressMusic really did manage to surprise us when we got round to testing its audio output quality. Under the unassuming hood lays the soul of a real musician, certainly the best in the Finnish family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every part of the audio quality of the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is excellent, easily rivaling dedicated music players. As you can see from the table its scores are hardly too different from Apple's iPod Touch 2nd generation and we all know how good that means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response of the Nokia 5130 is simply great, remaining within 0.16 of the perfect line throughout the range. The distortions are also kept under perfect control and the low stereo crosstalk number is also worth noting. Noise level and dynamic range readings are pretty much as good as they get.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2MP camera to put faces in your phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's no flash or auto focus, but that's hardly a surprise on this type of handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is more of a complimentary feature on the music-centric 5130, as it was in the 5220 and other music-oriented devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are fairly limited but are still reasonable for this kind of shooter. They include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few things likely to disappoint - there is no cover to protect the lens from scratches, the lack of a flash rules out night portraits, while the fixed focus is sure to ruin any attempt at a close-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated shutter button is another downer when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose, especially when shooting in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is not the best as the noise levels are quite high and there are traces of oversharpening, however the results are noticeably better than 2 megapixel snappers by Nokia say? a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 camera captures only QCIF resolution video clips. While they can be unlimited in length, their quality and resolution is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's stereo Bluetooth, but no 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is at about the level you would expect in this price range. The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic has support for GPRS and EDGE to cover your wireless data transfer needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 2.0 is also on board for wireless short range connections. There is support for the A2DP profile, so you can listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB connectivity is really seamless. Thanks to the standard microUSB port and the supplied USB cable, connecting to a computer is hassle-free. Once connected, the phone memory contents as well as those of the memory card can be access on the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a microSD memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring information, is also present here. It's not hidden under the battery, so you can hot-swap it problem-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini for browsing the web<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini is the main and only pre-installed web browser on the Nokia 5130 and can be seen on all recent midrange S40 phones. The browsing experience is quite nice and thanks to the image compression it also lowers your wireless data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the browsing experience would have been much better on a bigger screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is typical Nokia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar brings no novelties either, and, frankly, it doesn't need any. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Also, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that lets you sort tasks into three priority levels. Tasks can be assigned an alert, as well as marked off once completed. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any day of the week and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze interval if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizer functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all decent looking and easy to operate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The familiar Java apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5130 comes with a reasonable number of preinstalled applications. The only thing missing really is the office document viewer that can be found on every midrange Samsung and LG handset these days. Nokia should start adding some kind of an office document readers on their feature phones if they want to be on track with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application gets you quick access to Yahoo! search. After setting the country or region you can conduct web search for images and other information. Find out more about the Search at nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Sensor application is a Bluetooth-based tool for detecting other devices in the vicinity and sharing information with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application worth noting is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also Share on Ovi integration, which has recently become widely available on most of the Nokia handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorry guys, but Nokia Maps don't come preinstalled on the Nokia 5130 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The prebundled gaming package on Nokia 5130 includes three titles - the trademark Snake III, Rally 3D and a revamped Bounce, now called Bounce Tales.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is small and cheap but has more character than you pay for. The remarkable audio quality and that extra bit of style should be more than enough for your money in any basic S40 package with a music slant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The previous Nokia competitor in this category was the 5220 XpressMusic, which we duly reviewed. With an almost identical price tag, it gets its edge from Nokia maps and flight mode. But speaking of edge, the asymmetrical design can be too hard to swallow for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For mass appeal there's Nokia 5310 XpressMusic. We guess we just need to pay due respect to the Nokia music bestseller. This phone looks good and does the music right and you have the word of millions on it. It has the same price and similar features and that's a good enough reason for the 5130 to set its hopes high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5220 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5310 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately to the XpressMusic lineup, the newly introduced Nokia 5130 is in for some serious competition by now elderly midrange Walkmans, which enjoy a golden retirement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sharp-shooting Sony Ericsson K770, sexy Sony Ericsson W880 and the conservative Sony Ericsson G502 all offer more user-friendly and better looking UI plus 3G support. The K770 camera should not be underestimated either, while its audio quality is not that bad either. Nokia could have had a winner there if only they did more work on the UI. Instead they even cut down its only competitive features such as the Active Standby and Nokia Maps - not to mention basic stuff such as Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson K770 ? Sony Ericsson W880 ? Sony Ericsson G502</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day Nokia 5130 XpressMusic is an excellent handset with pleasing exterior and nice to feel finish. Unfortunately the S40 user interface implementation on the Nokia 5130 is heavily outdated, while the competition hardly sleeping.</paragraph>
