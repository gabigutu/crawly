			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having covered the premium and the entry-level segment, Nokia is paying due attention to the midrange and hoping that it will pay off handsomely. The Lumia 720 was the leader of the company's lineup at this year's MWC and is arguably the company's best shot at extending its growth streak over the second quarter of this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 720 is probably the most sensible WP8 package the Finns have designed so far. For all its progress over the past year, Windows Phone is still largely considered as a distant third in the smartphone race, which is dominated by iOS and Android. That's painfully true in the premium class where Microsoft and Nokia have no meaningful response to multiple-core CPUs and 1080p screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The midrange however, is a more friendly game, giving the good-looking and decently-equipped Lumia 720 a reasonable chances for a shot at top spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, the Lumia 720 even has a couple of advantages over its premium sibling, the Nokia Lumia 920. First of all, the slimmer waistline brings out the best in the handset's design and the significant loss of weight is the best thing that could happen to the Lumia 720.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously the reduced price tag, required some corners to be cut and the Nokia Lumia 720 wasn't treated to a 720p screen like the 920 or even to the WVGA AMOLED display of the Lumia 820. Yet, the ClearBlack IPS LCD technology has done reasonably well for the Finns, so the Lumia 720 shouldn't be written off on account of having a screen that's just too ordinary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other line on the specs sheet that might cause concern is the downgraded chipset. While the 1GHz dual-core Krait CPU should be perfectly capable of ensuring a smooth sailing around the user interface and decent loading times, the 512MB of RAM mean that some application titles in the Windows Phone Store will be out of the Lumia 720's reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Nokia Lumia 720 seems to check more than enough boxes for its price tag, so it has every chance of selling big. It seems to have enough character, which is a rare commodity in the midrange, but we're also interested in its talents too. Join us as we set off to explore them. The hardware inspection starts right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 720 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 127.9 x 67.5 x 9 mm, the Nokia Lumia 720 certainly feels like it could've been at least a little more compact for a smartphone with a 4.3" display. The Motorola RAZR i, which is probably our favorite reference, is half a centimeter shorter in each direction, which makes quite the difference in handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Nokia Lumia 720 handles reasonably comfortably and is actually the slimmest Lumia smartphone to date. Considering the screen size, the less than perfect use of the available space is something you can quite easily live with, even if you don't have particularly large hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the weight, at 128g the Lumia strikes a great balance. It's not overweight like the Lumia 920 and yet it manages a reassuringly solid feel in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 follows the design language of the company's Lumia 920 flagship, employing a similar polycarbonate unibody. Nokia will be offering a range of snap-on covers too, which will enable wireless charging. Depending on the color you choose you will either get a glossy (like our white review unit and the red version) or matte (the blue and black versions) finish, but they both look pretty sleek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual appeal of the smartphone gets a boost of its pleasingly slim waistline. The subtly rounded Lumia 720 fits nicely in the hand and looks even slimmer than it actually is. The curved screen, a la Nokia N9, is much appreciated too, especially in sideways swipes, which are frequently used in the Windows Phone UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nokia Lumia 720 is certainly among the most attractive offerings in its class. It's a gadget you won't mind being seen with and one that might even make a few Lumia 920 owners a little jealous. And that's as good a compliment as a mid-range smartphone can hope to receive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 comes with a 4.3" ClearBlack IPS LCD of WVGA resolution. In the day of 1080p screens, its pixel density of 217 ppi doesn't sound particularly exciting, but the Windows Phone 8 platform is designed in such a way that the relatively low pixel density doesn't really show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course when browsing images or surfing the web the Lumia 720 won't be able to provide as much fine detail or fit as much content, but on most occasions the WVGA resolution feels perfectly adequate. Besides, there are only a handful of smartphones in the Lumia 720 price range to offer even 720p screens, let alone 1080p displays, so the Nokia mid-ranger has little to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more so, when you consider that its ClearBlack screen is excellently bright and provides very good contrast, as testified by the measurements in our test. Viewing angles are splendid, too, and while there's some color shift when you reach extremes, everything on the screen remains perfectly legible at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the display pixel arrangement under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility turned out pretty good, too, with the Lumia 720 easily ranking in the upper half of our chart.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls layout is pretty consistent among Windows Phone 8 smartphones and the Lumia 720 makes no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you will find a discreet earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three touch-sensitive buttons for getting around the Windows Phone 8 UI. The microphone pinhole is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sole element of interest on the left side of the Nokia Lumia 720 is the microSD card slot. It uses a rather unconventional design with a tray, which is operated with a clip, instead of the usual cap over a pop-up slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get busier on the right, where the volume rocker is located, along with the power/lock key and a dedicated camera button. The latter would launch the camera even if the phone is locked. All three keys sit relatively low and don't provide the best feedback, but don't really pose too great usability issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is located on the Nokia Lumia 720's top, alongside the micro-SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom of the phone, we find the microUSB port and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is where the Carl Zeiss lens for the 6.1MP can be found. Alongside it sit the LED flash and the secondary microphone. There are three small metal connectors lower down the back panel, which let you connect the optional wireless charging cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final element at the back is the loudspeaker grille, which is placed in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the unibody construction of the Nokia Lumia 720 means that there's no way for you to access the 2,000 mAh battery, which is located under the back panel. The battery itself is rated to last for 520 h of stand-by or 13 h 20min of talk-time on 3G networks, which sounded rather optimistic given its moderate capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much to our surprise, though, the Lumia 720 even exceeded its talk time rating in our dedicated test. The smartphone managed a really impressive 60h endurance score, which means you will only need to charge it every two and a half days if you do an hour of talk time, video playback and web browsing per day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft-certified user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is Nokia's primary smartphone OS (with WP7.8 dwelling in the low-end) and the Finns have taken care to add as much value to the Lumia brand as possible. That means exclusive apps and services rather than custom touches to the UI - Microsoft isn't particularly open-handed when it gets to UI customizations. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the interface should be pretty familiar by now, but here it is on video anyway:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications and images on the lockscreen. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps get to show less info ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind, the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller or an option to resize by dragging, like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking - well, not true multitasking, but more along the lines of iOS. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (navigation clients, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you start frantically hitting the back key, it will start closing all of the open apps, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has confirmed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 can also be controlled by voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice Actions, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner (HTC liked it well enough to put a similar feature on the One). You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info to help them with their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 uses the lower-end chipset of the two used by Windows Phone 8 handsets - Qualcomm MSM8227 (dual-core Krait CPU at 1GHz, 512MB RAM and Adreno 305) instead of the MSM8960 (1.5GHz CPU, 1GB RAM, Adreno 225).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Nokia Lumia 720 performs compared to the upscale model like the Lumia 820 according to AnTuTu. We've included results from Android devices too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book up to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to jump to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many friends and too many notifications waiting for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact too. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 offered loud and clear in-call sound and we had no issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 720 scored a Good mark. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem. You can read more about how we test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messaging hub on Windows Phone removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual emails can be marked as read/unread, flagged and unflagged, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mailbox for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. However, devs need to enable that into apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You cannot sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll displays your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. A photo can be viewed in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Music and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing their own music service called Music on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Music (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Music competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms and exclusive Lumia Live Sessions too. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2012, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central component of Nokia Music is Mix radio - it plays a mix of songs rather than manually selected tracks. You can also play your own music with this app and purchase albums and individual songs to add to your collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several advantages over the competition - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs near you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the Lumia 720 now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can shuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 audio output is almost identical to that the Lumia 620. This is to say not the best around, but certainly adequate for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 720 mostly managed good scores with the higher than average intermodulation distortion the only exception. Volume levels are slightly above average, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones isn't too bad. consisting in a moderate increase in stereo crosstalk stereo crosstalk and slight deviations of the frequency response. That's good enough for most, but the extremely demanding audiophiles will certainly find better options out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera with many features, OK image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 boasts a 6.1MP camera with an F/1.9 aperture, the widest on a mobile phone yet. The camera has a single-LED flash. The sensor is on the small side at 1/3.6", so we were curious to see how it performs. It's similar to that of the 820 and 920 in that it's a hybrid, handling both 4:3 and 16:9 aspects relatively well. It loses only 12% resolution when switching to widescreen mode, rather than 33% like conventional sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app. The Lumia 720 takes about a second between shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses are a powerful feature that enhances camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps. The available "lenses" are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen). A lens can add all sorts of new functionality - photo filters, HDR, histograms and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens, which is by far the most powerful. It uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pick the best face and go through every facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more Nokia lenses you can grab for free - Panorama (a sweep panorama), Cinemagraph (creates animated GIFs of a scene), Glam Me (enhancements for self-portrait shots), SophieLens (various photo filters) and CNN (to send in iReport photos and videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting Lens from Nokia is #2InstaWithLove - it creates an Instagram-like photo (there's only on color effect) that you can post to a global feed, a nod to Instagram to release a Windows Phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three more lens deserve a mention, these ones by Microsoft. Photosynth can create Photo Sphere-like panoramas though it needs work as it constantly got lost and asked us to start over. Blink does burst shot and implements image stabilization developed by Microsoft. Translator scans written text with the camera and as the name suggests translates it to another language (we've seen similar apps on LG Optimus G Pro and Samsung Galaxy S4).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As can be expected from such a small sensor, the image is grainy but the Nokia Lumia 720 handles it well. There's no color noise or signs of excessive noise reduction. There's a good amount of fine detail (with minor traces of sharpening visible). The colors come out oversaturated in good light. Still, we are happy with the results and we'd say that the Lumia 720 produces very pleasant photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of Cinemagraphs and a panorama we shot with the Lumia 820 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Panorama ? A cinemagraph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also decided to test how the F/1.9 lens does in the dark against a phone with good low-light chops so we took a few samples with the Lumia 720 and the HTC One in a poorly lit room. Photos were taken from the hand using both the normal and night modes, flash was set to off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 does okay as far as exposure and colors go, but without optical stabilization the slow shutter speed leads to motion blur. The HTC One produced sharper images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera is better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light. Better still, the video camera can use Lenses too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording app lacks touch focus but it does have continuous autofocus, which can be turned on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 shoots 720p videos in MP4 files at a bitrate of 10.5Mbps. Audio is mono at 96Kbps bitrate and 44.1kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video framerate is solid 30fps. The amount of fine detail is okay, though the compression does smudge some out. Colors are accurate, and while the automatic exposure is a bit too eager, the continuous autofocus wasn't intrusive at all (you can disable it too for very dynamic scenes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a 720p sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 720p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and quad-band 3G with HSPA with speeds of 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 2.1 (BT file transfers are also supported).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone memory and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your 8GB phone storage and microSD card, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 720 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also used for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 720 on top of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 got a major upgrade, but kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent. The Lumia 720 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing, but the pixel density is average, so text can get fuzzy at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran a couple of browser tests to see how the Lumia 720 stacks up against the higher-end phones with the more powerful Qualcomm chipset. The 720 isn't as fast as the high-end WP8 phones (which are some of the best performers in pure JavaScript speed) but does okay against Android. Things are even better for HTML5 performance according to the BrowserMark 2 test, which puts it close to last-gen Android flagships.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia isn't waiting around and has created the Xpress browser for Windows Phone, which does the web page compression independently of carriers (Nokia promises up to 85% savings). You can also save pages for offline viewing to further reduce data usage. Multiple tabs can be opened, just like in the regular browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser starts off with a screen with bookmarks called Quick links, but the Magazine feature is more interesting. You add several sites to it and Xpress will automatically pull recent headlines, an alternative to Flipboard and the like. Pages from Magazine are preloaded over Wi-Fi to both save on mobile data and make the open faster. Another nice features are Smart text, a quick lookup tool, and on-page translation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Live tile can be used to monitor your data usage if you're on a tight data plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 720 brings you to the Bing search app. At first it displays a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search field lets you use Bing to search the web, but there's more than just web results - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is Local Scout, which lets you search for various points of interest around you. There's the camera scanner too, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The third one is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store (formerly Phone Marketplace) is still catching up with the Apple App Store and Google Play. The number of apps available crossed the 100,000 mark a while ago and, while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that most of the top 50 apps are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 won't work on the older versions but all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8. One thing that might be a problem is that not all apps support devices with 512MB RAM like the Lumia 720. At least not initially, many apps eventually do get 512MB support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. Another section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as elaborate as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like the Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop 'till you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, and then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available in the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia HERE Maps and HERE Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table and they are more powerful than the default Bing Maps that other Windows Phones come with. Nokia recently rebranded their mapping and Sat-Nav solutions as HERE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia HERE Drive is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for your country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Nokia rebranded Maps it also split the app into two. HERE Drive that comes free with your Lumia 720 gives you a navigation license for only one country, depending on the SIM card you put in the phone. Drive+ gives you the global coverage, but that only comes on the higher-end models (it will be available for purchase for non-Nokia devices sometime in the future).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, that's one major thing to consider when buying a Nokia Lumia 720 - it can only be used for navigation in your home country, but not abroad. Even if you buy a new SIM when visiting abroad, it will not change the license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HERE Drive you can easily plan routes (no data connection needed) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers and even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia HERE Maps takes on other duties - it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what trusted guides like TripAdvisor, Lonely Planet, ViaMichelin, Expedia and HRS and more have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout app will locate nearby points of interest and it will even show you indoor maps of malls. The app has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone at a right angle to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia HERE Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer via SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can email notes too. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more detailed hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 720 may be sitting in the middle of the Nokia WP8 lineup, but it has features that elevate it above the average midrange experience. Starting with the sensitive touchscreen that works with gloves (like the flagship 920), the screen also boasts ClearBlack tech and a curved Gorilla Glass 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 also has the widest aperture on a phone yet, F/1.9. It's also the only Lumia thinner than 9.9mm, its battery is bigger than that of the 820 and it has expandable storage too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 720 may as well have struck the perfect balance - affordable price for features that will make mid-range Android phones green with envy. It does miss out on a few things, though. Its chipset is fairly capable, but 512MB of RAM can result in the occasional app incompatibility. You don't get 1080p video capture or LTE like on the Lumia 820, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the bigger disappointments was that it comes with free voice-guided navigation for only a single country. We've gotten so used to Nokias providing worldwide offline navigation, that this one took us by surprise. Still, it only matters if you'll travel abroad, for home country navigation it's still one of the best solutions around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 has to compete with the Lumia 820 for your attention. Both have very similar specs and each has certain advantages. In the case of the 820, those include the AMOLED screen with almost infinite blacks, the higher res stills and video camera, and the LTE connectivity. However, it has a smaller battery and is thicker and heavier, too. But the difference in price is not all that great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 820</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 is also an interesting alternative - it's cheaper, lower-end device, but uses the same chipset and a sharper 3.8" WVGA screen (246ppi) with ClearBlack technology. The still camera is only 5MP but shoots 720p video too. And there's 8GB of built-in storage plus a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8S has a sharper but smaller screen compared to the Lumia 720, WVGA resolution spread on a 4-inch screen boils down to 233ppi. It has the same chipset and a 5MP / 720p camera, plus expandable storage. Its maker-exclusive perk is Beats Audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 620 &#x2022; HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the Androids. A Samsung Galaxy S II Plus is a rehash of the classic S II with an S III styling. It has a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen (full RGB matrix), an 8MP / 1080p camera and it is slightly slimmer and lighter than the Lumia 720.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T is a former flagship with a bigger, sharper screen - 4.55", 720p, 323ppi - and a 13MP / 1080p camera, plus 16GB of built-in storage plus a microSD card slot. The chipset is faster than the S II Plus and Lumia 720 chipsets too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9105 Galaxy S II Plus &#x2022; Sony Xperia T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 720 may be some of the best work we've seen from the Finns recently - not a pricy best-of-the-best flagship, but an affordable, well-built phone that packs more than enough features to get users interested. It has its nagging flaws, but as an overall package it's hard to beat.</paragraph>
