			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Depending on where you come from, the iOS 7 may be the bigger, and better, piece of news than the new iPhone duo. Certainly true if you have the iPhone 5 and you intend on holding on to it, unfazed by what looks like a dilemma between a marginal upgrade and a candy-colored downgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not about the phones though. Not yet. There's two of them for a change, which means Apple will be keeping us busy with double the usual amount of hardware to review. However, we cannot ignore the fact that we took the first glimpse of the new iOS 7 this summer as a sign - a promise? - of a better, new exterior design to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, we liked the iOS 7 and, as it's about to start hitting the iPhone 4, 4S and 5 on September 18, we're taking a closer look at what's the biggest overhaul of the platform since it debuted in 2007. What makes it different this time is that we're not focusing on the new stuff but exploring the OS head to toe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with a closer look at the list of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know many of our readers are impatient to see what kind of difference the 64-bit A7 chipset is making and excited about the return of the fingerprint scanner to the mobile world. But while we wait for a review iPhone 5s to arrive, let's explore the final version of the iOS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic wallpapers and parallax view, along with live icons and the agile use of transparency are all part of the new design language but there's more to the iOS 7 than the modern aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a functionality perspective, Apple finally has connectivity toggles organized within the new Control Center, an iTunes radio streaming service, the notification center has been completely redesigned, there is AirDrop for easy sharing between different iOS devices, and an even more capable Siri.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are still features missing. And those will be duly noted as we go along. This review is based on the Golden Master build, made available to developers ahead of the full-scale release to the general public, and we have it running on an iPhone 5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 7 user interface: new aesthetics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, six years of user interface revisions and incremental improvements were obviously enough, especially after the uninspiring iOS 6. The UI that launched on the original iPhone way back in June 2007 has finally been put to rest. About time, considering the competition hasn't been sitting around either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 is not quite the game changer that the iPhone OS 2 and the App Store were, but the amount of effort that went into it shows. There're some key new features and cool system apps, to go with the complete user interface redesign and tweaks under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the personal supervision of John Ive, the iOS made the transition from skeuomorphic to flat design. And the great news is the UI changes didn't come at the cost of new features. We got connectivity toggles, file sharing, automatic app updates, improved multitasking with cooler interface, live wallpapers, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 looks a lot different to its predecessor, but its logic of operation is mostly the same. All of your apps are on the homescreen, folders are available and there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All system icons are different though, the clock now has an animated icon showing the current time, the system fonts have been altered, there are lots of semi-transparent elements and new gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the beginning - the lockscreen. It's totally different and yet it works in a very similar way. The slide to unlock bar is now gone and you can swipe anywhere on the screen to unlock your iDevice. The text is somewhat illogically placed right above the tiny arrow for the control center which points up, but you actually still need to slide to the right to access the homescreen. The swipe could've worked both ways, left too, but that's not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen also has the camera shortcut at the bottom, you can swipe up from there for quick access to the camera app. A double press of the Home key will bring the multimedia controls as usual. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can notice two transparent arrows at the top and the bottom of the lockscreen. Swiping from the top will display Notifications, while swiping from the bottom will bring up the new Control Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen out of the way reveals the revamped homescreen. The Spotlight pane is now gone - but not lost. It's just triggered by a new pull-down gesture anywhere on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are available as usual, but there is no limit any more on how many apps you can put inside them. Pages are available in the folders, each page can pack up to nine apps and there is no limit on the page count. And you can finally put the Newsstand app away in a folder! Hallelujah!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing of folders is now accompanied by a cool animation. Those do take a bit too long, though, and might become irritating once you are past their wow phase. We are hoping Apple shortens the animation a bit in the final version or at least give us the option to switch it off. A cool bit is the folder icons and the folders themselves are semi-transparent and their backgrounds adapt to the background's prevailing color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have already noticed the semi-transparent dock, folders, keyboard and Control Center in the screenshots. The Notification and Control Center colors are also adaptive, just like the folders, and they'll change depending on the background. So they might be blue-ish on the homescreen, but light gray in the web browser, or dark gray in the settings, or green in the gallery, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is less transparent and has only two themes - very light gray and very dark gray. Of course, they also change depending on whether your keyboard has popped up on top of a light or a dark background. Beside the new theme and font, the iOS keyboard is unchanged, which is not a bad thing as it's certainly one of the most comfortable around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dictation is also available courtesy of Siri. Just hit the dictation button on the left of the space bar and fire away. Keep in mind that the performance may suffer in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes don't end with those transparent and adaptive visuals. Opening an app involves a zoom in animation over the app icon, which is pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is observable throughout iOS 7. Apple designed the new iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, app pop-ups. The iPhone then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently and create an illusion of depth. The movement is very subtle. In fact, you might not even notice it if you are not looking for it, but it's there and it looks awesome once you start moving your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is not only available on the homescreen. You can see it in folders and in the pop ups that ask you for passwords or display notifications. Those pop ups by the way are also translucent and adapt their background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iOS 7 brings live wallpapers. You can find them in the relevant section of the Wallpaper Settings. Currently there are seven live wallpapers, but we hope more to become available in the AppStore as soon as iOS 7 becomes widely available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might have noticed in all those shots that Apple has ditched the cellular coverage bars and replaced them with five dots. The battery also got a new icon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS7 user interface (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple decided not to follow the competition and put the connectivity toggles in the notification area. They're in a brand new Control Center instead, that's pulled up with a swipe from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has five non-customizable rows for various shortcuts. The top row has five toggles - Airplane, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND mode and Rotation Lock. The second row has the brightness slider. Next come the media player controls including a volume bar. The fourth row has AirDrop and AirPlay shortcuts. Finally, at the bottom of the Control Center there are four shortcuts - one that turns on/off the LED flash to serve as a flashlight and three app shortcuts - Clock, Calculator and Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume slider is perhaps a bit redundant but nothing in the Control Center is customizable. It's a great, and well overdue, addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center has been redesigned as well. It now has three tabs - Today, All and Missed. The Today tab has the date, a summary of all events for the day, calendar day view, reminders, stocks and tomorrow's summary. As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Today's tab is customizable, you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All tab is basically the notification center of iOS 6 but sans the weather, stocks and calendar events. The first two are now part of the Today tab, while the weather is gone for good. You can disable the All tab for the lockscreen as well (just turn off Notifications View). If both Notifications (All) and Today tabs are disabled, the entire Notification Center won't be available on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Missed tab displays new emails, messages and missed calls, while your iDevice was locked. Those notifications are still available in the All tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed a bit. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can interact with notifications straight on the lockscreen. If a notification has just arrived, sliding to unlock will open up the relevant app - upon a missed call, you'll go straight to the phone app. You can also swipe a notification to perform a task - swipe to call back or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The banner notification is very subtle. If you receive a text in the middle of something, it will briefly pop up over the status bar and disappear in a couple of seconds, and not distract from what you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do Not Disturb is, as expected, still an integral part of the iOS 7. It gives users further control on notifications, or rather their suppression. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Apple, iOS 7 offers multi-tasking for all apps. Previously the true multi-tasking was reserved only for navigation or music streaming apps, the rest had to go in suspend mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this multi-tasking for all apps will surely drain the battery faster than Apple would have liked, so there is a catch. Yes, all apps will work in the background, but the iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's say you open the Facebook app every morning and don't use it for the rest of the day. The iOS will soon learn that and will optimize the app to work according to your schedule until you change it. This means most of the day and night the app will still be in suspend mode (push notifications will work of course), but the iOS will run Facebook shortly before your alarm goes on and load all the content. That way when you open it, your news feed will be already updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. This is a part of what Apple calls opportunistic updates - the iPhone waits until a data connection is available and starts the updates then, so it doesn't need to activate the connection on another occasion and waste your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We haven't spent enough time with iOS to give a proper judgment on how well the new multitasking works, but once we do we'll duly update this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is invoked with a double tap on the Home key. It looks a lot like the webOS cards of old and, more recently, the HTC Sense Task switcher - all apps are presented with cards that you can swipe up to close. Each card has the respective app icon so you can easily recognize what's what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking UI works in both portrait and landscape mode, but you cannot see more than three cards at a time. It's one of the limitations of the card interface and we suspect this is why HTC went for a different task switcher on the One, but here's hoping that Apple will at least fix the landscape mode down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 Settings menu has the same layout as in previous versions but updated with the new flat and borderless look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the Background App Refresh, the iOS 7 offers even better control over the apps that use mobile data. The Cellular tab offers detailed cellular data breakdown by apps and services, allowing you to properly manage your resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing worth mentioning is the Vimeo and Flickr integration in addition to Twitter and Facebook. Once you enter your account details in the settings you can upload your photos straight to your Flickr gallery, while your videos will go to your Vimeo. You just need to hit the share key on a picture or a video and use the dedicated Flickr/Vimeo icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last major change about the user interface is the Back gesture available in all iOS 7 default apps (maybe developers will be able to extend the support to third-party apps after launch). Whether you are in settings, App Store, Messages, Notes, Reminders, Safari, etc. a swipe from the left side of the screen will take you one step back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook gets a new look, blacklist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has been updated with the new iOS borderless look and simple color scheme. The logic behind the phonebook app is completely the same though, there is just one new feature - Blacklist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either add contacts to the blacklist from the Settings menu, or you can simply go to a contact and hit Block this Caller key at the bottom. Once blocked you will no longer receive calls, FaceTime and messages (SMS, MMS, iMessages, emails) from this contact. You can of course unblock them at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the phonebook offers Facebook and Twitter integration. After you set up your accounts the phonebook will automatically ask you to link your existing contacts with their social ones (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can search via the dedicated Search field at the top of the list of contacts or you can use the alphabetical scroll at the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is intuitive and gives you the option to include lots of additional fields, like several addresses, related people, web, email, birthdays, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set different ringtones, message tones and vibration to your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since iOS 6 your iMessage and FaceTime ID is joined and the phonebook will automatically detect if either service is available with each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony, FaceTime audio calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The incoming call and in-call screens have gone flat too. The dialpad itself looks different, though it brings no new usability features. Smart dial is sadly, still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can reject calls via SMS since the last iOS update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the phone to remind you to call back a person at a location or when you're leaving the current one, which is a nifty trick. Keep in mind that doing so will invoke constant use of GPS, which could in turn lead to a significantly reduced battery life but the phone would probably still last a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime comes as a system app in iOS 7 and looks just like the Phone app. It works both over a cellular data or Wi-Fi. The service now offers voice calls too, in addition to video conference. With FaceTime audio calls and iMessages, iOS users won't need Viber as much to connect with other iOS users free of charge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages and Mail got only new looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app also gets the new iOS skin. It adds a new option in the conversation view - Contact. If you tap on this key, you'll get options to Call and FaceTime that user, or go to their phonebook profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5 or later running iGadgets over Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green. A cool thing about them is that each conversation is synced with the iCloud so you'll have it right there and available on all your iDevices, including your Mac (although synchroniszation is not flawless and the time stamps would get messed up at times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. Adding multimedia is done either by hitting the small picture icon next to the text field or through the sharing menu in the gallery or supported apps (Voice Memos, Notes, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mail client has the new looks but the functionality is unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIP lists are available - emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in the regular inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also flag important emails. After you flag your first message, a new Flagged mailbox will appear gathering all of your flagged emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching pictures and videos while composing an email is possible since the iOS 6 - just tap and hold on an empty space and use the popup menu. Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are available in the text editing options, as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold and select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting. Finally there is a built-in dictionary. It's very rich in content and conveniently works offline.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Completely redesigned Photos app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has been redesigned more thoroughly. To begin with, the Photos tab looks better organized. Prior to iOS 7 we used to get a grid of all of photos there, sorted by date. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geotagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moments view offers multiple photos selection - you can select an entire folder with just a single tap. Mass Delete, Share (including AirDrop) and Add To Album options are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a city label in Moments or Collections will take you to the old Places view, where you get a map with pins showing where exactly your photos were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Shared photos - it has all your Photo streams. Photo Stream, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Streams with via email or get invited. But all that is not new. What is new in iOS7 is that your friends and family can now add their own photos to the Shared photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third tab is albums. You get three default album types - camera roll, my photo stream and panoramas. Albums can be added, edited and deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full size and you can delete, share or edit them. From the sharing menu you also get advanced options such as copy, assign to contact, slideshow, print, use as wallpaper and AirPlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can AirDrop multiple pictures from this interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor is the same as before with a new option to add filters. It supports rotation, cropping, filters and red-eye removal. There's also an Enhance option too. In Edit mode five keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same old video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media format or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and iTunes Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cover Flow is gone for good replaced by the new Album view - you access it by flipping the device landscape. It lists all the covers to the albums you have in your library. Tapping on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Even in its seventh major iteration iOS still fails to offer configurable equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more countries after the iOS 7 launch), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with the entire iTunes content available for streaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stations are divided by genres, but once you add a station, you can choose to remove artists or add more songs from an artist/group. You can preview a station before adding it to your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you like a particular song, you can buy it with just one tap. History is available and you can always return to buy songs later. A Wish List is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Radio is ad-free if you are using iTunes Match. Otherwise, every 7 to 10 songs are broken by about 15sec of commercials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New camera UI, filters with live preview now available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera app has been completely rewritten. There are four modes available - Video, Photo, Square and Pano. There is no dedicated switch for those, you need to swipe to get to the desired camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no image settings besides the flash and HDR toggles, but there are 8 filters with live preview available for the Photo and Square modes - Mono, Tonal, Noir, Fade, Chrome, Process, Transfer and Instant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use filters and take square photos with the front camera as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera supports AF/AE lock as usual with tap and hold on the viewfinder. There are no resolution settings though, nor are there video resolution options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - AirDrop, iCloud, Activation Lock, iOS in the Car<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is one new feature in the iOS 7 connectivity department - AirDrop. It's a system-wide file sharing service between supported iDevices. AirDrop needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout the iOS 7. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select people and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop won't work with other phones and PCs, but will work on Macs running on OS X Mavericks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is continually improving its Find My iPhone service. The latest iOS 7 updates it with the so-called Activation Lock. This will not only protect your personal data but also make your iDevice inoperable once wiped unless you enter your Apple ID. This means the stolen or lost iGadgets will be of no use to thieves or finders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud was an integral part of iOS 5 and is present here in iOS 7. It syncs all of your important data between all of your devices running iOS 5 or above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 5 GB of free storage but you can buy more if you want. Selecting which apps to sync is pretty easy. iCloud even remembers each device you've backed up so you can restore them separately if you wish. You can naturally delete older backups to free up space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has records on exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple keeps tabs on this for each of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say, you have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 1.5MB. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural process to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then, by default, the whole content will be backed up too, eating your backup quote quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature from the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has announced a new connectivity mode that will be supported in a wide range of vehicles, starting in 2014 - iOS in the car. You will be able to see your iPhone screen on your compatible car display. And you will be able to control it via your car controls or just tell Siri via your car audio system what it is you want it to do for you on your iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will be able to use navigation, dictate messages, make calls, play music or iTunes radio, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the confirmed car manufacturers to integrate the new service are Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Ferrari, Chevrolet, Infiniti, Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, Opel, Jaguar and Acura.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Safari browser gets unified search field<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has finally updated the Safari browser. Yes, it got flat looks and 3D tab switching, but that's just the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice is the unified search/address field. These are no longer two separate fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next long-awaited feature is the fullscreen mode in portrait view, which auto-hides the browser controls. Open in background handy options premieres as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari finally supports more than 8 simultaneously opened web tabs. We quit trying to reach the new limit (if there is one) at around 22. The tab switching interface is a 3D arc where you swipe a tab left or right to close it. You can rearrange the tabs, you can add new ones or switch to private browsing. It's certainly looks good but it's a departure from the flat design language seen elsewhere on iOS7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch to private browsing, you'll need to either close all current tabs or migrate them to Private as well. It's not possible to have private and non-private tabs open simultaneously like in Google Chrome. When you are browsing in Private mode, Safari switches to a dark gray color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open your History you'll find a new tab called Shared Links. Here you'll find all links from your Twitter timeline, with authors and comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari in iOS 7 supports an in-device keychain, which stores store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. As of iOS 7 Gold Master release, the mobile keychain does not sync to your Mac's keychain so these vaults remain separate and you would have to input the login information twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud syncs your opened tabs however, along with offline reading. Safari also allows you access to your multimedia content without exiting the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and fontsize more suited to a smaller phone screen. And best of all, if you are reading a multi-page article (such as our reviews) getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two controls at the top, and also there's a built-in dictionary to look up unknown words.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app has been revamped as well and has a very useful new feature. You can now drag and drop events if you want to move them to different days. Just tap and hold on an event and you can move it to a different day and hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits greatly from the Facebook integration. Birthdays and events from Facebook are immediately synced with your calendar but you still get the option to omit them from the Calendars tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view by list (iOS's agenda variant), day and month. There's also a toggle to get back to today if you've strayed too far back or forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting your device to landscape orientation automatically opens up the weekly view, which lists all of your events in a side-scrollable fashion. Events are color-coded so you can recognize what's what with a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event is done the same way as before. You can choose which calendar you want the event to be synced with, add a location, additional notes and set up an alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Calendars tab. You can customize the iCloud personal and job-related event colors to your liking. You can also create additional calendar entries, for example if you have two jobs (or projects), etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders interface has been changed as well. It comes with three default lists - Scheduled, Calendar and Reminders, but you can create your own lists as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a reminder is easy. The available options are time, place, repeat, priority and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator has a stylish flat new look but no new functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the refreshed Note app. You can share, copy and print notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app has got the new skin as well. It has world clock, alarms, stopwatch and timer. You can set any of the songs in your music library as an alarm sound. You can also choose from your custom ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app has had a major update. It now offers live weather animations, a lot more weather information plus the time of sunrise and sunset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom out and get to the cities view, which would show the weather in all the locations you have stored at the same time. Live animations are also available in the city preview. Night-time specific animations are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compass app, besides the new interface, got some new functionality too. If you swipe to left you'll get an inclinometer. Unfortunately, the inclinometer only measure one of the angles of inclination, rather than both, so it's probably too early to retire your dedicated app. The Stocks app has new color scheme and UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Memos are available as well. You can capture practically unlimited voice memos and send them to others via a message or mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks offers various font and color settings, but on a screen this size, it's just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and on a mobile phone that doesn't quite make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PassBook is an e-ticket app that handles all kinds of electronic tickets and reservations (including boarding passes), loyalty cards, coupons, etc. It's Apple's answer to apps like Google Wallet but without the additional NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware app makes the right coupon available in the right place and at the right time. The PassBook will report the balance on coupons and cards, let you check your ticket seats and can even show you relevant notifications (e.g. gate or terminal change for a flight).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Siri accepts more commands, has new voices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new iOS version just can't afford to pay no attention to Siri. After more than two years in development the assistant has finally graduated from beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the rest of the iOS 7, Siri now looks different. It always launches in full-screen and has a real-time voice graph. Another UI novelty is the option to edit your voice request with the keyboard in case Siri didn't hear you right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri supports and uderstands English (American, Canadian, Australian, British), French (France, Canada, Switzerland), German (Germany, Switzerland), Japanese, Italian (Italy, Switzerland), Spanish (Mexico, Spain, US), Mandarin (China, Taiwan), Korean, and Cantonese (Hong Kong) languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important Siri upgrades, of course, are under the hood. Siri now has Twitter and Wikipedia integration and it offers new voices, there is both female and male English US for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can also carry out commands affecting the iOS - it can turn Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on/off, increase brightness, play voicemails, check other people's social network status, play iTunes Radio stations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is a really powerful voice assistant capable of POI search. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri also answer slots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser. The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has replaced Google with TomTom as map provider for the iOS native Maps application. It also offers voice-guided navigation courtesy of Siri. The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also crowdsourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road. Sadly, there isn't an option to pre-cache maps for offline use, which can be a problem if you need guidance abroad or when you don't have signal. Still, if you set up a route when you have internet access, Maps will cache the maps needed to guide you along the way so you can finish your trip even without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of iOS 7, the navigation service also includes turn-by-turn walking directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is quite limited, but more and more areas are joining Flyover in time. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Maps launched with iOS 6 it was quite a disappointment because of its poor map data, but Apple managed to deal with most of the problems and lack of data and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you prefer the good ol' Google Maps, it is available for free in the App Store and is on par with its Android version. You get voice navigation where available, offline map caching, Street View, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App Store now has automatic updates, nearby apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS App Store is still the richest application store to date. It uses a tabbed interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Featured pages with scrollable rows is available as well as the usual Charts (Top Paid, Free and Grossing apps), Search and Updates. There is on new tab that replaces Genius - Near Me, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings one more feature that users have been asking for - automatic app updates. Once you turn it on in the App Store settings, your apps will update automatically (via Wi-Fi only) and you'll get notifications for the completed updates in the notification center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to use the automatic app updates, the Updates tab in the AppStore will display a list of all recent updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store offers another new feature - Nearby apps. Here you'll find the most popular apps people have downloaded in your current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store has a new hidden extra that will be appreciated by those using iTunes gift cards. You can now scan the card codes with you camera right in the App Store interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view all the apps you've bought on your current iDevice or previous ones through the Purchased menu in the Update tab. iCloud plays a key part here - all of your purchased apps from each device show up and are ready for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. It has a similar tabbed interface like the AppStore divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple is also offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection on the computer and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store. If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So iTunes scans yours songs and pushes them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with higher quality (256Kbps). The iTunes Match service costs $25(US) or ?25(EU) a year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Game Center gets a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honestly, the Game Center has always looked awful. Apple finally did something about it and we like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Game Center offers pretty much the same functionality - it has your games, your friends and your challenges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like all things Apple, there is no way that everyone will love the new look. It's always like that with major redesigns - even if everything about the new look was perfect, there would always be a large group of people to hate it for various reasons. What matters is though, this time we get a completely new design aesthetic and a host of cool new features that really make a difference from a user perspective - exactly what Apple used to stand for at its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In its 7th iteration, the iOS is well past the stage of incremental revisions and finally looking fresh again. Most of it is eye-candy really - maybe too much for some people, and a welcome excuse for others to voice their displeasure with the new OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of visuals, the parallax effect and transparency in menus are quite subtle and stylish. They're design elements that will make sense and go well with the overall conservative styling of the iPhone 5, and by extension 5S. The icons though are a bit too much perhaps. We couldn't help the thought that the new iOS 7 was designed with the colorful iPhone 5C in mind. We can't be certain of course, but it may as well be the other way around - which is a compliment for the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for features, the iOS 7 has over-delivered - considering we're talking Apple after all. The adaptive multitasking allowing more user control than ever before, the new Control Center with toggles and the swipe-to-go-back in submenus and even the updated Notifications are worthy additions for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested the iOS 7 on an iPhone 5, it's worth noting that the response is a tad slower compared to how the same thing behaved running iOS 6. In all likelihood, it's more down to the new animations taking a fraction of a second longer, rather than an actual system lag. This will probably be a non-issue for the iPhone 5S and its new hardware. As usual, Apple has its way of showing you that your devicehas come of age now (even if you've only had it for several months).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the new design and features will inevitably be compared to competing platforms but, weary comments about how long others have had this and that aside, it looks like the hardware (read iPhone 5S and 5C) has more to worry about the comparisons than the software, which at this point seems a job really well done.</paragraph>
