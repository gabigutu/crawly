			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is the Motorola Droid Turbo - Motorola's strongest claim at the high-end throne yet. Built around the strong foundation of the Moto X (2014), Nexus 6 and Motorola's previous Droids it pools together a premium build, pure Android with exclusive features and impressive battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Droid Turbo is everything we were hoping for with a 5.2" display of QHD (1,440x2,560px) resolution and massive 565ppi density, a top of the line Snapdragon 805 chip, 3GB of RAM, 21MP main camera. To add a bit of character the Droid Turbo comes in Ballistic nylon or Metalized Glass fiber reinforced with DuPont Kevlar fiber and a water-repellent nano coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Think of this as the powerful middle ground between the Moto X (2014) and Nexus 6 - smaller but also much, much bigger. Here are the highlights Droid Turbo's crossbreed specs:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Droid Turbo at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola is going for the gold this year. It brought us a new, truly flagship Moto X, its first Nexus (which braves crowded phablet realm) and now it tops both (in a way) with the Motorola Droid Turbo. And while "turbo" monikers are outdated, the word perfectly describes the fire-breathing nature of this device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Moto X (2014) lacked, the Droid Turbo has in reserve. Snapdragon 801 is still worth its salt nowadays but Snapdragon 805 is the new champ. Motorola isn't taking its chances with mediocre battery life here - the potent 3,900mAh capacity promises insane, Droid Maxx-worthy longevity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Droid Turbo comes with nearly stock Android, ensuring a snappy performance. It should offer timely updates (that is if Verizon obliges), but it's starting a lap behind the Nexus family with 4.4 KitKat out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's every chance that the Droid Turbo might sway Moto X (old and new) onlookers and shift their affections towards Turbo's direction. Hopefully Motorola won't keep the Droid Turbo confined to just one carrier in one country, otherwise they will be left with just looks of envy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wishes not withstanding, the Motorola Droid Turbo will make its way exclusively to Verizon customers starting October 30. It will cost $199.99 for the 32GB and $249.99 for the 64GB with a two-year commitment. There will also be a monthly option at $25 or $27 per month on Verizon Edge, respectively. The 32 gig model will come in Metallic Black, Metallic Red, and Black Ballistic Nylon while the 64GB will launch only in Nylon garbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we need to show you the Motorola Droid Turbo and believe us, you want to see it. Next up is a look at the hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Droid Turbo hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Droid Turbo is a beefed up Moto X (2014) dressed in a military apparel. It's tough and built to last with the company offering two flavors of the phone - one with Ballistic nylon and the other with Metallized glass fiber. The latter is reinforced with Kevlar, akin to previous generation Droids. Sounds highly engineered though we're yet to see the ruggedness of the phone in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone boasts an impressively 5.2" AMOLED display with QHD resolution. The math works out to 565ppi, bested only by regionally-limited Galaxy S5 versions with 5.1" QHD screens. Anyway, the display is covered with a protective coating of Gorilla Glass 3 to ward off scratches. The Droid Turbo isn't afraid of water either as its innards are covered with water-repellent nanocoating and it can last up to 1 minute under 6 inches of water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Visually, the two versions of the phone look cool, we especially dig the Kevlar back. The red color option looks great in person, very aggressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Droid Turbo feels great in hand thanks to its curved design. The two material options differ slightly in dimensions and weight. At its thinnest point, the Black nylon version measures 8.3mm, while the Metalized fiber is a bit thinner at 7.8mm. They weigh 176g and 169g respectively. With its above average weight the phone feels substantial in hand, the build is solid and gives the impression it will last a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last claim is for more than just the physical durability, Motorola promises the Droid Turbo will last up to 48 hours of mixed usage thanks to the large 3,900mAh battery. In the package, the company includes a Turbo Charger which will give you up to 8 hours of usage only after 15 minutes of charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Droid Turbo climbs towards the top of the performance ladder thanks to the Snapdragon 805 chipset with a 2.7GHz quad-core Krait 450 CPU and 3GB of RAM. The QHD screen resolution won't be a problem for the Adreno 420 to push around (the GPU is clocked at 600MHz). Android 4.4.4 KitKat absolutely flies, everything is smooth and responsive, check out our benchmarks on the next page. We feel that the Droid Turbo could have packed Android 5.0 Lollipop, all we have right now is Moto's promise to upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the rest of the software, Motorola likes to keep things as close to stock as possible while sprinkling some nice features here and there. The Droid Turbo benefits from this recipe with features like Moto's Display app, which wakes the screen when you reach for the phone and shows you the time and pending notifications. Verizon has left its mark too with the Droid Zap app for easy picture and video sharing. You can also use it to cast to a TV using Google Chromecast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the phone offers 4G LTE Cat 4 (downloads up to 150Mbps), Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC. It comes with quad-band GSM and quad-band HSPA+ support for roaming outside Verizon's CDMA network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 21MP camera offers 4K video recording at 24fps, you can see a bunch of camera samples we took with the Droid Turbo on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Droid Turbo camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola developed a camera especially for the Droid Turbo. It may not be optically stabilized like the Nexus 6 camera but it goes after Sony's Xperia Z family with a 21MP sensor. It sits behind a wide f/2.0 aperture and is accompanied by a dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera sensor shoots 4(cat) photos (5,248x3,936) but you can switch to 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio at 15.5MP (5,248x2,952).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped three quick samples with the camera but it's way too early to talk image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For video capture the Motorola Droid Turbo manages 2160p at 24fps. We don't know why Moto didn't go for 30fps (the Snapdragon 805 can certainly handle it) and there's no high-fps mode at 1080p, just the usual 1080p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample captured with Motorola Droid Turbo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a UHD video captured by the device. See it below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device captured slow-motion videos in 720p only. It stretches 10 seconds of video capture in about 40 seconds of footage. Here is a sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Built upon a Snapdragon 805 chipset with a quad-core 2.7GHz Krait 450, 3GB of RAM and the Adreno 420 graphics processing unit the Motorola Droid Turbo should be a true benchmarks champ. We've found that a mostly pure Android helps a lot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And indeed it is - the Droid Turbo utilizes its hardware very well and managed to top immediate competitors in GeekBench 3. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4, for example, has the same chipset and screen resolution, OS version too. The Motorola also managed to outdo the 64-bit Apple iPhone 6.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Droid Turbo easily topped our AnTuTu 5 comparison as well. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 stays a close second to Motorola's latest flagship. Snapdragon 801 smartphones are left in the dust of the newer chip's performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark X and Basemark OS II scores by Motorola Droid Turbo came out impressive as well. See them below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As expected, the device?s Adreno 420 GPU does a good job in handling the multitude of pixels. The newcomer performed in line with the similarly equipped Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

			<paragraph>Thanks to Samsung's typical optimizations to the web browser it managed to grab a win from the Droid Turbo, which uses Google's mobile Chrome browser that typically doesn't benchmark as well.</paragraph>
