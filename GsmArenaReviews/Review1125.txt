			<paragraph>It's a big day for Nokia today - it just announced the new crop of Lumia phones, which are the first members of the family to run on the new Windows Phone 8 platform. The future of the Finnish giant is riding on the success of these new phones, so the whole tech industry is watching with bated breath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first device Nokia announced is the Lumia 920, "the most innovative smartphone in the world". As expected, the camera has Carl Zeiss lens and Nokia's PureView technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 920 is the new Nokia flagship and promises better images and better video than competitors. It has an 8MP sensor, unlike the 808, but the PureView tech enables better image stabilization and better low-light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Lumia 920 is an LCD with 768x1280 resolution. It's pixels update "up to 2.5x faster" than other LCD screens and is also the brightest screen on a smartphone. It is "super sensitive" too, Nokia demonstrated that it works even through thick winder gloves. The ClearBlack technology has been improved and is now PureMotion HD+ - it automatically adjusts the screen tone and brightness according to the ambient light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also packs features like wireless charging with the Fatboy pillow (which has Qi tech inside), NFC, Nokia City Lens augmented reality app and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second phone announced today is the Nokia Lumia 820. It's a more compact device than the 920 and uses a 4.3" ClearBlack AMOLED display with WVGA resolution. It's a polycarbonate unibody design too, but has protective shells that go on the back to add a new color to your phone or enable the same wireless charging you get on the 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is a 8MP shooter with Carl Zeiss lens, though it's not a PureView camera. It still gets some of the interesting new camera features that Microsoft just showed off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft had some new features of Windows Phone 8 to announce too, so it's not just new hardware that we saw today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page for the Nokia Lumia 920 hands-on. The Lumia 820 live photos, garnished with our first impressions are on page 3.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After the Nokia Lumia 920 was handled on stage by various Nokia and Microsoft employees, we finally got our turn at playing with the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 920 is not a small device, but for its 4.5" screen it's actually not bad - it's only marginally bigger than a Lumia 900. Still, at 185g it's one of the heaviest smartphones out there. The shell of the phone is a polycarbonate unibody that's 10.7mm thick and the back is curved, which really improves handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall design harkens back to the Nokia Lumia 800, though the polycarbonate is glossier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The horizontal camera placed near the center of the back is a nod towards the Lumia 800 too. The Lumia 920 camera is flush with the back, even though Nokia added the impressively souding optical image stabilization - a first for smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 has a PureView-branded camera, but misses on the 41MP sensor - it uses an 8.7MP sensor instead. Still it has the image stabilization and the super bright F/2.0 aperture plus Carl Zeiss lens, and according to Nokia those allow for unrivaled image quality in low-light conditions. The phone also comes with three Lens apps be preloaded - SmartShot, Cinemagraph and Panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"PureView" stands for innovative camera features, not a megapixel count (Nokia has been saying that right from the start, that's why the 808 PureView shoots 5MP images by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the plate surrounding the camera on the back as well as the keys on the side of the device are made of ceramic that Nokia tells us is nearly impossible to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the front of the Lumia 920, its IPS LCD screen features the same curved glass we saw on the Lumia 800 (Nokia calls it "2.5D") and uses some brand new technologies that Nokia refers to as PureMotion HD+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image on the screen appears as if painted right on the very surface of the screen - something we really appreciate. Even though it's not an AMOLED, the viewing angles are great and so are the colors. The new display tech automatically adjust the screen settings to fit the ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen glass is Gorilla glass and there's Synaptics touch tech. As we saw during the demonstration, the screen will detect touches even if you're wearing gloves but it's even better than that - you can use your fingernails (good for the ladies) or even use your car keys as an improvised stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 comes with two wireless technologies that Nokia thinks will be huge - NFC and wireless charging. NFC comes into play with the new Bluetooth speakers, but also for content sharing and NFC features from WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wireless charging, the 920 supports Qi technology, so it will work with any Qi-compatible charger. There were three chargers that Nokia showcased - a somewhat boring looking plastic charger, a soft Fatboy pillow charger and the JBL PowerUp Bluetooth wireless speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that the Nokia Lumia 920 doesn't have (and we wish it did) is a microSD card slot - you have to rely on the 32GB built-in storage (plus that 7GB SkyDrive storage). The design allows it (as we saw on the N9 and Lumia 800) and the OS supports it too (the new Lumia 820 has a microSD card slot), so we don't know why Nokia decided to do without it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is also not user-replaceable (a more understandable consequence of the unibody design), but there's a 2000mAh juice pack in there. Official numbers promise 17h of 2G talk time and 10h of 3G talking.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The second device introduced by Nokia is the smaller brother of the new Lumia flagship, the Lumia 820.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It features a 4.3" AMOLED display of WVGA resolution and, while the resolution is lower, the AMOLED part is actually a step up from the 920. Sadly the Lumia 820 misses on the PureMotion HD+ fun. Inside, there's the same 1.5 GHz dual-core Krait and 1 GB of RAM, but a smaller 1650 mAh battery, and 8 GB of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another advantage of the more affordable Nokia Lumia 820 over the Lumia 920 is the presence of a micro SD card slot, which supports cards up to 32 GB in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Windows Phone 8 interface isn't finalized yet, we can't go much in depth from that standpoint, but we will give you our impressions of the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall construction of the device does not feature a curved front glass display like the 920, but has a glossy paintjob which looks like it will attract fingerprints with regular use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA resolution makes the display really pale in comparison with the 920, but seeing as how they have the same internals, we expect the 820 to be zippier due to the lower amount of pixels it has to push.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction shows the same meticulous attention to detail characteristic of Nokia, and the device feels very solid in-hand.</paragraph>
