			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 928 for Verizon Wireless is the carrier's long awaited, exclusive Windows Phone 8 flagship. The LTE smartphone was part of the rumor mill for quite some time - the first reports of a high-end Nokia smartphone for the Big Red emerged right when the Lumia 920 landed exclusively on AT&amp;T late last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As its name mildly suggests, the Nokia Lumia 928 is not dramatically different from the Lumia 920 for AT&amp;T - mostly thanks to Microsoft's strict hardware restrictions for its mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, with a full xenon flash supplementing the 8MP OIS camera and the PureMotionHD+ AMOLED, the Nokia Lumia 928 for Verizon has enough bragging rights on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 is the first Windows Phone device to pack a xenon flash from the Finnish company, so, naturally, the expectations towards its low light imaging talents are as high as they get. Nokia's marketing campaign for the model is centered on its camera prowess too, so we expect the Lumia 928 to be truly special in the imaging department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of talents, which the Nokia Lumia 928 has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the silicon inside the Nokia Lumia 928 being a standard Windows Phone 8 affair, it is the camera and the new screen tech that command the bulk of the attention towards the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the 8MP snapper all but promises to be one of the most capable ones around, while the new 4.5" AMOLED display has helped the Lumia 928 shade a few grams in comparison to the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being slimmer than the Nokia Lumia 920 however, the Lumia 928 for Verizon is still far from pocket-friendly. Because of the large bezel around its display, the Lumia 928 has the footprint of today's crop of 5" Android smartphones. Add the thickness of 10.1mm thick, and you get a rather bulky handset, though we find this particular niggle forgivable, given the camera tech, packed into its polycarbonate body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance the Nokia Lumia 928 appears to be the best equipped Windows Phone 8 smartphone on offer at the moment. Read on to find out if the device will live up to the high expectations. As always, we'll kick the review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bright red box has the bare essentials<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 comes in a bright red, Verizon branded box. Inside it, you will find a charger, a USB cable, as well as the usual set of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A stereo headset would surely have been a welcome addition to the retail package of the Lumia 928. Sadly, the trend set by the US carriers is to omit headphones as a bundled accessory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 is the first one to break the string of high-end Nokia Lumia smartphones, which feature attractively rounded side edges. The Verizon offering features angular design with a number of sharp edges - it is hardly the best looking Nokia Lumia to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 is only available in a black or white color scheme - gone are the bright colors, which Lumia smartphones are known for. Regardless which color scheme you pick though, the smartphone's front will remain black. This makes the black version look really stealthy, while the white ones almost have dual-color setups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is, unsurprisingly, exceptional. The Nokia Lumia 928 body is made from a single piece of polycarbonate with gloss finish. The entire front of the handset is covered in Gorilla Glass 2, so the occasional beating and the daily wear and tear shouldn't be a problem for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Nokia Lumia 928 are 133 x 68.9 x 10.1 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 162 grams. While the considerable thickness of the handset is easy to forgive, considering the solid camera hardware, we couldn't help but notice that the Lumia 928 with its 4.5" display has the same footprint as a 5" Android flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.5" PureMotionHD+ AMOLED display of the Nokia Lumia 928 is a solid improvement over the IPS unit of the Lumia 920. The deep blacks and infinite contrast ratio of the AMOLED screen make a perfect companion to the Windows Phone 8 UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen features a PenTile matrix like most AMOLEDs we've encountered. The display's pixel density of 332ppi however, makes sure that you won't notice the matrix having fewer subpixels than an RGB unit does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the earpiece, the ambient light, and the proximity sensors reside. The front-facing camera and a set of Nokia and Verizon logos are also to be found above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is where the usual trio of capacitive buttons for controlling Windows Phone 8 can be found. The mouthpiece is there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding the mouthpiece and earpiece of the Lumia 928, we must point out that both are prone to collecting dust easily. Their functionality is not affected, but it is nevertheless irritating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing on the left side of the Nokia Lumia 928. The power/lock key, the volume rocker, and the dedicated camera button are all located on the right. They have the same finish as the Lumia's polycarbonate body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card tray, 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port, and the dedicated microphone for active noise cancelling are all located on top of the smartphone. There's nothing on the bottom of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia Lumia 928 is where the great-looking loudspeaker grille and the entire camera tech reside. The presence of the dual LED/Xenon flash and a dedicated microphone for noise cancelling during video recording speak plenty about the snapper's serious intentions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heavily touted loudspeaker performance of the Nokia Lumia 928 was very good, considering its non-stereo nature. Sound is loud and clear, though far from what the HTC One has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 sports the same 2,000mAh battery as the Lumia 920. The newcomer achieved an endurance rating of 41 in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Nokia Lumia 928 feels slightly awkward. The high-gloss polycarbonate is kinda slippery, so accidental drops are not unlikely. The tapered edges of the device, combined with the large bezel make holding it in one hand slightly uncomfortable, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we'd give the Nokia Lumia 928 high marks for its build quality. The design and ergonomics of the handset are far from perfect though. Nokia and Verizon have obviously tried really hard to differentiate the Lumia 928 from the rest of manufacturer's range. We are not sure however, that the end result is worthy of the high-end stature, which the Nokia Lumia 928 possesses.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is meant to look the same across all devices but makers still have a way to customize the experience and stand out against the competition. Nokia has more leeway than other makers thanks to its deal with Microsoft, but it also has the most riding on the platform - Nokia doesn't have Android to fall back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, WP8 on a Nokia Lumia is noticeably different from what you get from competing makers thanks to a number of exclusive features. We'll cover them one by one, but first here's a quick look at the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the primary interface looks mostly the same, there are a number of improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft added a lot of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to add notifications and images on the lockscreen. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps get to show more limited info ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - one of the installed apps can be set to choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account) or you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles - when you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind, the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller or resize tiles by dragging like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking - well, not true multitasking, but an iOS-like approach instead. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (navigation clients, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you start frantically hitting the back key it will start closing all of the open apps, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has expressed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice Actions, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, however you protect your phone, you can do nothing against accidental (or not) meetings with the floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info to help them with their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book up to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many friends and too many notifications waiting for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 offered loud and clear in-call sound and we had no issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker of the Nokia Lumia 928 did an adequate job - nothing to complain about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2012, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the Lumia 928 now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 audio output is pretty similar to those of the other Lumia smartphones we have tested. Its relatively clean and with average volume levels, which should be enough for most users, but may not be enough to please very demanding audiphiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 928 managed good scores with the higher than average intermodulation distortion the only exception. Volume levels are about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones isn't too bad. Consisting of a notable increase in stereo crosstalk stereo crosstalk, it's certainly not the worst we have seen. Loudness levels do drop a bit, but not more than on most competitors in that scenario, so it's an average score once again.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera with optical stabilization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 928 has a 26mm wide-angle lens by Carl Zeiss, a LED and a xenon flash combo and it's the third Lumia smartphone (after the 920 and 925) to feature true Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) instead of digital tricks that try (and fail most often than not) to achieve the same result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is a gyroscope detects the motion of the phone and the whole optical assembly moves in the opposite direction to cancel out the movement (e.g. hand shake. That happens 500 times a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 928 has that clever multi-aspect 8.7MP imager (1/3", µ 1.4 pixel size), which was first introduced back in the day with the Nokia N9. It snaps photos at 3264 x 2448 resolution in 4:3 mode and 3552 x 2000 in 16:9 mode (only 11% drop in resolution). Most other cameras simply discard the info from the 4:3 sensor to make it produce a 16:9 photo and lose 25% of the resolution. In the case of the Nokia Lumia 928 not only is the loss substantially lower, but also the 16:9 and 4:3 modes have a different viewing angle (with 16:9 being wider).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app. The Lumia 928 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes it a couple of seconds before a photo is taken. This is more delay than we're used to from modern phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses is an interesting feature, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens, the Panorama and Cinemagraph lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Shoot uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode). You can also pick the best face and cycle through each facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama does what it says - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph create photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated, it really brings them to life. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern. This was great since you can get back to the image after the fact and correct it if you didn't get it right the first time around (we did that to reduce camera shake visible in the background).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 photos come out with some nice, pleasantly saturated colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In high contrast scenes we noticed the Lumia 928 has a tendency to give priority to exposing correctly the shadows, rather than the highlights (quite the contrary to the Lumia 928, by the way). Depending on the uses, this may be either a positive or a negative thing. In our time spent with it, we liked this decision better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the wide F2.0 aperture, the Lumia 928 photos have an impressively shallow depth of field (for a phone!) You can get a blurred background easier than on competing devices, especially on closer shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of sharpness, there is two ways to look at it. When you look at your photos in a fit-to-screen mode, they look highly detailed, which is what we guess the manufacturer has intended and optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But when you zoom in to 100% and you examine the actual quality from up close, the Lumia 928 seems to have several disadvantages. First of all, the noise suppression routine takes its toll on the fine detail even in bright daylight, while, sadly, still leaving plenty of noise around. The subsequent sharpening somewhat counteracts the watercolor painting look, but also makes the available noise more apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the optical image stabilization is still a unique feature, which is enough to compensate for these downsides. Thanks to it and helped by the wide F2.0 aperture, the Lumia 928 is able to get away with really low handheld shutter speeds. These help it achieve correct exposure in low light unlike most competing smartphones, and even in the cases where the available light still allows other cameraphones to snap a correct exposure, the Lumia 928 does it at a lower ISO thus immediately scoring better with its low noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the xenon flash, it left us with mixed feelings. While our impromptu flash shootout with the Samsung Galaxy S4 and its LED flash showed us that the xenon flash on the Lumia 928 is indeed superior, it turned out it's not universally better. The thing is we are not that happy with the quality of the xenon flash implementation in the Lumia 928.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, in closer shots the xenon flash produced a brighter, much more evenly illuminated scene than a LED flash. But that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, the xenon flash on the Lumia 928 is still nowhere close to the performance of a point and shoot camera. Secondly, most often than not, the flash photos turned unpleasantly yellowish, obviously a case of bad white balance decision by the Lumia 928 camera. And finally, in good light there is no way you can force the xenon flash to fire, so its usefulness as a fill light in high contrast or backlit scenes is more or less absent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, without the OIS and xenon flash, the Lumia 928 camera is only averagely good. It's even better, if you if you are not the type to zoom in or crop out your photos. In good light most high-end 8MP smartphones are noticeably better. Come twilight though, and the Lumia 928 is able to outperform them all as you can rely on either the longer shutter speeds offered by the OIS or on the brighter, time-freezing illuminating properties of the xenon flash (if you are close enough to your subject).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 shoots 1080p and 720p videos (720p is the default mode). The OIS comes into play here if you're holding the phone in your hand (we doubt many people carry tripods around).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 videos turn out really nice. They are highly detailed, with nice colors and good sharpness. Digital noise is not an issue at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an untouched 1080p sample from the Lumia 928 you can download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, with video recording the benefits of the stabilization system are available all the time. Camera panning and general camera movement come out smooth. Thanks to the absence of camera shake the videos have a quality feel that you can rarely get from a cameraphone with a similar stabilization system. The latest iPhone 5 has a great digital stabilization but it still falls short when you are shooting while walking, something which the Lumia 928 excels at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 20Mbps the Lumia 928 videos have plenty of video bitrate. We, however, were surprised to see that the much touted high dynamic range three-mic setup on the phone produces videos with only mono sound (and it's got a bitrate of merely 96 Kbps).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, penta-band 3G with HSPA, and 4G LTE connectivity. Naturally, there's also support for Verizon's CDMA network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in range of an LTE network, the 928 will do up to 100Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 3.1. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 928 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 928 on top of it and will charge it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 brings got a major upgrade, but kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent. The Lumia 928 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing and the 332ppi pixel density keeps text sharp even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is working on the Xpress Browser for Windows Phone, which does the web page compression trick independently of carriers, but that isn't available for the Lumia 928 yet. We're slightly disappointed that Microsoft and Nokia promised stuff that we wanted to try out, only to find out it's not yet available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 928 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing offers more than just web results though - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is Local Scout, which lets you search for various points of interest around you. There's the camera scanner too, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The third one is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store (formerly Phone Marketplace) is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is well above 100,000 and, while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that most of the top apps are already available for its platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 won't work on the older versions but all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table and they are more powerful than the default Bing Maps that other Windows Phones come with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drive is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout app will locate nearby points of interest and it will even show you indoor maps of malls. The app has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone perpendicular to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 really is a memorable character. Thanks to its top-end spec sheet (by Windows Phone 8 standards), headed by the hugely capable camera with xenon flash, the handset outshines every competitor, which runs Microsoft's mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera's lowlight performance is expectedly impressive. Thanks to the optical image stabilization on board, the snapper can pull off impressively low shutter speeds and therefore great low-light photos without using a flash. The xenon flash itself on the other hand, adds further to the photography credentials of the Nokia Lumia 928 in dark places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The presence of an AMOLED display on board of the Lumia 928 is a welcome sight. It has helped the smartphone shave some weight, compared to the Lumia 920, while improving to UI experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is far from being the perfect WP8 offering though. We can't help but feel that the design and the ergonomics of the handset have been seriously overlooked, especially considering Nokia's track record in this particular field. The Nokia Lumia 928 neither looks, nor feels as desirable as the rest of the high-end Lumia range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the question of the device's internals. Camera unit aside, the Nokia Lumia 928 is no different than the Windows Phone 8 flagships which broke cover in September of 2012. With a fresh batch set to be released any moment now, the Lumia 928 is bound to soon feel even longer in the tooth than it does already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 928 is priced at $99.99 with a two-year commitment to Verizon, after a mail-in rebate. To sweeten the deal even further, Microsoft offers a $25 gift card for its app store to users who purchase the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are a Verizon customer, looking for top-end Windows Phone 8 hardware, or a mobile photographer who absolutely must have a xenon flash and decent smartphone functionality in one package, then the Nokia Lumia 928 is the device for you. Otherwise, here are some other options available at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If xenon flash does not sit high on your list of desired features, then the Nokia Lumia 925 is clearly a better choice than the Lumia 928. The Lumia 925 looks better by our not-so-modest opinion, and has superb ergonomics, while keeping the same functionality as the 928. The Nokia Lumia 925 will hit the shelves of T-Mobile US any moment now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 925</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 is also worth considering if you're not keen on having a xenon flash. It's heavier than the Lumia 928, but again, looks better no matter how subjective that might be. It is also more pleasant to hold. Finally, because it has been on sale for a while, the Nokia Lumia is available for less than the 928.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you want to break away from Nokia's hold of the Windows Phone 8 realm, you can consider the HTC Windows Phone 8X. A xenon flash it has not, but the Taiwanese offering is cheaper, lighter, and gorgeous looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Windows Phone 8X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, there are plenty of alternatives to the Nokia Lumia 928 out there. Curiously, the bulk of them are made by Nokia - a fact, which proves yet again that Microsoft Windows Phone is already all but synonymous with the products of the Finnish company. As a member of the aforementioned group, the Nokia Lumia 928 will further help the cause of its manufacturer, while also fulfilling the Big Red's need of a Windows Phone flagship.</paragraph>
