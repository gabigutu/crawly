			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no need for us to tell you how important the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is for both its own manufacturer and the Android world in general - our daily interest stats speak for themselves. Given the predecessor was really something special, what everyone wants to know now is whether or not the new Samsung flagship has what it takes to fill its boots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III seems to bring all the latest and greatest technology in the mobile world under one roof. The quad-core CPU and the HD screen are taking most of the credit here, but the S III has quite a lot more to offer, as you can see in the list below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lengthy list for sure and pretty impressive for the most part. In addition to plenty of extra screen estate, resolution and processing power, the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III brings a new, much larger battery, the futuristic eye-tracking technology, along with some other cool software tricks up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, of all the rumored goodies, the non-PenTile screen and the 12 megapixel camera are the only ones which didn't make the cut, but we are not sure you should feel too sorry about that. The subpixel density is still on par with what the S II offered, while the camera got a whole new sensor, so it might still turn out to be a nice upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just looking at the spec sheet should be enough to convince you that the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is a good phone. But good is certainly not enough when you are succeeding the most popular Android smartphone to date and competing with a beast of a phone in the HTC One X. The S III needs to be great, but we'll only know that for sure after some quality time with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page as we start exploring the hardware of the new Samsung top dog.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6 mm, the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is certainly not the most compact smartphone around, but you could hardly expect anything better with a 4.8" screen. In fact, Samsung engineers deserve credit for fitting such a massive display in what's basically a mere 4.5mm wider and just over a centimeter taller than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III isn't too heavy either - 133g sound more than acceptable given its size and, while it will certainly be felt in your pocket, it is by no means a burden.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is one of the most controversial aspects of the new Samsung flagship. Built entirely of glossy plastic, the Galaxy S III takes its cue from the Nexus lineup design, rather than the S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy finish is a questionable choice for lacking the high-end vibe that a smartphone of this caliber deserves. The good news is that the Samsung Hyperglaze coating partly makes up for that, improving both the feel and the handling of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hyperglaze basically means that there's another, see-through layer of plastic on top of the back panel - similar to what we saw on the Meizu MX. This layer helps mask some of the fingerprints and is actually decently grippy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we wouldn't call the Galaxy S III ugly. We do feel that claims about it looking no better than Samsung's entry-level phones are an exaggeration. However, we can't shake off the feeling either that the finish does the S III little justice. Some higher quality plastic a la Galaxy S II or even a polycarbonate unibody along the lines of HTC One X or Nokia N9 would have suited a flagship smartphone much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that even if the design is far from perfect, few people will actually be looking at it too closely. Who will waste time looking at the back of the I9300, when there is a screen as gorgeous as this up front?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.8" Super AMOLED of HD resolution is where the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III magic happens. The image quality is every bit as impressive as its specs suggest - tack sharp and with perfectly deep blacks, it's probably the best you can find on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors are nicely saturated by default, but the display settings menu offers a choice between four different modes, so you can opt for more natural colors as well. We did prefer the livelier dynamic and standard modes, but the natural and movie modes will probably have their fans too. What's important here is that the S III display offers you flexibility that no other screen on the market can give you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is splendid too - the HD Super AMOLED isn't the brightest around, but its reflectivity is so low that even when outside in the brightest day, you'll still be able to make out what's on the screen quite clearly. The viewing angles are wide too - there's some color loss when you reach the extremes, but the icons and text remain almost perfectly clear, giving that printed look that we love so much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III did in our dedicated display test. You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you get the same three keys as on the international version of the Galaxy S II - capacitive Menu and Back buttons and a regular press Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual extra functionality upon a long press is enabled - the Menu key handles Google search on the device, while the Home key brings up the task switcher. And if you click the home key twice the voice control kicks in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as ambient light and proximity sensors. There's also a 2 megapixel front-facing camera for video-calls and a status LED up there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III features the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, all there is on the right is the power key. Once again Samsung is releasing its flagship droid without a dedicated camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S III hosts the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with MHL, enabling HD TV-out connectivity. You'll have to purchase an adapter to use that extra functionality, though. The other thing of interest here is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is where the 8 megapixel FullHD-capable camera lens is located. It's flanked by an LED flash and the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the paper thin battery cover reveals the microSIM slot, the solid 2100 mAh battery and the microSD card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III runs on the latest Android available at the moment - 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, which has been heavily modified by the latest TouchWiz UI from Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we delve into the details, check out a short video demo of the new interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface bears a strong resemblance to an ICS-running Galaxy S II (no surprise here), though Samsung did update the lockscreen to make it fit better with the nature-inspired design of their latest flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen no longer draws a circle around your finger, so you don't have a visual cue about how far you need to swipe to unlock the phone. There are ripples as you drag your finger accompanied by water-drop sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable a news ticker at the bottom of the lockscreen, which is a great way to stay up to date on current events. You can also expand the tickerto view all news items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not done with the lockscreen - there are four shortcuts at the bottom that can be used to quickly jump to an app. Since there is no circle to drag them into, you just swipe them up. You can, of course, customize which shortcuts reside here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more trick - you wake the phone (tap the power button or the home key), then press and hold the screen and rotate the phone horizontally. It will unlock and start the camera as soon as it's in the right orientation to snap a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the screen seized the opportunity to accommodate another shortcut - the bigger screen now fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the bottom of the screen, you'll notice that there aren't any on-screen control keys - Samsung decided to stick with their traditional hardware Home button flanked by capacitive Menu and Back buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area shows the same number of toggles as before - five - but one of them has been replaced. You get Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation and Power saving (which replaced the Bluetooth toggle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's quite deliberate - Ice Cream Sandwich comes with Android Beam, which uses NFC for sending files, bookmarks and links, and the Galaxy S III builds on that functionality with S Beam - it does the NFC handshake, but switches to Wi-Fi Direct to speed transfers up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there are five more toggles just off screen. You can scroll them sideways to reveal more functions - Notifications (toggles icons in the top row of the screen), Mobile data, Bluetooth, Driving mode and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the dock at the bottom fits five icons, the homescreen and the app drawer fit only four on a row. However, there are now five rows in the drawer so you still get more shortcuts per page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following the ICS convention, the app drawer has a tab that lets you pull out widgets to the homescreen easily. This wasn't available on the ICS-running S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's an ICS-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a button at the bottom of the list to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager as we saw on the updated Galaxy S II, but now there's an extra button, which lets you clear the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back to the homescreen and the widgets. Ice Cream Sandwich comes with various widgets and Samsung have added more still. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is now available natively in ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - add, delete (but you can't have more than seven) or just rearrange them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi is a simple single-threaded benchmark, so we know what we can expect from it. The Galaxy S III falls behind the HTC One S and its brand new Krait cores, but it gets pretty much the same result as the HTC One X and its four Cortex-A9's even though those are clocked 100MHz higher than the Galaxy S's.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack offers multithreaded benchmarking, making it essential for testing quad-core beasts. The Samsung Galaxy S III managed to outpace all phones but the HTC One S. It even beat the One X even though it should have been a bit slower (again, 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1.4GHz for the Galaxy S III vs. 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1.5GHz for the One X).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benchmark had some issues with Ice Cream Sandwich, so what we're seeing here might be due to Samsung's software getting along with Linpack better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant is a composite benchmark (it tests CPU, GPU and I/O). The Galaxy S III easily got the top score here, with a comfortable lead over the HTC One S and One X in terms of general performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III relies on a Mali-400MP GPU, though the exact details (number of cores, clock speed, etc.) are still to be revealed. It has a 720p screen to fill with pixels (up from WVGA on the S II), so we were curious to find out how it fares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 shows much better performance compared to the NVIDIA GPU inside the Tegra 3 chipset that the HTC One X uses and it even beats the new Adreno 225 inside the One S (it's important to note that the One S has a qHD screen). The Galaxy S III shows the best 3D performance on a droid yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that older Samsung models used to have a 60fps framerate ceiling set in the software and we're not sure yet if the Galaxy S III is running into such a limit, artificially lowering its score (NenaMark reports the results in FPS).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark is available on iOS devices too, so it can give us some idea of how the Galaxy S III compares to the PowerVR SGX 543 GPUs. We're using the Egypt test in offscreen 720p mode so that results are directly comparable even though each device has a different physical screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mali-400MP inside the Galaxy S III beats both the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, which use SGX 543MP2 (at different clock speeds). The SGX 543MP4 inside the new iPad comes out on top though, but it does have a huge battery to back it up and even with a new manufacturing process, it might need to have its clock speed reduced when (if?) it's put inside a mobile phone (like the GPU inside the iPhone 4S is compared to the one inside the iPad 2).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark Egypt (offscreen 720p)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is a JavaScript benchmark and as such isn't strongly affected by the number of CPU cores - it mostly reflects the raw performance of a single core and how optimized the JavaScript engine itself is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung seems to have done quite well here as the speed increase goes further than the 16% or so CPU frequency advantage that the Galaxy S III has over its predecessor. The S III is the fastest phone we've tested, beating other ICS phones and even the HTC One S and its Krait CPUs (which use a newer architecture than the Cortex-A9 cores in the S III).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark adds HTML to the equation - behind the scenes JavaScript computation won't do much if the web page can't update fast and smooth. The Galaxy S III tops this chart as well, and quite comfortably at that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 MP snapper is improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III offers the same camera resolution but actually improves on the performance. It can capture stills of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels and 1.9 MP ones with the front-facing cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Galaxy offers geotagging, touch focus, face and smile detection and digital image stabilization. Due to the fast quad-core processor it is also able to simultaneously record HD (1080p and 720p) video and take near full-resolution pictures (those are cropped to an aspect ratio of 16:9 to match that of the videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is quite similar to what the Galaxy S II has. You get two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder - on the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any five shortcuts to put there - you can easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III's sensor has an F/2.6 aperture as opposed to the F/2.65 of its predecessor and focal length of 3.7 mm compared to the 3.97 mm of the Galaxy S II. This results in slightly wider viewing angles on the Galaxy S III, so you'll be able to fit more in your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a quick comparison between the two below. The Galaxy S III indeed offers slightly higher resolution, but it also tends to go a bit too far with the color saturation. The images are certainly looking punchier now, but also a little less realistic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range of the images produced by the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is pretty pleasing too and, despite the high saturation, noise is kept well under control. We'll need to do some more pixel-peeping before we can tell if the Galaxy S III is the best 8 megapixel camera out there, but it's certainly in the running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung were bragging left and right about the zero shutter lag of the Galaxy S III and we are happy to report that the smartphone is able to deliver. Pictures are snapped extremely fast and there's even a burst mode available where you hold the virtual on-screen shutter and the phone will make 20 consecutive shots in just 6 seconds or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing is that the images, produced in burst mode are in full 8 MP resolution. We were told that the S III is actually capable of capturing full res shots at 3.3fps for much longer than that, but the 20 shot limit was set to prevent users from filling their storage with hundreds of identical shots.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording is top notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III is able to record FullHD 1080p and HD 720p video hassle-free. During recording you can also snap full-res 16:9 stills if need arises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left for up to five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos themselves are impressively smooth and with plenty of detail. The Galaxy S II did great in terms of video capture but the S III seems to do even better, resolving even more detail and offering better color rendering. The video container used is mp4 and it creates clips with a bitrate of about 17Mbps with stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the 720p videos. We can't help but think that Samsung could've put some of that extra processing power to good use and implement slow motion recording at 60 fps or something of the sort. The average bitrate of the 720p videos is 12Mpbs and they too come with stereo sound. In case you were wondering, you can also record 720p video using the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched 1080p@30fps video clip and 720p@30fps video clip from the Galaxy s III for you to download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S III features and extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're about to take a quick look at some of the more important new features debuting on the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III is the second smartphone in the Galaxy series to do voice commands. While the Vlingo-powered service on the S II only worked if you kept to a strict syntax, here Samsung have implemented a more direct competitor to the iPhone's Siri. You can tell the S Voice to accept/reject calls, take pictures, set alarms and search the internet among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our experience this worked pretty well, recognizing most of the commands we threw at it. When you're not going too far with your demands, the S Voice tends to understands what you're trying to do quite well, even if the response time is, at times, a bit long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct call</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This allows you to place calls by lifting the phone up to your ear when you're browsing your contacts, or are in the middle of reading/writing a message to someone and decide you need to call them. This is a nifty little feature that can save time (not to mention how cool it actually is), and works without a hitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart stay</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever been reading something for a while when the screen annoyingly dims or even shuts off right in the middle of your sentence? Samsung have implemented a sensor which detects whether you're looking at the screen, so you no longer have to worry about keeping it awake. Works just as advertised, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart alert</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've been away from your phone for a while, the Galaxy S III will vibrate on pickup, if you have any missed calls or messages. Also fairly straightforward in terms of how well it works, with the vibration being subtle, but long enough to make sure you don't miss it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Beam</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. Sadly, you'd need two Samsung I9300 units to make this work as there are no other S Beam-enabled smartphones on the market just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam. We tested this with the Galaxy Nexus and we had no trouble transferring webpages and contacts from our S III to the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Buddy photo share</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Buddy photo feature enables the Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III to automatically tag your pictures with all the people it recognizes from your contact profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is the Galaxy's version of a windowed media player. It lets you play a video in a separate window, which you can drag around and resize while performing other tasks on the phone, such as texting or web surfing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were quite pleasantly surprised at how well this worked. Not a single moment of lag or stutter while the video played in its own window, and the interaction between video and background was quite seamless. Granted, this isn't going to be used that often, but it's a nifty feature to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gesture controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III also has some new gesture controls you may not have heard about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar pan and tilt gestures from the S II are also here. Here's a video we made showing some of the new gestures in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III is a powerful smartphone that will give even the most discerning users no reason to regret their decision. We are yet to see if it will manage to replicate the Galaxy S II success, becoming one of the most influential smartphones on the market, but it certainly has the potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III does have the luxury of coming later to the market after its main rivals - smartphones like the iPhone 4S and HTC One X - and Samsung made it count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Koreans made a complete package out of the S III, leaving almost nothing to the competition to claim exclusivity on. The Samsung engineers made sure to teach their new flagship plenty of cool new tricks (we really love Direct call and Smart Stay), which should give it an edge in the head-to-head battles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet probably the most impressive thing Samsung achieved is cramming the huge 4.8" HD screen into a body not much bigger than that of the Galaxy S II. It's also thin and feels very durable (we know how much torture the S II could survive and that one had its display protected by the previous-gen Gorilla Glass).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hyperglazed plastic will not be universally loved, but that might not turn out to be too big a problem - all eyes will be on the screen anyway. It's huge and sharp, it's got beautiful colors and deep blacks: in short, it's the best display we've seen recently. As expected, the whole PenTile thing didn't prove to be a big issue. You'd need a real close look - and perfect eyesight - to even begin to notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software of the Galaxy S III brings a good deal of improvements, though they feel mostly evolutionary with only a few major breaks from what we already saw on the S II after it got ICS. And there are no two ways about it - the Galaxy S III is amazingly fast, occasionally beating its opponents by quite a wide margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera seems pretty good too, but we'll need more time to do proper testing. In fact, we'll need more time to properly test a whole lot of other stuff too - so we hope we whetted your appetite with this preview, but we're far from done with the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
