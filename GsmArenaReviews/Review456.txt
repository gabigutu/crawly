			<paragraph>The new Nokia N90 mobile phone prides on a two megapixel camera equipped with Carl Zeiss optics. Besides, it has a wide array of camera controls and picture settings. Is the new Nokia N90 the best photo mobile? This article includes a direct comparison between pictures taken with Nokia N90 and pictures taken with the excellent Canon G6 digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Official photos of Nokia N90 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just days ago you had the chance to read our review of the Nokia N90. Can we still speak about this model as of a mobile phone? It is a multifunctional device, which serves not only as a phone, but also as a communicator, a MP3 player, a digital camera and a video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointment did not last much<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When I was writing the review about Nokia N90, I got seriously disappointed by its built-in camera. Everything just spoke in its favor: the optics with Carl Zeiss hallmark, the sensor with two megapixels, incl. previous experience with the 6630 and 6681 camera models. We all expected Nokia N90 to be one of the best photo mobiles ever. So imagine how great my disappointment was when I found out that auto-focusing takes three long seconds, pictures are often blurred and finally, text shots can be considered nothing else but a plain shame. To be honest, at first I tended to think that the fault was rather mine for all pictures advertised in Nokia N90 official presentation look brilliant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, things found their places. By mistake, Nokia had provided us with a phone, whose camera was not the final one. So we were immediately given a new phone, whose tests left no doubts and made all editors in our office claim in one voice: "This camera is really good!". That is why we decided to prepare a separate review of the camera of N90, in which we offer you a lot more sample photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N90 displays all its beauty </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How should I hold this?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N90 has a special construction - it features a rotating display and camera. It offers two hold positions for taking pictures - one is in the same style as if you are holding a video camera, the other one is the classic photographic camera position. In the first case, the main high-quality display plays the role of a viewfinder. It shows 262K colors in a resolution of the incredible 352 × 416 pixels. The device is controlled by the joystick, mounted on the right side of the phone. The joystick itself is manipulated by user's right thumb. The shutter button is situated just above the joystick. Moreover, you can even press the rotating camera downwards by using your thumb. To use the menu, use your left hand and press the two buttons placed next to the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Holding the phone to take a picture </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer to take pictures in the same way as with a common compact camera, you will need to close the phone. You need to turn the camera part crosswise; the small outer display serves as a viewfinder. It is active, displays 65K and offers a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. The entire control process is done by the joystick on the top edge of the phone. Right next to the joystick is the shutter button. Unlike standard photo cameras, here the control is managed from the opposite side with one's left thumb. This is a bit unusual, but needs just a while to get used to. The inconvenience of this handhold is that the rotating part of the camera needs to be turned by the lower end - its mechanism does not allow a full rotation of 360°; if you try to rotate it along the top, the camera part gets stuck into the stop, which results in the camera lens looking upwards without a possibility for further rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera control application starts automatically once one of the described positions has been set. Besides, you won't even find an option that allows manual activation of the camera, because it is simply unnecessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The camera of Nokia N90 is mounted in the rotating interlink of the phone. </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Always prepared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though the standard camera handhold does not offer a perfectly comfortable viewfinder, the photographic process is much faster. A single turn of the camera part is enough for the camera to start running. When you turn back the camera part to its original position, he camera keeps on being active for about 3 seconds and then turns off automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder is dominated by a focusing white square. The state icons are shown on the upper margin of the display. They provide details on the currently activated scenic mode, the number of pictures the free memory space allows for, or the charge level of the accumulator. In the bottom end of the display you will see the flash setting indicator, the digital zoom indicator as well as an icon that reminds you that a press on the joystick will take you into the main menu. To start focusing, just press the shutter release button about half its way down. In a moment or so the focusing square will turn green, which is a signal for you to press full the release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera's viewfinder ? when you switch options quickly with the joystick the active flash setting gets shortly viewed in the from of a text legend (the relevant icon never disappears) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capture of a certain scene, including the focusing process, takes approximately two seconds. The average time we measured was 2.14 sec. If you are fast enough and manage to give an immediate confirmation, you may succeed to take another picture in two more second, or if we have to be punctual, in 2.33 sec. From a stand-by mode a picture could be taken in less than three seconds. Beside the time for focusing and saving the picture into the memory you need to also take in account the time necessary for the camera part to turn and for the relevant application to get started. After a short training we managed to achieve an average time of 2.61 sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Just like with a real camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you hold the phone in a camera mode, the camera application is activated by the joystick placed on the top side of the phone only. By moving it forwards and backwards you roll in the menu, viewing this way the options for activating the diode flash - automatic, constantly on, off, red eye reduction. By moving it to the right the scanned scene gets zoomed in, by moving the joystick to the left it gets zoomed out. Instead of this, I would have rather preferred exposure compensation for the zoom is digital only, so not really usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The joystick that serves the camera control is situated on the right side of the phone, right next to the release button </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press on the joystick takes you into the menu. By moving it forwards/backwards you navigate the menu. A move to the right or to the left is used for selecting a choice, which is then confirmed by another press on the joystick. The first option in the menu is the one that allows you to choose the right scenic mode - automatic, macro, night mode, sport, portrait, landscape mode and user mode. The automatic mode works very well. In this aspect, the sport mode is quite practical for it "forces" a shorter exposure time on the camera. In all other cases the mode setting is done automatically according to the conditions defined by the relevant scene - incl. the macro mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera's main menu ? mode selection </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the second place in the menu is the flip over option. The picture appears on the display upside down. This mode is quite good for making self portraits. More from the menu: the self-timer delay, which has values of 2 and 10 seconds. The option for setting the exposure compensation is offered on the forth place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  When you make portraits you need to turn the view upside down ? setting the exposure compensation </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture size options are the last to come. There are three possible resolution modes to choose from (2 MP - 1600 × 1200 pixels, 0.5 MP - 800 × 600 pixels, 0.3 MP - 640 × 480 pixels). You can also choose, whether pictures should be saved into the phone or on the memory card. Also available is the option for a short view of the picture just after it has been taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Setting the self-release function ? more setting options </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You will need both your hands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you hold the phone in the way typical for standard cameras, the number of curious glances around you will surely multiply. In this position the phone looks rather futuristic; its ergonomics are excellent. Use your right hand to hold the phone firmly and your thumb to control both the joystick and the shutter release button. The latter two buttons are easy to manipulate. The joystick sometimes slides away when fingers are sweaty. You will hardly ever use your left hand here. Perhaps, only when you want to view ready pictures or set a certain function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Context keys above the display (next to the display, when you take pictures) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder is brilliant; it really can compete with any viewfinder of a digital camera. In the left margin of the bottom line there is a legend of the relevant function of the context key that lies next to the display. Beside this, here you will find information about the number of pictures still possible to take as well as details on the state of the accumulator. In the top line there is a legend of the second context key. At the opposite end of the line information on which mode is currently activated is provided- the static picture scan or the video mode. The state icons appear in the column in the right margin of the display. In its right bottom corner, out of the mentioned column, there is an icon indicating the resolution that is being used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera's viewfinder ? when the zoom gets activated a scale appears in the right column </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting, a white square appears in the middle of the display. When you focus, it does not turn green. The focusing process is indicated by a blinking icon in the column on the right. Blinking stops when the focusing is over. If it changes from green to grey, it means focusing has not been successful. Unfortunately, during the focusing process the exposure parameters are not blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the flash and the zoom functions are controlled by the joystick as well. A press on the joystick opens the photographic functions menu - inside the menu you will find various scenic modes as well as flash and exposure settings. These functions include the same setting options like in the horizontal handhold mode. Two more options have been added though - white color balance and color effects. In the first case you can choose out of four types of light (sunny, cloudy, bulb light, luminescent light), or leave on the automatic mode. In the other one you are offered sepia, black &amp; white or inverse picture scan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera's main menu ? photo settings o mode selection </paragraph>
			<paragraph>What I don not like about the exposure compensation is that the view-through it offers at the scene that is just being scanned is much too small. I would rather have the setting controlled by joystick as well as a full viewfinder, but apparently, I am not lucky... I would have also appreciated an option that would let me leave the menu by moving the joystick to the left. Not having it, however, I am forced to use my left hand to press the upper context button next to the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Photo settings - so bad that the view-through at the picture is so small </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Taking photos is not the end of the game<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The bottom context key opens camera's main menu. The switch to video mode option is the first to appear. Further on, you can view all pictures in the gallery, go to the settings of the camera functions as well as activate the sequence shooting option. In this mode it is possible to record a series of as much as 6 pictures in a full resolution. The main menu also contains a reference to the self-timer option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Picture gallery ? view at a selected picture ? beside other options, pictures can also be sent </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The setting menu allows you to make a resolution or memory setting. You can also set the camera to display the picture after it has been taken or save it into the album. The album is nothing but a file in the picture gallery. Of course, you are free to create as many albums as you like. They will help you put all your pictures in the desirable order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Filing a picture into the album ? album list ? viewing the album (the view is identical to the one in the gallery, in this particular album there is only one picture) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only can you place pictures into albums. The camera allows you to carry on far more daring things. Nokia N90 offers an easy-to-use picture editor, which is really good if you consider the fact that it is basically a mobile phone we are talking about. Selected picture can be cropped, resampled or turned upside down. You can give it a frame, decorated it with an animated picture (clip-art) or with text. A nice surprise is the option for setting the font size, color and incline angle. To your wish you can also modify the brightness and the contrast in the pictures as well as apply color effects or the so called Comics effect, which turns the photo into a drawing. Well, I have kept the best of it all for the end, and here it comes...If you remain disappointed by the flash option for red eyes reduction, the editor offers you another option to eliminate the red eye effect. The editor comes especially handy when you send MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Function menu of the picture editor ? graphics selection ? selecting font color </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Picture modification with better graphics and text ? applying Comics effect ? applying inverse color filter</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When the pictures start moving<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You will surely agree that this camera would have not been a modern one if it was not equipped to shoot video. Nokia N90 shoots videos in MP4 format in a resolution of 352 × 288 pixels. The length of the video record depends on the size of the memory available. A lower resolution or the 3GP format that allows the pictures to be sent in a MMS is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewfinder in video mode ? video setting options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder in the video mode is the same like the one in the camera mode. Logically, the info about the number of the remaining pictures gets replaced by details about the remaining time. In the down right corner an icon of the video resolution and format is displayed. In the upper left corner you will see a sign saying that you have activated the video mode. Zoom can be used during the shooting process too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Video camera's main menu ? mode selection ? video options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu has been somewhat reduced. When you shoot a video, you can choose between two scenic modes - a normal and a night one. Further on, you can balance the white color as well as apply color effects. From the main menu you can enter the gallery or go to the video settings, where you can choose a format, turn off the sound recoding or select memory in order to save your record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have made several sample records, whose quality was surprisingly high. Recording was good and the final video was completely fluent. Well, you can find this out yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now stop these endless explanations and present you the next two chapters, in which I am offering you a big amount of sample photos in full resolution as well as comparable photos taken with a classic camera - Canon G6.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All sample photos are presented in a full resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels; the files sizes are about 300-500 KB. EXIF information is also available. For those, who do not want to download such big data packs, I have prepared a smaller format in a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels too. They are easy to recognize for their previews on the page are also smaller. What you need to do is decide, whether you like to view the full resolution picture or rather the reduced one and then click on the bigger or the smaller picture on the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To have you appreciate the camera of Nokia N90, I added comparable pictures, taken with Canon G6 (of course in 2MP resolution captured by the camera's 7 MP sensor), to some of the pictures taken with N90. I took the same photos both with Canon G6 and Nokia N90. I used the auto exposure as a working mode for Canon G6.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>City tour<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One can hardly rebuke something in the following photos. One of the weak places of Nokia N90 is the red color, as best shown by the comparison between the picture of the red car taken with N90 and the same picture taken with Canon. You can also notice the limited dynamic range (overexposed clouds) of Nokia N90, because of the much smaller sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        </paragraph>
			<paragraph>        </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A walk in the park<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Note the visible barrel distortion in the picture of the information board. Anyway, you can see a similar result from the wide end of almost every digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The purple fringing (or chromatic aberrations) in the following pictures, where the trees meet the sky, is significant. In fact, in this high contrast scene neither N90, nor Canon managed to successfully set the right exposure degree. For this reason we used a negative exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The following photos present well the different ways, in which the two cameras see various colors. Canon's pictures reflect reality more precisely. Nokia, however, did not do badly at all, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two types of digital zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is equipped with a digital zoom of two modes. At the beginning of the zoom-in process, missing pixels get gradually added. If you continue to zoom in the picture, however, at a certain moment it gets cut out and gets displayed in a smaller format (central picture). Then pixels keep on being added till another cutout is done. In the end, you get a 20 times zoom and a VGA picture of very poor quality (the very right one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Macro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the picture with flowers, Nokia focuses on the center of the scanned scene, while Canon chose to focus on the closest flower. The rest of the pictures show that N90 is very good at taking pictures from a closer distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Color effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the creative photographers...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exposure compensation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though we already wrote about the exposure compensation several times, I would like to mention it here once again, with the help of the following pictures. The first photo was taken in automatic mode, in the second one I took off a grade, and in the third photo two grades were taken off. As visible, the sky is no more that bright and at the same time, the trees are reasonably dark - just like they should be. In the last picture I made the contrary step - I added a degree, just for the comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Test patterns and text<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although the test pattern shows a significant degree of softness, lines are clear enough. As for the text shots, Nokia took them really well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>White color balance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The following pictures were taken under bulb light. In the first one, the white balance is automatic; in the second one we used the bulb light mode of the white balance; in the third picture the sunny day mode was applied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash in action<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The diode flash proved to be quite efficient. The first picture below was taken without a flash and as you can see, it is really dark. The second picture was taken from a distance of about 1 meter and on the third the distance between the little bear and the mobile camera is about 2 meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Carl Zeiss did not fail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the description of the camera of Nokia N90 in my review of the phone I put a certain dose of careful criticism (perhaps, you remember the paragraph entitled as "Did Carl Zeiss fail?"). As if I knew, that something was wrong. But as you can see today, Nokia N90 belongs to the absolute top 10 chart of all photo mobiles. At present, N90's only and most dangerous competitor is Sony Ericsson K750/W800. Which one is better? The answer will be here soon...</paragraph>
