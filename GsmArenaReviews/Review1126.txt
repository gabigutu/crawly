			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the touchscreen revolution swept the mobile world, rugged smartphones became much harder to come by. They are making a slow return now though, with Sony Mobile being one of the key players in that market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tradition of producing attractive rugged droids dates back to the the days of Sony Ericsson, and it's great that it continues now, when Sony is in full control of the company. More impressively, the company shows that it's not going to limit element-resistant smartphones to the mid-range anymore, and so we come to the subject of today's review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S may not make the Samsung Galaxy S III shake with fear, but its specs sheet seems good enough to provide a high-end smartphone experience and that should be all that matters, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in length between the two lists above alone points to the fact that the Sony Xperia acro S is worth a second look. Water resistance might be the headline feature, but it's certainly not everything this Sony smartphone has going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It builds on the Xperia P platform, but addresses the issues of limited storage and uninspiring battery backup and employs a far superior 720p screen, which seems like a pretty good recipe for success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, the waistline grew, which is hardly a desirable side-effect these days, but if the performance is all there, we doubt many will mind. Also, we are hoping the S3 chipset, which is now looking more like mid-range material, doesn't have too damaging an effect on the great package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's waste no more time guessing and get down to the actual testing - the hardware inspection starts right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The retail box features a dock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Sony Xperia acro S is slightly different from what we had for our preview. Inside is a rather large GreenHeart charger, which pairs with the microUSB cable to charge the phone. An in-ear headset is also available, with two extra sets of earbuds in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll also find a dock, which you can use for placing the Xperia acro S on your desk or night stand. It's nicely build but offers little in terms of functionality - there are no HDMI ports, 3.5mm jacks or battery charging compartments on it - just a microUSB plug that can only be used to charge the device. Nonetheless, a stand is a nice accessory, but one that few people would actually pay extra for, so it's good that Sony included it in the package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia acro S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S measures 126 x 66 x 11.9 mm and weighs 147g. That's rather thick and heavy for a phone with a 4.3" screen, but at least it has that IP certification and reasonably large battery to show for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's easy to recognize that the acro S is a member of the Sony Xperia family. It may lack the transparent stripe, characteristic to the NXT lineup, but its design is the familiar combination of right angles and curves. There's also the SONY logo styled with the company's instantly recognizable font to give away the smartphone's allegiance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like how the Sony Xperia acro S looks - the absent transparent element has cost it some character, but has given it a more serious look, which many will certainly appreciate. The high quality build materials also help the aesthetics, but we have to deduct a few points for the rather thick waistline. With a 4.3" screen the nearly 12mm thickness might not be a deal-breaker in terms of usability, but it hurts the high-end feel a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen of the smartphone you get the earpiece, flanked by the front-facing camera lens and the proximity sensor. An ambient light sensor is also available to take care of automatic brightness adjustment here, while a LED light glows red or green depending on charge status and blinks whenever there's something that requires your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, there are three the three capacitive keys (Back, Home and Menu) typical of the Xperia lineup. Just like on the Xperia S, the capacitive keys are big enough, but they've been tweaked to require a proper press rather than a light touch, which benefits usability once you get used hitting them with a little more force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three wired ports - microUSB, 3.5mm and microHDMI - are on the top of the phone. They are all hidden under plastic flaps to keep dust and water away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Xperia acro S holds a trio of controls - the power key, the volume rocker, and the dedicated shutter key. Sadly both the power key and the camera button are on the thinner end of the side, which makes them a bit hard to use. We still prefer an imperfect shutter key to no key at all, so Sony is actually doing a bit better than the competition here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker isn't that great either - its move is rather short and the feedback isn't good, so it will take some getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Sony Xperia acro S we find the microSD and the SIM card slots. Once again, there are protective covers over them, but this time they tend to cause some issues. While the microSD cards are relatively easy to operate for people with smaller hands, the push-to-pop mechanism might be hard to access by anyone with larger fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM slot is even worse - you need to use you nail to drag out the tray where you insert the card. And that's hardly comfortable for anyone but ladies with long nails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is pretty boring compared to the rest of the phone. It features only a lanyard eyelet which is accessible through a removable bottom portion of the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Xperia acro S features one of the stars of the show - the 12MP camera lens. It's located in a busy area in the top half of the smartphone - the loudspeaker grille, LED flash, and NFC chip are right next to and so is the secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of soft matte plastic, which feels good and hides fingerprints well. Behind it sits a 1910 mAh battery, which is rated at up to 290h of stand-by on 2G networks (310h on 3G) or 6h and 40 mins of talk time (7h 10 min on 3G). Those are all decent numbers, but the battery isn't user-accessible, so carrying a spare battery isn't an option and neither is replacing your unit when it starts to get worn out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, September 11: We put the Xperia acro S through our battery test and found it to be average. It can last just over 36 hours on a single charge. If you decide to drain the battery with calls only, it will take you a bit over 7 hours (on a 3G network). Doing the same with web browsing takes 5 hours 15 minutes or you can watch 5 hours and 40 minutes of video. You can learn more about our testing procedure over here and the full battery test write-up over here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Sony Xperia acro S promises great things and it delivers - it's mesmerizingly sharp, with punchy colors and very good contrast. It's backed by the BRAVIA engine which, as we've seen before, does very well on screens with high pixel-density - and the Xperia acro S display is one of the most pixel-dense at 342ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside (and it's not a minor one) is the sub-par viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility on the Xperia acro S screen is good, if unspectacular, as shown by the readings in our dedicated test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also put the Xperia acro S screen under our microscope and unsurprisingly we found it to pack the finest pixels we have seen to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The display under a microscope</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The curved back fits nicely in hand and the Sony Xperia acro S is generally easy to handle. As we already mentioned, it would have been perfect had it been a bit slimmer, but it's not too bad as it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will immediately notice a difference if you use the acro S after, say, the 8.5mm Galaxy S II, which has a screen of the same diagonal (and slightly larger size due to aspect difference), but the Sony smartphone is not hard to operate by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is our tour of the software interface on the Sony Xperia acro S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xperia on Ice Cream Sandwich<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of box and it's got the custom Sony launcher on top of it, so the interface doesn't feel too different. It's not exactly identical to what you got with the Xperias that started with Gingerbread and were promoted to ICS, but you will still find your way around reasonably quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we're starting with a short video of the user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S has the usual five-pane homescreen configuration, but there is no option to add or remove panes. Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of folders - they show thumbnails of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with older Sony smartphones, you can change the color theme of the launcher according to your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All active widgets gather there for easy viewing and selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, but the Album gallery is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When on a homescreen pressing the menu button opens up a context menu under the status bar. It gives you two options - choosing a widget and choosing a wallpaper/theme. It's oddly placed and easy to miss at first because the animation is so underplayed it looks as if nothing has happened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new addition to the lockscreen, missing from the Xperia phones of old, is the Walkman widget which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving and removing widgets hasn't changed and is as simple as on droids of old - hold a finger over a desired widget and move it around. The action has a cool wobble animation to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for, with no custom touches to them. For some reason, the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen as it usually is on ICS (and on other ICS-running Xperia phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a part of the ICS platform you get the Data usage app. Sony provided one on Gingerbread as well, but this one is far more accurate in calculating your used traffic. It also lets you set a limit for mobile data usage for a specific period and o gives you a breakdown of which apps have used how many of your precious bytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; reset feature for Android ICS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, restoring them with the previous saved settings. The reset menu also lies in the same submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has made a lot of improvements to the standard ICS build, but also omitted some that other OEMs are opting for. For example, Samsung has a Remove all feature when you open the task switcher. Also, there are still no connectivity toggles in the notification area and there's no option to change the number homescreen panes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8260 Snapdragon chipset, which packs two 1.5 GHz Scorpion cores, 1 GB of RAM and an Adreno 220 GPU, which has all of 1280 x 720 pixels to push. Altogether a nice configuration but still a year or so behind what the current crop of top droids have on tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We begin with the Quadrant benchmark where the Xperia acro S did its best but against mostly quad-core competition. It naturally failed to secure a top spot for itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BenchmarkPi the Sony Xperia acro S managed to beat the Xperia ion but not much else. Even the Xperia U and Galaxy S Advance came out ahead of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack tests the calculative performance of the two Scorpion cores inside the Xperia acro S. It won a midrange spot for itself, as expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 tests the GPU performance in a graphical stress test. The Xperia acro S got a solid 36.9 frames per second here, which is a stellar result when compared to other dual-core devices with fewer pixels to push out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider and BrowserMark test the web browsing performance. The acro S performed very well against the dual-core competition, Kraits aside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When all is said and done, the Xperia acro S is a balanced performer, and there aren't any major hiccups or slowdowns. It won't be winning many awards with its benchmark results, that's a given, but as a daily driver the acro S does just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S phonebook is pretty different than what we've seen so far. It has slight visual changes: the bottom bar no longer shows you shortcuts to phone, favorites, contacts, and is now a search and add number field. The contacts, phone, favorites and groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be alternated by side-swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia acro S was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S phone app features smart dialing. It searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. There's voice dialing too (the quickest way to activate it is to press and hold the hardware Search key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia acro S automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia acro S. Scoring a Below Average result, even with xLOUD turned on, the Xperia acro S is a definite disappointment. This could be due to its IP57 certification, which may have prompted Sony to muffle the loudspeaker under additional protection. More info on our loudspeaker test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is business as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layouts. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that as well. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia acro S offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It works the same as Swype. Even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The brand new gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S comes with the new Sony Ice Cream Sandwich gallery, called Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a whole new interface where images are arranged into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can also opt to show all of your albums in one place. There are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab - you can use pinch gestures to make the thumbnails bigger or smaller. Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all pictures with a Geo-tag are shown on a map of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab uses pictures from the connected online services - Google Picasa, Facebook, etc. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did with the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images in both galleries can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is new too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In keeping with the new music player and gallery, Sony has added a new video player as well. It's dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DivX and XviD videos are also working on the Sony Xperia acro S. The support isn't the best we've seen, but if you we had pretty good success with the 720p samples we threw at it and even some 1080p videos ran well. Sure, we have seen better, but if you keep the resolution to a reasonable level, it should suffice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, you can always download a video player off the Google Play Store with support for more video codecs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To complete the trio of redesigned Sony apps is the new Walkman music player. It retains all the functionality of the older music players but adds a little bit extra here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is divided into Playing and My music panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by type - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook buddies' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Walkman player offers support for customizable equalizer settings, giving die-hard audiophiles the chance to fiddle around with the individual EQ bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the rest of the music player is the same as what we saw on the neo V, this one adds music controls to the lockscreen. Swiping them either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support - an improvement over the Neo L, which had no FM Radio at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>12 MP camera knows a few tricks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S boasts a 12 megapixel camera with a back-illuminated Exmor R sensor and a single LED flash. It's capable of producing stills of 4000 x 3000 resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia acro S are identical to those of the Xperia S - they are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up two pages of extra settings - scenes, resolution, smile detection, geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode among others. You can customize three of the shortcuts on the left (the shooting mode shortcut is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five capture modes to choose from: Normal, Scene recognition, Sweep Panorama, Sweep Multi Angle and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia S take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Sweep Panorama is business as usual - you press the shutter key and pan the phone across the scene. The resulting panoramic photo can be viewed in both 2D and 3D (on a compatible TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sweep Multi Angle is much more impressive - you take a photo in the exact same way, but the result is very different. It produces something like a lenticular card, providing a different perspective when viewed at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone lets you look at the object from different sides. A shot of a moving object looks like an animated GIF or creates interesting and sometimes comical distortions.Photos taken in Sweep Multi Angle mode are handled by a separate app called 3D album, and not listed in the regular gallery. And just to make it clear again - the Xperia acro S doesn't have a 3D screen, but rather cleverly relies on its sensors to detect the handset movement and it changes the on-screen image accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S features a Quick launch option, which lets you customize the phone's behavior upon a press of the camera key when the phone is locked. The default option is Launch and capture - it unlocks the phone, starts the camera and instantly snaps a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to frame the first shot right from this mode, but you can quickly take another photo as the camera reloads quite fast. The other option is to just unlock the phone and start the camera, or you can disable the feature altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our field test, the 12 megapixel shooter on the Xperia acro S has a serious claim to be among the top Android cameraphones currently out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images turn out pretty good with good balance between contrast and dynamic range, nice color reproduction and fast focusing. Noise levels are generally good but raises its ugly head in the shadow areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S handles shooting on the macro level with ease, getting close to the best in its class. There isn't a macro mode on the acro S so focusing up close is done automatically. Check out the results below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the camera on the Xperia acro S shows a tendency towards regaining the past legacy of Sony Ericsson as a good cameraphone maker.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Okay video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S captures 1080p and 720p videos at 30 fps, currently the upper limit of what you can expect from a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera, including focus mode, metering, exposure value, image stabilization and so on. The layout of the shortcuts can be customized here, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S camcorder features continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeatedly attempting to lock focus and ruining your video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>FullHD videos are stored in MP4 format (20Mbps bitrate) and the frame rate nails the 29fps mark. The Xperia acro S videos come with stereo sound recorded at 131Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling - all pointing to slightly superior video recording compared to the Xperia S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While numbers show a potential for high quality the actual result isn't all that impressive. The Xperia acro S produces smooth videos with good colors but the level of detail isn't anything special. Videos look good on the Xperia acro S's HD screen but on a larger monitor things take a turn for the worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample captured with the Xperia acro S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are a slightly different story. Audio bitrate and sample rate are the same while the video bitrate falls to 12Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download 1080p and 720p samples taken straight off the device.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 3.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and connecting to your PC and there's also USB On-the-go support so you can attach external flash drives to the acro S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia acro S but you can get it through the Google Play Store. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Remote app is also available for free so that other Android smartphones can use it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia acro S also comes with Sony's LiveWare manager, which can be set to launch an app each time you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ICS browser rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest advantages that the Sony Xperia acro S gets from running Android ICS out of the box is the updated web browser. This browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart: when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is the ability to open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available as a Google Labs extra) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. These really go a long way in improving the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes in a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adobe Flash Player app has been omitted from the Google Play store so if you don't side-load it from somewhere the acro S will only be able to handle HTML 5 videos out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also opt for the much-improved Google Chrome web browser. It's very smooth and doesn't crash nearly as much as when it was in beta mode. The interface is pretty simple - you get a combined URL and search bar on the top. To the right of it there's a tab switcher button with the number of open tabs on it. Hitting the menu button reveals options like new tab, bookmarks, look at closed tabs on other devices, request desktop site, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between tabs is very intuitive. You just swipe to the left or right to move between various open pages. In the tab interface you can also swipe away tabs you don't want anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome offers full synchronization with your Google account. Just type it in and it will immediately connect to all of your devices with Chrome installed. The only thing that doesn't get synced are your passwords.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S doesn't come with many organizational apps preinstalled. There's no office document viewer, for instance, although you can get one from the Google Play store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia acro S. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver app helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, but you can't edit them on the phone as they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and you can expand it to include advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to a gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store is full of free apps that will cater to all your organizing needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache New York City and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android ICS, the Xperia acro S has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantee you won't have trouble with space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia acro S review course is complete and it's now time to check out its scorecard and see if it's worth your hard-earned cash. To be honest, it's not easiest thing to call, as the worth of the Xperia acro S is very much dependent on how important water-resistance is to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are the outdoorsy type who likes to take your smartphone to the beach but don't want to worry about it getting water-damage or filled with sand, than the acro S should definitely be on your shortlist. There's no better smartphone with an IP57 certification out there and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even if you could live without the extra protection against the elements, the Sony Xperia acro S is not to be written off too easily. It offers decent performance, a splendid 720p screen and an excellent 12 megapixel shooter, which turn the elemental resistance into an extra. You can think of it as an insurance against evenings ruined by damaged circuits. After all, as smartphones become an ever-increasing part of our lives, any accident that befalls them gets harder to live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if you are the careful type, you will probably find better value for your money elsewhere. It's not that the acro S fails in any aspect of its performance as a smartphone, but it doesn't exactly excel either - while some of its price point peers do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first name that comes to mind is naturally Sony's own Xperia S. The former Sony flagship packs basically the same specs sheet as it water-loving cousin, but costs less, has a slightly better design with that transparent stripe and a slimmer waistline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the handset that really makes the Sony Xperia acro S pale in comparison is the LG Optimus 4X HD. For the same &#x20ac;399 price tag, the LG flagship (until the Optimus G comes out) will throw in two extra cores, a slimmer waistline and a larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 4X HD P880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The super-slim metal-clad HTC One S also costs about the same as the acro S, but puts two Krait cores and an AMOLED screen into the mix. It is missing on the HD fun, though, so sharpness maniacs should probably avoid that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, if the IPX7 certification is a must for you (and if you are reading this review, chances are it is), you only have one alternative that can match the smartphone experience of the acro S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic Eluga DL1 has a far more compact shell then the Xperia, but having handled it a few times (though we couldn't keep it for long enough to make a review) we have to admit we were rather disappointed by both the handling and the software package. Maybe things will change once Panasonic issues the ICS update, but until then we'd pick the Sony Xperia acro S over the DL1 any day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Panasonic Eluga DL1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, the Sony Xperia acro S is a very solid smartphone. It didn't manage to beat non-water-resistant smartphones at their own game (which is too much to ask of any such smartphone, realistically speaking), but it does the task it was created to do quite splendidly. Here's hoping that Sony will take good care of it and issue an Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update in a timely manner.</paragraph>
