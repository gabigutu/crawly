		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s not a Black Label phone but could?ve honored the designer series. It?s called Black but bathes in light. What is the LG Optimus Black? To begin with, it?s solid build and pure elegance. With Android on board, smartphone meets fashion phone in a super slim package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Black is the first phone we?ve tested that uses the NOVA display technology. Special enough to warrant a dedicated article. You?re welcome to read the whole piece but, to sum things up, it?s the brightest display on a phone with picture quality that stands up next to the industry?s best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the 4? NOVA display however, the Optimus Black is a compact device ? there?s not much bezel around the screen and it's mere 9.2 mm slim. The smooth back with sloping edges makes the Black feel thinner still. And that?s 9.2 mm at the thickest ? no camera bump or any other bulging bits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen and the slim silhouette are certainly the highlights of the LG Optimus black but not all there is to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black focuses on the all-round experience rather than the raw processing power but a 1GHz (single-core) CPU and 512MB RAM should be by any means enough for most apps .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Black features the Wi-Fi Direct technology, which claims faster local file transfers than Bluetooth 2.x, and is as easy to set up as Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The imaging department also earns a nod ? 5MP stills and 720p videos should be enough for the average user. The 2MP front-facing camera is right on time to join the revival of video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, go and put your shades on ? we start inspecting the hardware of the LG Optimus Black, including the super-bright NOVA display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One-off packaging for reviewers, not mortals<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We gasped when we saw the box that the LG Optimus Black came in ? it was huge. Most phones come in boxes barely wider and taller than the device itself, but not the Black ? it came in a massive box that made it feel special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An email from LG was quick to solve the mystery of the box ? it?s for reviewers only and not the actual thing phones will be shipped in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the contents should be fairly representative of what the (probably smaller) retail box will hold. That?s a compact charger, a microUSB cable (to use with the charger too), a 2GB microSD card (with an SD adapter) and a single-piece headset. Be warned though that LG?s website hasn?t confirmed that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know what you?re thinking. They?ve just been treated to an excess of promo items so we?d better take the review with a pinch of salt. Worry not people ? the pencil looks pretty cheap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus Black 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG Optimus Black spans 122 x 64mm, which is compact for a 4? screen. At just 9.2 mm of thickness and 109 grams of weight, the Black will slip into almost any pocket problem free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG NOVA display gets due attention<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve already covered the LG Optimus Black display at length in the dedicated display article but we?ll recap the key findings here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NOVA display is the brightest we?ve tested and the brightest on a mobile phone in general. Our measurements confirmed the 700 nits of brightness that LG claim, in fact we measured it at almost 750 nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is excellent too, though that?s mostly due to the bright whites ? the blacks are not particularly deep. The table follows with our brightness/contrast readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering and sunlight legibility are very good as is the screen sharpness. The whites are spot on ? there?s no tint to them that can be seen on other displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are not perfect though ? good enough in real use though we?ve seen better. There?s a noticeable lack of contrast at an angle though not much color loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a macro shot of the displays of the Optimus Black, 2X, Samsung Galaxy S and S II and the iPhone 4. You can judge the perceivable sharpness of these displays by looking at their matrices from really close.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The styling of the LG Optimus Black is not exactly breathtaking but the execution is flawless. The minimalist look is in no way a disadvantage ? LG have ended up with a recognizable design out of nothing much really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewed head on, the Black very much resembles the Optimus 2X though the earpiece is very understated. Below it is the traditional set of proximity and ambient light sensors along with a 2MP front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we see the four keys below the LG Optimus Black display. The usual Menu, Home, Back and Search controls all use the capacitive touch technology. The keys are haptic-enabled (when pressed the phone vibrates lightly) but feedback goes a step further. Upon a press, the backlighting of the key you touched changes color for a second. It?s a feature we quite like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, some of the keys have extra functionality upon a long press. The Home key launches the task switcher, while a press-and-hold of the Search key triggers voice search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the left side of the LG Optimus Black, we find the volume rocker and the dedicated gesture button. They barely protrude from the phone?s side but are reasonably easy to locate by touch and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is completely devoid of controls ? it looks like we won?t be seeing much of hardware shutter keys in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Topside, there?s the 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port and the Power/Lock key. The microUSB port is protected by a sliding plastic lid and doubles as the charger port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is tiny but prominent enough though accidental presses are pretty much out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the LG Optimus Black holds nothing of interest beside the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 MP camera lens is located at the back, right next to the (not quite capable) LED flash. On the up side, the LED flash is good enough as a video light. The downside is there?s not much to protect the camera lens from scratches and smudges ? except that it?s slightly recessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the battery cover open reveals the 1500 mAh battery, the SIM and microSD card slots. The microSD card slot is hot-swappable even though it?s not accessible from the outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is placed on the sloping edge of the back but it still gets slightly muffled when you place the Optimus Black on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the 1500mAh battery, LG didn?t quote standby and call times. They are quick to brag about their NOVA display using 50% less energy than a typical LCD (and 50% less than AMOLED when displaying pure white). Maybe they?re waiting for the phone to launch officially before revealing the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black feels great in the hand. Despite the lightweight super thin body, the device feels extra solid. The curved back improves handling and the matt plastic is both pleasant to the touch and fingerprint-resistant. The Black is surprisingly light for a phone of its size ? some prefer heavier phones for the feel but others would go for less weight in the pocket. Anyway, we wouldn?t say no to the rock solid build and subtle elegance of the Optimus Black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We held in our hands the Optimus Black, the XPERIA Arc and the Galaxy S II in turn and the Optimus Black was perceptibly the smallest, though it has the smallest screen too. The other two are marginally thinner than the LG Optimus Black (though you likely won?t notice if you don?t have the them in front of you). As for build quality, the Black stands up to the competition very well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>More polish on LG Home<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s Android 2.2.2 Froyo with plenty of personal touches to it. The LG Optimus Black P970 has the LG Home custom launcher and the Gesture UI we already saw in the Optimus 2x.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI customizations are well done and visually appealing. The phone is fun to handle. You can see the user interface in action in the following video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom main menu has three different layouts to choose from. You can either opt for grid view with side scrollable pages or for a vertically scrollable list complete with an alphabet scroll. The last option is Category view. The default categories are Applications and Downloads but you can add new ones as needed. You can collapse/expand categories with a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen, which are visible across the homescreen panes and in the main menu. They?re Phone, Contacts, Messaging and a Home/Menu button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a view mode similar to the HTC Sense leap view: you can zoom out with a pinch gesture to see all the available homescreen panes in one place. It now has the added option to set a default screen (canvas in the LG lingo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of homescreen panes can be anything from 1 to 7. The way you place stuff on the homescreen has a twist too. Upon a tap and hold on the display ? or by hitting the add button in the menu ? gridlines appear on the screen and the four docked icons get replaced by a taskbar with widgets, shortcuts, folders and wallpapers to choose from. Thanks to the Gesture UI, once you?ve selected an item to add you can select the homescreen to place it on by simply tilting the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and automatic rotation. There are also music player controls available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gestures are a noteworthy feature of the LG Optimus Black P970. The Gesture UI covers traditional things like turn-to-mute and turn-to-snooze but it?s the extra functionality that?s more exciting. You can have panning in the gallery, browser and camera, pick up and end calls, control the media players, etc. There?s even an option to launch the camera straight from the lock screen with a shake. There?s some pretty cool stuff but you can also disable gestures altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We benchmarked the LG Optimus Black and it seems it?s more of a looker than a thinker. It packs a 1GHz single-core CPU and 512MB RAM but the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc and the Google Nexus S mostly outperformed it (in both CPU and GPU tasks), despite having very similar specs. Perhaps we?re seeing the difference between Froyo and Gingerbread here ? the Optimus Black still lives in v2.2 land.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays all the contacts in a list ordered alphabetically and there is an alphabet scroll on the right. There?s also a regular search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed ? First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phone book from getting overcrowded ? you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is displayed with a contact photo and name ? a tap on the photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use those to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single contact uses a tabbed interface. The first tab is Info ? and it shows all available info for the contact with handy one-tap shortcuts for calling, messaging and so on. The next tab is History, which shows the communication history with the contact (calls, SNS updates, everything).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab is Photos which show the contacts online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can link contacts (?join? in the Optimus Black?s terminology) so that if you have a contact added to multiple services, all the data from them is pooled in one place. When you tap Join, the phonebook will suggest a contact based on name and it?s right most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manually pick another one if it?s wrong of course. When you add a new account, the phone will offer to import all, only some of the contacts or only those it already has in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It?s a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus One Black showed good signal reception even in areas of poor coverage. The in-call quality though is good but rather quiet even at the loudest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call. A little iPhone-esque if you ask us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Optimus Black. Scoring a Very Good result, you can bet you won't be missing any calls with it. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts. If you do add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy. Too bad there?s no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which feature both portrait and landscape typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard looks a little iPhone-like but its good nonetheless. Portrait mode is accurate enough (though we would get a typo on occasion) for text input and the landscape mode makes things even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing text you can also use the tap gestures ? a tap on the side of the phone will push the text cursor in the opposite direction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old 3D image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It also boasts cool 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the gestures button to flip through photos and zoom-in on a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view. In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Optimus Black?s multi-touch support but you can also use double tap or even the +/- virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Email apps or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming and panning is fast and smooth and there?s absolutely no lag in doing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player covered in style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music looks familiar but it has seen some polish. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its side reveals a cool 3D wall of all the albums you have in your music collection. Tap on an album and you?ll see a list of all songs from it. There?s an alphabet scroll at the bottom of the screen to make finding albums faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip a song or go back to the previous one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a menu to search ? for the title, the artist or the album title. After that you can pick where to search ? your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also when you?re playing a song it gets displayed in the notification area. You can also pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is mediocre at best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the LG Optimus Black P970 failed to impress in our audio quality test. The handset did well below the norm even when connected to an active external amplifier - it has its extreme bass frequencies cut-off, the noise levels, stereo crosstalk and dynamic range are mediocre and the distortion levels are average at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it comes as any consolation to you, things get only marginlly worse when you plug in a pair of headphones - the stereo crosstalk takes a hit and the distortion levels increase, but only very slightly. This doesn't suffice for a good overall mark. Plus the Optimus Black is one of the quiestes handsets we have seen, so you will understand why we aren't too excited about its performance here.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cool FM Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you get tired of your music collection, there?s an FM radio with RDS in the LG Optimus Black. It can play over the headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple but powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface ? it?s just a list of all the videos on the devices. There?s an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that?s about it. You can of course play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either ? there?s the scrubber to skip to some part of the video along with the play/pause button and next and previous buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more buttons are available on the screen ? one toggles cropping (i.e. fit video to screen, or crop it to fill the entire screen) and the other activates the Virtual surround.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black handled just about every video file we threw at it ? the usual 3GP and MP4 stuff along with WMV and AVIs using DivX and XviD. 1080p videos are a no go, due to the single-core processor. Still 720p videos work just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles worked fine too, with settings for font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there?s no option to manually point to a subtitles file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some issues that need to be addressed though ? only English subtitles worked, any non-Latin characters would cause the subtitles to fail (even Spanish subtitles). Using UTF didn?t help.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus Black comes with a 5 megapixel shooter, capable of capturing 2592 x 1944 resolution images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the user interface to be quite convenient, though many of the important settings are inside the extended settings menu, so they take a while to toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also the whole camera experience would have been much more convenient if there was a camera button onboard, but that has obviously been sacrificed in favor of a slimmer profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features are limited to geo-tagging and touch focus along with ISO setting and preset scenes and effects. There?s panorama shot and ?out-focusing shot?, which artificially blurs anything away from the chosen point of focus. There?s beauty and art shot too, which do automatic post-processing to the photo. Digital image stabilization is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Optimus Black camera is certainly not among the best in the 5MP league. Photos generally lack detail and contrast and could use some sharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the noise levels are surprisingly low and overall the Optimus Black image quality is just about equal or even better than Samsung Galaxy S still camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the pics from the LG Optimus Black are just about equal or even slightly better (in terns of noise) than those by the Samsung Galaxy S. The Apple iPhone 4 is a stride ahead of the two even though it traditionally exhibits plenty of luminance noise.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Black is among the smartphones, capable of capturing HD 720p videos. FullHD videos are an obvious no-go as there just isn?t enough processing power to back them up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder UI is basically unchanged from the camera one. In terms of options you can choose the resolution of the video, white balance, color effects, video quality and duration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Optimus Black manage to disappoint us with video recording. Despite the fact it's running a final stock firmware version (V10a, if you need to know), all of its clips came out with messed up aspect ratio once you download them off the phone. Here's a sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also make sure you check out this full untouched video sample taken straight from the camera. You need to manually force your video player to the correct aspect ratio of 16:9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only good things we can say about these videos is that they sem to have fluid framerate and some natural colors so once LG fix that, the Optimus Black camcorder should be considered as good alright. We sure hope it's some sort of a pre-release bug that won't make its way to retail units.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like with the still camera, the LG Optimus Black is much on par with the Galaxy S in video recording too, though we gotta admit the Galaxy S has an edge here in the amount of resolved detail. The margin gets even bigger in the low light scene where the Optimus Black smears the fine detail, underexposes the whole shot and still manages to show up more color noise than the Galaxy S. But that's nitpicking, we guess in day to day situations, you could call these two tie.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black comes with a big range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and three-band HSDPA with 7.2 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload speeds (hypothetical ones). There?s also Wi-Fi b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lacking features include Bluetooth 3.0 (there?s version 2.1 with A2DP support) and an HDMI port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app, that lets you control a DLNA network ? you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone on another device (e.g. DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi Direct leading the way to file-sharing revolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct standard is still to roll on a mass scale but we finally see it on smartphones such as the second generation Galaxy S and the Optimus Black. It?s a technology which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty in it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready in order for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the inevitable Bluetooth demise. This is something we?ve seen before with the replacement of the infrared technology for the Bluetooth one and now it seems bound to happen with Wi-Fi Direct becoming widespread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Wi-Fi Direct-certified device was the acclaimed Galaxy S I9000, last year. But in order to use this technology the phone must have the appropriate software for it and so far it?s not been provided for either Wi-Fi Direct device. LG showcased such a technology at CES 2011, using an app called Wi-Fi Cast, which is sadly missing from our unit. We dug the Android Market in hopes to find a replacement app but we without luck. So until such an app surfaces or manufacturers provide their phones with the required software, we can only wait for the true Wi-Fi Direct coming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still we connected our LG Optimus Black with the Samsung Galaxy S II through Wi-Fi Direct and there were no speed bumps in the road. The time it took to connect the two devices wasn?t more than the time to do the same, using Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hope to see developments on using this technology in the near future, as it doesn?t seem all that improbable for it to become mainstream during the course of this year. Maybe a software update or a tweak will do the trick but for now we?ll have to wait.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flashy web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device ? put it on a beautiful screen, like the Black?s and it provides flawless experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalistic (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and +/- zoom buttons. The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls auto-hide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is still very powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Black supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There?s text reflow too ? it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you?ve zoomed in using pinch zoom, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole browsing experience is excellent ? there?s almost no lagging and the 4? WVGA screen offers plenty of room even for complex web pages. Text remains crisp regardless of zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Black browser is Flash-enabled and everything ran very smoothly ? from desktop YouTube (and other video sharing sites) to touch-oriented Flash games. Still don?t expect to run a 720p video on a webpage and pan around the page with no lag. The single-core CPU inside the Optimus Black maxes out in those cases.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has it all covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there?s a preloaded document viewer and editor (well sort of).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it?s one of the most feature advanced mobile editors we?ve seen. You can of course view documents ? Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing offers almost a full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested, even better than the Windows Phone 7 one (which had many editing limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black features great SNS integration. Both Facebook and Twitter contacts can be added to the phonebook and you can link those to existing phone contacts ? in fact, the first time you create an account, the phone will offer to import the contacts from that social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s clever too ? you can import all contacts, manually select which ones to import, or just those who match people in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you link a contact with their Facebook or Twitter, their status updates will go into the History tab of their contact info and the Photo tab will show their online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app lets you read news feeds, post messages on people?s walls, browse their profiles and so on. You can of course post status updates and including a photo is very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter app is also feature complete. You can manage your profile and the list of people you follow, plus read tweets from others. The @me section will help you find tweets directed at you more easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you receive a new message, it will appear in the notification area just like regular SMS messages do. You can set it to notify you when there?s a new @me message or direct message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a dedicated MySpace app as well, in case you?re using that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps getting better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black is running on Android 2.2 Froyo and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to just about every app in the Android Market (there are some that require Gingerbread, but they are still a small percentage of the 200,000+ apps available at the official app repository).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG?s App Advisor comes preinstalled as with other Android smartphones by the company. It offers a list of recommended apps, nothing fancier than that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps moves from Utility to Entertainment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got an accurate GPS lock very quickly. If you need only general location (within 100-150 meters) for location-based services, you can use Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network positioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Maps 5.0 is part of the standard Android package. It uses vector maps, which are smaller and download faster but also support cool 3D views. You can use the two finger camera tilt and camera rotate gestures to look around (though 3D building are not available everywhere).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Maps Navigation option is available too ? but only for supported countries. The new version features offline rerouting. That is, it will cache the needed maps to navigate you to where you?re going and even if you deviate from your course, it will be able to calculate a new route even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street View mode is supported and will do the well-known compass trick, which is like taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black is not the brightest bulb in the LG Android portfolio. Fair enough, it has no problem with authority. It claims to have the brightest screen on a phone to date, and that?s a good enough selling point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nova display is among the best LCD screens on the market. The performance aspects aside, the technology favors extra slim phones and that?s a great advantage for the Optimus Black. It?s a real looker of a phone and impressively well-built too. For solid smartphone feel and subtle but classy look, they don?t get much better than the LG Optimus Black P970.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Feature-wise, it?s nothing spectacular but we knew all the way the Optimus Black wasn?t getting the premium flagship treatment. It?s the same package that Samsung offered a year ago with the original Galaxy S. Users won?t be disappointed though. There?s solid connectivity, complete with Wi-Fi direct and hotspot capability. 5 megapixel stills and 720p video are good enough, a 2 MP front-facing camera with video-call support a welcome addition too. The LG Home launcher is at times better than TouchWiz. Our main gripe is the OS version ? the Optimus Black will have to wait for Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG are having quite a franchise out of the Optimus ? spreading across Android and Windows Phone 7 ecosystems. The Black makes itself comfortable in the upper midrange but safely away from the dual-core hustle and bustle. It?s not exactly the season?s high-end smartphone but Android fans would be wrong to ignore it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the potential rivals, the Optimus Black will have to look at its own family first. The Optimus 2X is just too powerful to ignore. As befits a flagship, it outperforms the Optimus Black on all accounts but it will set you back a hefty sum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II looks like the smartphone to beat currently ? and the Optimus Black?s well out of depth here. The original Galaxy S is a viable alternative though. It will be SuperAMOLED against Nova Display, and the latest Android tipping the scales slightly in Samsung?s favor in an otherwise pretty tight game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC will be looking to upset the Optimus Black with the the Desire S and the Incredible S. It?s a very similar spec sheet and comparable performance. The things to note are Gingerbread on the Desire and the 8 megapixel still camera on the Incredible S. Oh, and there?s Sense UI too . And we gotta say, the Incredible S has one of the best screen HTC has come up with lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire S ? HTC Incredible S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have the XPERIA Arc and the Neo to challenge the Optimus Black. The Arc has the massive Reality Display to show off. Both handsets run the latest Android Gingerbread and have solid imaging credentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would be unfair to compare the Optimus Black to the new generation dual core phones. But it?s not a phone to write off either. It gives LG a boost in confidence and that?s more than welcome, considering the highly competitive bracket it falls in. Both HTC and Sony Ericsson have recently updated their droid lineups, and Samsung are busy churning out Galaxy S spinoffs. The Optimus Black has a key feature to market itself on and looks classy without overdoing it.</paragraph>
