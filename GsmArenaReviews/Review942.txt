		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A bit odd actually that no one thought of it so far. We mean, the ultras come by the dozens, and so do the pluses, ones, plays and, obviously, droids. The question is though, do we need to be wary of anything called Vogue and coming from China.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, the MediaPad 7 Vogue isn't front-page stuff obviously - not the cover of the namesake magazine anyway which, apropos, has had a Chinese edition for nearly ten years now. But that's not the point, far from it. It's a tablet signed by Huawei, whose devices have been consistently delivering good bang for your buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Huawei have been raising its own bar slowly but determinedly, the MediaPad 7 Vogue isn't actually an upgrade. The 7" tablet lineup is being built top to bottom obviously. The original MediaPad, which we quite liked more than a year and a half ago, was followed by a trimmed down MediaPad 7 Lite. In 2013, the MediaPad 7 Vogue joins the ranks alongside the MediaPad 7 Youth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All those sequels are focusing on affordability - the screen resolution is down from WXGA (800 x 1280) to WSVGA (600 x 1024). On the other hand they're a tad more compact and lighter than the original, and powered by quad-core chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue has to offer and what didn't make the cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the second generation of seven-inch MediaPads, but building on the predecessor in every way possible wasn't an option for Huawei. To get some breathing space in such a busy market, the MediaPad 7 Vogue had to strike a fine balance between its level of equipment and affordability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two generations of the Nexus 7 are tough competition even for reputable manufacturers like Samsung and Acer, but Huawei might as well have found a way to make their offerings relevant. It may look like they threw in the towel by settling for the lowest tablet resolution, but the MediaPad 7 Vogue isn't entirely clueless about what users want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full telephony capabilities, a side-mounted microSD card slot and solid battery life sound like the right things to put forward. Good thing the Vogue has kept the unibody design of the original MediaPad - who would say no to the good looks and solid build, entry level tablet or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the build and finish are next on the menu, followed by the user interface and features. Shall we?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The styling of the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue closely follows the template set by its predecessor. There's not a single removable bit on the body of the MediaPad 7 Vogue, as opposed to the original Huawei MediaPad but, technically, it's not a unibody this time around - you can clearly see how layers of different material and finish are pieced together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build is rock-solid still, and what makes it even more impressive is that the Vogue has shed near 60g of weight. The side-mounted slot, accommodating both the SIM and a memory card, is a great convenience. The pattern at the back repeats the original - a two plastic patches etching into a slab of aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original MediaPad came with multiple color options, while the MediaPad 7 Vogue is available in just two, black and white. At the end of the day though, the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue has managed to keep the styling that set the original apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the MediaPad 7 Vogue is rather generic. It's designed as any other slate out there with reasonably thick bezels allowing for comfortable one hand operation without touching the screen with your palm. As Huawei runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, software keys replace traditional hardware buttons leaving the front quite neat and neutral.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 193.8 x 121.3 x 9.5mm, the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue is quite comfortable to hold with one hand. The compact size means you can easily carry the tablet in a coat or jacket pocket. At 335 grams it's also among the lighter 7" tablets out there too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the very top of the MediaPad 7 Vogue you'll spot the earpiece grille - the tablet supports voice calls over the cellular network and Huawei obviously thought users won't mind using the tablet as a phone. A headset does seem the more sensible option though. Below the earpiece, there's the VGA front-facing camera, as well as the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing below the screen but the Huawei logo, as all of the controls are on-screen buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the MediaPad 7 Vogue is free of any buttons and ports. All of them are located on the right: the Power/Lock key and volume rocker near the top and the combined microSD / SIM card slots in the bottom corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's when referring to the tablet in portrait mode obviously, but with the interface freely rotatable (including the lockscreen) choosing the most comfortable orientation is up to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the tablet is clean and smooth, the microUSB port and 3.5mm headphone jack placed at the bottom. The microphone pinhole is squeezed in between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.15MP camera lens is at the back. Just below the protective glass, there's a tiny nub that protects it from directly contacting with the surface it's resting on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grille is right below the lens, the Huawei logo dead center on the aluminum plate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue has a 7" IPS LCD display with a resolution of only 1024 x 600 pixels, which is the lowest that makes sense on a tablet - WVGA seven-inchers are stretching it really. Pixel density is mediocre at 170ppi but something you can live with - of course there are devices that will gladly double that, like the new Nexus 7 at 1920 x 1200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has inadequate viewing angles, with quick loss of contrast and colors getting washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness control in the notification area is a four-step virtual key: Automatic, 100%, 50% and 0% brightness. There's no brightness slider as in competing Android devices. There's an additional Smart Backlight toggle in the Display Settings - this could be On or Off and we're not sure how it affects the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is reasonable all in all, but doesn't seem to help sunlight legibility, which suffers greatly form the highly reflective screen coating. The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue can be really frustrating at times to use outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue is powered by a 4100mAh Li-Po battery with an intelligent power management mode. Huawei claims it delivers 16 days of standby, 20 hours of voice calls and up to 6 to 8 hours of video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our results proved Huawei's estimations and even upped the company's voice call estimation by 2 hours. You can check the full battery test breakdown of the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Jelly Bean, Emotion UI 1.5 and no app drawer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean skinned with the home-brewed Emotion UI v1.5. The result is a very simple, flat interface with no app drawer. It seems, it was Huawei's goal to make it friendly and simple rather than rework Android beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the missing app drawer and the collapsible navigation bar, the rest is pretty straightforward and familiar, with most of the applications being the stock Android apps, with subtle Huawei touches here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is fairly busy. At its center is a circle with shortcuts in the four cardinal directions: simple unlock to the south, camera to the north, messaging to the east and dialer/call log to the west.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper area of the lockscreen displays the time and date. If the music player is running, the time and date are replaced by the music player controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is a fairly standard Android homescreen with five customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom. The default selection is phone app, messages, mail, web browser and contacts but you can have any app really, or folders with multiple items, visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six homescreen panes at most - at least a couple of them will accommodate actual apps. In the absence of an app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen. There're no shortcuts as such -the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will actually uninstall the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is fool-proof and you just can't accidentally uninstall essential apps like the gallery or email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside of the flat structure is you cannot get rarely used apps out of the way, but folders partially make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Alternatively, the overview can be displayed when you hit the Thumbnails shortcut in the menu that appears upon a tap and hold on a blank spot of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are available too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. The MediaPad 7 Vogue comes with a few Huawei-made widgets as well as the default Jelly Bean widgets. Of course, you can get third-party widgets off the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu displayed upon a tap and hold on the homescreen also lets you set wallpaper and homescreen transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live, static and scrollable static wallpapers are supported. You can activate the Shake to change wallpaper setting, or turn on Random change at a preset time interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile. There are 24 different lockscreen styles with different unlock gestures, time widgets and shortcut style and layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always opt for the default Android lockscreens - Face Unlock, Pattern, PIN or Password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features 7 toggles on a single row above the notifications list. Sadly, you can't rearrange or add and remove additional toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Android notifications stack up below the toggles. The notifications can be expanded or collapsed with a pinch gesture. You can also swipe to dismiss a notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A shortcut to the Settings Menu and a Dismiss All button are available in the top right corner of the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Music Player app is running in background, media player controls will be available in the notification area too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu is the stock Android one and is separated into two panes - the left is for the settings categories and the right is for the actual set of settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the task switcher. Its interface is the same as the stock Android Jelly Bean task switcher, but offers a few extra options. Each app thumbnail now has a dedicated close key (in addition to the default swipe to close gesture). There is also a "Kill all" key at the bottom that will terminate all running apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue gets activated with an upward-swipe from the virtual navigation bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue is powered by Huawei's own K3V2 chipset. There are four 1.5GHz Cortex A9 cores, a 16-core GPU and 1GB of RAM. The Cortex A9 processor is already a dated piece of tech, but it's still more than capable of keeping Android running smoothly on the 1024 x 600 pixels screen. The Samsung Galaxy SIII, for instance, uses a similar processor and it still gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with BenchmarkPi and Linpack, the MediaPad 7 Vogue posted pretty good scores, on par with the original ASUS Nexus 7 Of course, it wasn't able to match the more high-end rivals in our database.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many of the native apps on the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue come straight from Jelly Bean. The phonebook is just our first stop - it's laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one in the middle is the default tab, listing all contacts. Contacts are displayed with a name and a picture to the left. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent alphabet scroll on the right to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the contact image now brings up a tabbed popup. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers/addresses. These tabs can be swiped sideways too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view top row has a star to favorite a contact, a pencil to edit it, and a Settings button that lets you share, copy or delete a contact as well as set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is a list of all contact info sorted by category: phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more contact details. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even by group (so you can hide all contacts not in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue flaunts a SIM card slot, which allows it to place and receive regular calls. Thanks to the earpiece above the display you can easily use it just as a normal smartphone. Sure it's not the most comfortable experience, but it Huawei has decided to give the users this option as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound was good and loud and we had no issues with reception. The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue doesn't feature a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer offers a shortcut to the Contacts app and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the MediaPad 7 Vogue through our traditional loudspeaker test and it managed an Average score. We found its speaker to be reasonably loud, but it's not as good as its predecessor, which scored a Good mark. As a result, you might not be able to hear the MediaPad 7 Vogue in noisy environments which could result in missed calls or notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - which can be mass-deleted - and each thread is displayed like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 200 texts and 20 MMS per conversation). You can activate delivery reports, as well as read reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the first thing you'll notice is that Google has done away with the bottom bar that hosted buttons for new mail, search, labels, refresh and menu. Three of those have now been moved to the action bar on top and refresh has been integrated into the UI, in the shape of pull to refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app is a massive update over the old GTalk and offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard is quite comfortable to type on. You can switch to the default Android keyboard if you prefer, but Huawei's is bigger, making it easier to type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard has a few very useful options. First, you can change the keys' height - there are four different settings available and you can make the keys really big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you swipe left or right on the keyboard you'll access the old-fashioned keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Huawei hasn't included handwriting support for its keyboard on the MediaPad 7 Vogue. However, there are plenty of third-party alternatives on the Play Store that will give you such functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei Ascend Mate comes with the stock Android 4.1 Jelly image gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders in the phone as stacks of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), and People (if the photos have tagged faces in them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to show you that you've reached the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you view a single photo, you'll get Share, Delete and More Settings shortcuts above the photo. You can share a photo via DLNA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Picasa, MMS, Google+, Hangouts, Facebook, Twitter, Email and Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more options. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles editing videos and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects) add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an app that can completely eliminate the need of a computer for most people when creating videos. Plus Apple charges a good amount of money for the same functionality with their iMovie app. Same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is part of the gallery, will play anything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue doesn't have much of a video player - you just open videos from the gallery and that's that. On the up side, it handled most videos we threw at it - all the way up to 1080p, DivX, XviD, MKV and even WMV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video plus different sharing options. The video player UI also offers a lock button to prevent unintended touches as well as a pop-up play mode similar to Samsung's PopUp Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the integrated video player doesn't offer any equalizer presets. However, you can download a third-party movie player at any time in case you need extra functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue comes with an app called Music+ that is an updated version of the stock music player. The app is divided into two sections - Local music and Online music. Let's start with the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local music tab is straightforward - it shows all the songs that are loaded onto the slate. The Music+ app takes advantage of the 7" display and on the left displays the different song categorization methods: Playlists, Artists, Albums, Folders, Download manager or All songs. On the right, there's a laundry list with all the songs that match the aforementioned filtration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features more eye-candy including album art. Below it, the Music+ app will try to automatically load lyrics for the song you're playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the Music+ app is missing any equalizer settings, but has some interesting settings options such as sleep mode and hide short songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Online music mode uses a Huawei powered service to look for songs online. You can choose to display new songs or bring up music topics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clean audio output, but on the quiet side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue delivers excellently clean audio output when connected to an active external amplifier. Its volume levels are lower than we would have expected from a tablet, though so it's can't take an edge over the Nexus 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output quality barely takes a knock - the stereo crosstalk is the only affected reading. Volume levels remain fairly low, though, so the slate doesn't get full points here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3.2MP camera fails across the board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue has a 3.2MP fixed focus camera for maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. Unsurprisingly, Huawei hasn't included an LED flash to go with the slate's camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks pretty standard - you get a still/video camera toggle, a virtual shutter and a shortcut to the gallery on the right. The fun stuff is on the left side - you get multiple shooting modes (we'll cover those in a second), color effects and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top left, there's just one button for switching between the front and rear cameras. In terms of shooting modes, the MediaPad 7 Vogue doesn't have any. You can fiddle with the camera's exposure, contrast, brightness and saturation, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the settings menu you can enable things like geotagging, gridlines and adjust the white balance. The Volume Up key doubles as a hardware camera shutter inside the camera app. You can hold and it will take a picture upon release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you would imagine from a 3.2MP camera in a budget 7" tablet, the camera performance isn't going to shine. The MediaPad 7 Vogue's camera doesn't really capture great amount of fine detail and the post processing that takes places makes the photos a bit oversharpened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the colors look natural and the white balance is reasonably good. The noise levels aren't too high as well. One thing that the camera fails at is the highlights, which more often than not are clipped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows excellent results that can rival the best in the 3MP range. The noise-reduction is well-behaved, while white balance is quite accurate in artificial lighting.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder does 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate's main camera records videos at up to 720p@15fps, while the front facer is good for up to 480p@15fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is practically identical to that of the still camera. You lose the color effects option, but you can still enable the face effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are MP4 encoded at a bit rate of barely 7Mbps for 720p videos. There's stereo sound recorded at 96kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are is a 720p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube. You can also download a 720p sample taken directly from the MediaPad 7 Vogue here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity sans NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend mate comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and UMTS 900/2100MHz, meaning you'll be able to use it pretty much anywhere in the world. 3G comes with HSDPA and HSUPA - for up to 42Mbps downlink and 5.7Mbps uplink. There is no LTE support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 3.0 is also available but there's no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port on the Huawei Ascend mate also supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect mice/keyboards.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad 7 Vogue comes with two excellent web browsers - the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. The stock browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with a tabs and a settings shortcuts, and that's it. Hitting the Settings key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tab switching is handled in a similar way to switching between apps. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has Incognito mode (there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs). The other thing the browser does is preload search results when it's confident you'll click on them. These are two tricks borrowed from Google's desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are available from the Labs settings, which reveal three controls (Tabs, URL, More) when you tap anywhere on the edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still prefer the Chrome browser because of its cross-platform sync capabilities. It's absolutely identical in terms of interface, features (sans the Quick Controls), and behavior. Sometimes it's even faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is MIA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue doesn't sport an organizer application. While you can easily download one from the Play Store, we didn't expect Huawei to miss out on such an important aspect of the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyhow, you do get a proper file explorer - it has two tabs that handle the internal and external storage organized by folders. The app also handles ZIP files. It supports batch operations too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar features four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. World Clock, Stopwatch and Timer functions are available as additional tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a basic Notes app and a Sound recorder as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue comes with a GPS receiver, which took about 90 seconds to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need a rough estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad 7 comes with Google Maps and Navigation (region dependent). Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another from the Android Market - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Will a simple game plan and good looks help the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue keep its cool in a market that's changed dramatically in the course of a year or so? The original MediaPad may have had a chance against the first Nexus 7. Slim, but a chance nonetheless - and that's something the Vogue cannot even dream of against the new Google tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Asus Google Nexus 7 (2013) ? Asus Google Nexus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it's not all lost. Huawei might actually know what team to field and who they're playing against. If the Google tablets are well out of reach, why bother with high-res screens and latest-generation processors when they will make it next to impossible to match the Play Store prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad 7 Vogue has other targets instead. The memory card slot brings an extra dimension to the slate's multimedia consuming nature, and the SIM card is there for the occasional phone call. Not too many tablets have those, let alone both at once. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 easily comes across as a nearly perfect match there. And the fact that the MediaPad 7 Vogue has a quad-core processor against the dual-core CPU of the Samsung slate must be quite the morale-booster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True, it's of the Cortex A9 variety, which has seen a couple of years of service already, but it does have a clear edge over the dual-core Marvell chip inside the Galaxy Tab, at 1GB of RAM each. Both devices run Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 P3200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other seven-inchers that are more up the Vogue's alley include the likes of the ASUS Fonepad and the Lenovo IdeaTab A2107. The Atom-powered Fonepad boasts an WXGA screen and takes heavily after the original Nexus 7. The Lenovo tablet has a single-core CPU ticking inside and we're not sure of its prospects of getting Jelly Bean. Both gadgets have full telephony support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Lenovo IdeaTab A2107 ? Asus Fonepad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, regardless of its shortcomings, the Huawei MediaPad 7 Vogue manages to balance value and performance, looks and price. It's not as snappy as we would've liked, and its display pins it right at the bottom of the tablet food chain. Still, the full telephony is a nice, and rare, feature to have. The expandable memory and solid build check off the right boxes, too.</paragraph>
