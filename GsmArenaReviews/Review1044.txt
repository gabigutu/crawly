			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is everything an HTC fan has been longing for. A full smartphone package experience without compromise. The problem with this idea is that it doesn't exist, there will always be some phone with a better camera or better battery or a larger display. But we can always look at this idea subjectively and find the right balance between what the phone offers versus compromises you might be making.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been quiet in HTC camp lately but it seems the company has been gearing up for its big comeback this year. HTC's relevancy had been slipping away the past couple of years and the Taiwanese company thought it should buckle down and listen to what its customers have been saying for a while. And the fans, on the other hand, are excited to learn that "HTC is back!"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before the HTC 10, pretty much every iteration of the HTC One series in recent years brought some form of compromise. The HTC One M7 had a great camera, the first of its kind, the problem was only 4MP did not allow any sort of cropping without anyone noticing. The HTC One M8 had the same 4 megapixel camera and HTC made a bad choice to even remove OIS from the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One M9 was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough. Even with a bigger camera sensor this time around, the camera performance was still lackluster. The One M9 was also plagued with overheating problems caused by an early version of the Snapdragon 810 which had to be downclocked just to avoid the heating issues. As a result, the HTC's M9 unofficially became the flagship to avoid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is now here to hopefully break the chain of bad decisions. It's a proper flagship with hardly any shortcomings - it has better cameras, front facing OIS, superb build quality, great performance, Hi-Fi audio, booming sound quality, and battery life that meets or exceeds expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a couple of months before its announcement, HTC had been teasing the HTC 10's different features such as the hardware design, performance, battery life, captivating camera experience, Boom Sound, and capacitive navigation buttons. Many of these teasers were looked at with much speculation. After finally getting the retail product in our hands, will HTC be able to deliver all of its promises? Read on to find out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While quite simple, the HTC 10's packaging is straight to the point. Removing the lid reveals the HTC 10 straight away, wrapped in a protective layer of plastic. The top layer of packaging comes out to reveal more compartments underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last out of the box are the USB Charger and a cable with a USB Type-C end that is reversible and goes into the phone. This USB charger is a special one because it supports Qualcomm's new Quick Charge 3.0, which can charge the HTC 10 up to half capacity in less than half an hour. Which in itself, is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, our review device did not include the Hi-Fi earbuds that come with every retail version of the HTC 10 but we're assured this would only be the case in the US and Canada.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is beautifully designed, there is no doubt about it. Its industrial lines and heavy construction bring us back to the early-Android days with phones like the Nexus One and the EVO 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chamfered corner that goes all the way around the back give the phone tapered edges which help a lot with ergonomics and handling while also giving the HTC 10 some sharp, industrial looking lines, presenting itself as a sleek and powerful device. Before you write off the HTC 10 because of its seemingly large chamfered edges, make sure you feel it in hand first. The tapered edges on the back in conjunction with the curve toward the back of the phone only gives the illusion of it appearing thicker than it actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As soon as we saw the top of the device, we noticed there is no longer a black glossy insert that indicated an IR-blaster for controlling various home entertainment equipment. Strangely, most major phone brands are ditching the feature after being first to introduces it some years ago. It was a nice option to have, perhaps most customers were not using it because they weren't aware of the feature or simply didn't know how to set it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the IR bar we saw on the HTC One M9 has been replaced with a frosty gray plastic insert, which likely houses various connectivity antennas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smack dab in the center of the insert is the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is capable of up-scaling audio from 16-bit to 24-bit for an exceptional listening experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the buttons of the device are on the right side. From top to bottom is the volume rocker and underneath that sits a ruffle-textured power button, which is always a welcome touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The buttons themselves don't disappoint. They are very firm as to prevent accidental pressing in pockets or cases. While they take just a little more effort to push than you'd think, the buttons respond with the satisfying clicky-ness that everyone likes. The button layout might have you accidentally pressing the wrong keys but you get used to it after a day or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the device to the bottom we can see the little microphone used for phone calls, a Quick Charge 3.0-ready USB-C charging port, and the bottom firing speaker is also showcased on here on the bottom edge of the device. These speaker grilles are quite large compared to other phones' loudspeaker grilles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you hold the device in your hand and look at the front of the device, the first thing you notice is the big front facing camera, even with a black bezel, the camera takes your attention away from the mostly blank slate. Next to the camera is the earpiece which also acts as a co-operative loudspeaker. Just above the speaker are the LED notification, and light and proximity sensors, pretty standard stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Press the power button and you are greeted with the colorful 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 1440p display, the first time HTC bumped its screen up to a QHD resolution and the size up from the 5-inch HTC One M9. HTC's navigation buttons on the HTC One A9 make an appearance on HTC's main flagship model. The home button also doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which can be used to wake the phone from sleep. Just like on the HTC One A9, this sensor doubles as a home button, but it is not a mechanical button, rather just a capacitive key. We are glad there is no branding on the front of the HTC 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn the phone over to the back and here we are greeted with HTC's logo with black letters on a dark gray background. Very subtle branding, but a nice touch nonetheless. We are also glad HTC did not put any model numbers on the back either. A simple 10 could have done, but we support HTC's decision to only use the "HTC" logo exclusively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC logo is the Ultra Pixel 2 camera setup, we have the rear-facing 12MP camera which has been making headlines. To the right of the camera sensor is a dual-tone flash, and the autofocus laser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you look closely, you can also see a noise-cancelling microphone which also doubles as an audio recording mic during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When using the camera we found our fingers to cover the laser sensor on occasion. It's not annoying, but it can be if you're covering it often. Otherwise, the warning will quickly train you to keep your fingers as far away from the camera sensor as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Ice View case accessory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC offers the Ice View case as an official accessory and in its essence, it's not too different compared to the Dot View case that was offered alongside the M9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ice View case is simple to put on and is made of matte plastic at the back and a transparent cover at the front. The case does add a bith of thickness to the phone, but the protection it offers balances things out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the functionality side, double tapping on the front of the Ice View case wakes the phone up and shows you the time and date, and unseen notifications. You can access the camera, music player and call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the Dot View case, the Ice View one equally convenient. Without waking the phone up, you can control your music, take a photo and make a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have one gripe with the Ice View case, it's that the front cover blurs the screen a bit and a result fine-tuning the camera settings while the case is closed isn't quite an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With that said, the HTC Ice View case is a must-have accessory for the HTC 10 as it offers equal parts protection and convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After two iterations of HTC flagships using a 5-inch 1080p screen, HTC finally bumped up the resolution to the 1440 x 2560px category. There is also a slight size bump of 0.2 inches. The display also features curved edges crafted from Corning Gorilla Glass 4, though, these edges are so subtle, and you have to point it out to notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors don't shift when turning the screen about, but there is a variation in contrast when viewing from an angle. Nothing too drastic, though. The only place where you might have an issue is out in direct sunlight, seeing at the screen is not bright enough for such situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blacks on the HTC 10 were pretty good. Readings were lower than the average (this is good) when compared to others, but this was also the case with maximum brightness on the HTC 10. Because of the low blacks and low max brightness, the contrast ratio yielded quite a good result at 1543:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the HTC 10 display is good, but it's not on par with the current crop of flagships. The reason is a mixture of the screen's subpar max brightness and its reflectivity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 offers two settings for viewing colors, the default setting is Vivid and you can change it to sRGB which makes the screen just a tad warmer for more accurate looking colors. Both "Vivid" and sRGB offer a color temperature slider to tune the color profiles to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its default "Vivid" setting, the HTC 10 delivers a wonderful viewing experience. Colors are represented well enough where saturation isn't too overpowering. When moving the Vivid temperature slider a couple of notches warmer, colors become more accurate. Switching the display to the sRGB setting yields even more accurate colors and we found that the optimal setting in terms of color accuracy to be sRGB with extra two notches towards Warm on the temperature slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default "Vivid" setting yields an average DeltaE or 5.7 with a maximum DeltaE of 10.9. The best color representation, which we were able to squeeze out by using the available adjustment settings in sRGB as described above, improved the color rendition deviation down to an Avg. DeltaE of 2.9 and max DeltaE of 5.8, which is a solid result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 comes with a nanoSIM tray and a microSD tray, both placed opposite from each other so you don't need to disconnect your phone just to get to the expandable memory. The HTC 10 connects to standard HSPA networks, and LTE Cat. 9 with theoretical download/upload speeds of 450/50 Mbps. The handset supports many FDD LTE bands: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 17, 20, 28, 29, 30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC offers a full suite of connectivity options: Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac 2.4 and 5GHz, USB Type-C, NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi calling is also baked into our non-carrier model, which so far we've only been able to test with T-Mobile in the US.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, however, HTC decided to omit the IR Blaster and the FM Radio from the new HTC 10. While the IR-Blaster might not be a big deal for some, absence of FM Radio connectivity might irritate international customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bright side, the USB Type-C port supports DisplayPort output if you use a USB Type-C cable for TV-out connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the DisplayPort, the HTC 10 also supports Apple's AirPlay casting out of the box, which is a rarity in Android phone and so far, we've only seen in implemented on several Xiaomi phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC 10 Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10's battery has received a minor increase in capacity from 2,840mAh in the One M9 to 3,000mAh. Compared to the One M9, this modest bump of capacity in collaboration with Marshmallow's battery optimization were able to offset the increase in resolution and screen size up from 1080p to 1440p and 5.0" to 5.2" screens, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the HTC 10 performed rather average in all tests. For starters, the HTC 10 scored a calling time of 20:42, just two minutes below the One M9. Video and browsing tests offered a rather significant improvement up from the One M9 at 8:42h for video and 9:08h of browsing, whereas the One M9 scored less with 7:31h of browsing and 8:21h of video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While these are somewhat significant increases in stamina, the HTC 10's score is dead center between its direct competitors like the Galaxy S7 and LG G5. The LG G5 yields a battery score of 60h, while the HTC 10 scored 66h overall, with the Galaxy S7 (Exynos) scoring a much better 80h score overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 scored a 66h endurance rating overall, which is the time the HTC 10 would last you on a single charge if you use it for 1 hour of calling, 1 hour of video, and 1 hour of web browsing per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 supports Quick Charge 3.0 right out of the box, so charging up won't be an issue. The USB 3.0 charger has a regular USB Type-A connector while the other end of the cable has the USB-C plug. This technically means you could use any Quick Charge 2.0 compliant adapter as well, since Quick Charge is backwards compatible. You still might have trouble casually borrowing a USB-C cord as they are not too widely popular yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've depleted the HTC 10's battery to 0% and hooked it up to the QC 3.0 charger for exactly 30 minutes and our unit was able to reach 50% on the dot. This is, however, under the ideal condition of very little heat. Airflow and ambient temperature both play important factors in how fast a phone can charge. 50% in 30 minutes is possible and we were only able to do it under our controlled conditions. Using the phone while its charging or placing it on a bed or soft surface will keep it warmer than it needs to be and affect charging performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary rating denotes the number of hours the phone will be operational if you are to make an hour of 3G talks, web browsing and video playback per day. Such usage pattern may not apply to you directly, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense UI has been simplified a lot. Today, HTC says they've trimmed all the fat from the Sense UI, meaning they've gotten rid of some of the redundant applications that co-existed with Google's editions of such apps like HTC Internet, Fun Fit, Scribble, and Polaris Office. These apps were replaced with Chrome, Google Fit, Google Keep, and Google Docs, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's lock screen is a simple swipe up to unlock, unless you've got a fingerprint registered. In this case all you need to do is touch the sensor and the phone will wake up, bypassing the lock screen. Otherwise, you can swipe up on the lock screen to unlock. Swiping up on the shortcuts in the lock screen will launch these apps directly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense UI offers themes right out of the box. You can browse themes right from the launcher's menu and there is a variety of themes to choose from. Some of those themes come with Freeplay mode, which allows you to place widgets, icons and stickers anywhere on the screen without sticking to a grid arrangement. The different elements can even overlap each other, if you need this sort of thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's app drawer is set to a custom method of organization by default. All of the preinstalled apps are arranged in a single page of the app drawer and any additional apps will be shown in the second page in the order they were downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the launcher to alphabetize your apps or organize them by most recently installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer also features convenient shortcuts to access the Play Store, Search for installed apps, and a menu that lets you rearrange apps in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is found again on the home screen but it's less annoying than before. Out of the box, BlinkFeed is empty, so you need to manually add content to it for it to start providing you with news, videos, and content to satisfy your need for feed. BlinkFeed continues to be somewhat useful but still does not offer a compelling enough reason for customers to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on Tap has made it to the HTC 10 and you can activate it by holding the capacitive home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case this is important to you, holding longer the Recents key will act as a "menu" button. But all apps have had hamburger menus and 3-dot buttons for a while and there is hardly any need for the menu button on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's interesting about the HTC Sense skin this time is seeing how minimal it has become when compared to previous versions. The settings and quick toggles have been minimally skinned and mostly come with a stock-Android look with just a bit of sprucing up here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is great news, a heavily skinned UI means more sluggish performance and slower software updates, and the HTC 10 seems to be on the right track in this regard. It provides users with a unique user-experience without bogging down the system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's stock keyboard is based on the Touch Pal keyboard with tweaks to make it an HTC Sense version. The keyboard is quick and works fairly well, as long as you are typing the in the language of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of us can get away with typing the occasional four or five words in another language without switching the keyboard from English. The keyboard is so tedious at doing that, especially when the word is being corrected to two or more words. The original word is gone, even after backspacing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the HTC 10 waking up many times unintentionally. The display fires up even when just brushing a part of your body on the fingerprint scanner, such as your palm or your arm. When taking the HTC 10 for a jog, we found the screen turning on all by itself for no reason. Just holding a finger over the screen activated the double-tap to wake feature incessantly. Thankfully, you can disable both of these features from waking the phone up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing worth noting, the lock screen notifications behave differently than what we're used to. Usually, with a Nexus or Samsung device running Marshmallow, for instance, you can tap the notification once to select it, and then you can unlock your device by either swipe or fingerprint, then you'll be taken to the app immediately. The problem is, the HTC 10's lock screen notifications don't behave this same way. Even though the first tap highlights the notification, unlocking the device right after this won't pop you into the app. Instead, you'll need to double tap before unlocking in order to see the app. This isn't a huge deal, but it's not consistent with how Android is supposed to behave.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Preinstalled apps, SMS, and allocated storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our HTC 10 unit is the unlocked model and it came with minimal software preinstalled. HTC says it has trimmed the fat on its HTC Sense software by removing any duplicate programs. Indeed, it has become a lean, mean machine. There are a total of 34 app icons, all of which fit into a single app drawer page, seeing as some of them are grouped into folders. Carrier versions of the device will have a varying app package depending on the carrier. The Gallery, Music player, and Calendar are all Google's own offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These pre-installed apps could theoretically be disabled if you wanted to, though, there is no straightforward way of doing so from the app drawer as dragging the icon only prompts you to cancel your action. You'd have to go into the application manager and manually disable the apps you don't want to use - say Facebook and its Messenger, and Instagram if you are not into social networking. These three apps, by the way, are the only social networks pre-installed on the HTC 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock SMS app is a simplified version of Google's own Messenger, but you're better off downloading another app as it does this one thing that we find quite annoying - it closes the keyboard every time you send a message. So you can't fire off messages as you type them because you'll be interrupted by the keyboard hiding. The original Google's Messenger app, for instance, does not behave this way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Allocated Storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our 32GB unlocked model came with 23.17GB of available storage after formatting, system, pre-installed apps and such. The preinstalled apps mentioned earlier take up about 770MB of the device. Thankfully, though, if this is not enough storage, you can always load up the microSD card tray for some more storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is powered by a Snapdragon 820 CPU with two Kyro cores clocked at 2.15GHz &amp; two Kyro cores clocked at just 1.6 GHz. The Snapdragon 820 is the first CPU for which Qualcomm finally decided they didn't need more cores but better ones. The new chipset is paired with generous 4GB of RAM and a dedicated Adreno 530 GPU for graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, a single Kryo core is a beast, and currently it's one of the best solutions on the market together with Apple's Twister CPU. The single-core performance is crucial for smooth OS operations, and the Kryo cores are up to the task.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core score isn't as impressive, because there are only four Kryo cores inside the Snapdragon 820, while the Kirin 955 in Huawei P9, or the Exynos chip inside the Galaxy S7 feature octa-core processors. Still, considering the number of cores, we could easily consider those points as an excellent grade.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 easily aced the AnTuTu 6, and it bested the rest of its siblings by a huge margin. Since the HTC 10 has similar hardware to the LG G5, we guess some software optimizations are the reason for the great performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark OS II compound bench outed an oddly low score, which makes us believe there might be some problem with the app itself and the new Sense UI. We'll redo this test when possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC 10 uses the latest Adreno 530, which is the best GPU on the market right now. The off-screen GPU benchmarks below prove that.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Running the GPU test on the native 1440p resolution takes a serious toll on framerates, but they remain flagship-grade. The Mi 5, which has the same GPU but runs on 1080p, expectedly does better here.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC 10 scores speak for themselves - the new flagship delivers a stellar performance, and we expected nothing less from a Snapdragon 820 smartphone. The chip is sure to serve the HTC 10 hassle-free for the years to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening apps, loading games, switching between social apps, games, and productivity apps are all tasks that the HTC 10 is able to do very well with minimal stuttering. The fluidness of the HTC 10 reminds us this is how a smartphone should behave.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internal storage performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 uses the more conventional Embedded Multi-Media Controller (eMMC) 5.1 NAND memory, which, when compared to Samsung?s Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.1 NAND, is significantly lower in read/write performance than the newer UFS 2.1 standard of flash memory. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and the LG G5 both use this UFS memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the popular memory Benchmark AndroBench in order to find out just how the three flagships compare in 4 different memory tests: Sequential read (which measures the speed of reading a single file), sequential write (measures the speed of a single file being saved onto the memory), random read (speed of memory when reading data from multiple locations at once), and random write (speed of writing to multiple locations at once).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These tests help to determine how the phones might perform under certain conditions and explains why a phone often slows down when there are too many background processes performing work all at once.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sequential Read, MB/s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These sequential read numbers clearly show how much faster the new UFS memory technology is when compared to the eMMC 5.1 standard found in the HTC 10. The HTC 10 yielded 44% slower results than the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge did in this regard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sequential Write, MB/s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 runs right in the middle of the other two flagships in the sequential writing test. The highest scoring device in this category was the LG G5 at 156.4 MB/s and the lowest was the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge at 89.83 MB/s. Sequential writing is performed when transferring a file from one folder to another, for instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Random Read, MB/s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>MB/s, Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the random read test, the HTC 10 performed much slower than the other two flagship devices. While random performance is dependent on a number of factors, the phone would still be significantly faster if it had UFS type storage instead of eMMC. The random reading speed of the HTC 10 was 30.25 MB/s while the LG G5 and Galaxy S7 edge both scored 123 MB/s and 86.12 MB/s, respectively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Random Write, MB/s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>MB/s, Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 came up second in the random write speed tests. However, these flagships are pretty close to each other when it comes to this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wouldn?t want our readers to get the wrong message. The HTC 10 is still blazing fast in every day performance. UI, launching apps, and such are all still exceedingly snappy for day to day. However, we just want you to know that if you really did want to get a phone that works faster in this aspect, you have a couple of other choices.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case you did not know, the Unlocked version of the HTC 10 is compatible with T-Mobile's Wi-Fi Calling feature and of course other carriers, which support it. This is thanks to Google baking this feature into Android which also explains why Nexus devices after the Nexus 6 are also capable of native Wi-Fi calling for particular carriers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone calls on the HTC 10 sounded clear, but not loud enough for our liking. HTC should tweak the sound of the earpiece to allow more volume through the earpiece during a phone call. It feels like the current max volume is like 65%-70% of what it could/should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10's dialer is mostly unchanged from the One M9. There are tabs at the top of the dialer which lets you choose between Call History, Phone (to dial out), Favorites, People, and Groups. These tabs can be rearranged or hidden from the Dialer app by accessing the Call settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BoomSound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This time around, HTC decided to tweak the BoomSound setup a bit and designed the HTC 10 with two different kinds of speakers. Rather than having two front-facing speakers, one that mirrors the other, HTC decided to move the lower speaker from under the display to the bottom of the phone, right next to the charger port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving the lower speaker to the bottom made it easier for HTC to put capacitive buttons and a fingerprint scanner on the chin of the phone right below the screen. This helps to keep the lower bezel's size down and also gives a good aesthetic balance to the speaker above. The lower speaker's position allow us to hear the device ring in cases where the phone might be face-down or in a jeans pocket. Good thing too, since the HTC 10 scored the lowest in our loudness test between the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the case with phones nowadays as dual speakers are meant more for the listening experience rather than just being loud. It's safe to say you can't expect to buy this phone to listen to music while doing other things like cooking, showering, or washing your car. These scenarios might demand something louder like a Bluetooth speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front facing speaker also doubles as the earpiece, and while this speaker is designed for mids and highs, the bottom firing speaker is tuned more for mids to lows and bass. Audio sounds crisp and clear with no distortion, although, lower bass sounds are more "plop" than "punch", but you can't expect much more from two little speakers on a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anytime you play some kind of audio on the HTC 10, a notification displays the current audio mode, of which there are two to choose from. The phone comes with "Theater mode" enabled by default, and there is also a "Music mode". Theater mode is best used when watching a video or playing a game, or listening to music while you use your phone. Basically it's best for any time you are actively using your phone. Music mode is more for playing music and setting it aside while you do something else. Whichever mode ou choose, sound quality on the BoomSound speakers definitely does not disappoint, but the audio in the Theater setting feels more immersive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is yet another case of the Taiwanese company getting the audio output just right. The flagship delivered an impressive output when used with an active external amplifier, getting top marks for clarity and garnishing them with nicely high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Degradation caused by headphones is minimal too with a minor hike in stereo crosstalk being the only notable change. Volume remained very high and clarity was still great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UltraPixel 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's history with cameras on its flagships has been a mixed bag. Its first attempt at delivering higher-quality camera was with the One M7, which came with a 4MP camera sensor at a time when flagships already touted 13MP cameras. HTC hoped that users would prefer a camera with bigger pixels as opposed to one in higher number of pixels, but the market showed otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the company used the camera sensor in its next flagship as well - the One M8 - which also had a second sensor for capturing the scene depth and applying filters based on that. The market had another laugh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the HTC One M9 HTC returned to a conventional 20MP camera setup but it hardly had any success either as the image quality wasn't class leading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest HTC 10, it claims that the 12MP camera has what they like to call UltraPixel 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The move from more pixels to bigger pixels is a trend that was resurrected in the second half of 2015 by HTC's biggest competitors. Today, all the flagship phones by Google (the Nexus partners Huawei and LG), Apple, Samsung have 12MP cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original UltraPixel camera had 2µm pixels but they were only 4MP in total. So pictures came out great but cropping any of them resulted in pixelated images because of the low resolution. The new sensor has 1.55µm pixels but about 3 times as many pixels as the original 4MP sensor from the One M7 and One M8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the specs, it seems the HTC 10 is using the same image sensor as the one on the two current Nexus phones - the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. These two have the same size 1/2.3" 12MP camera sensor with the same size 1.55µm pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The implementation on the HTC 10 however has its benefits, as it comes with Optical Stabilization System (OIS), which lacks on the Nexus phones. It also has an f/1.8 aperture, as opposed to f/2.0 on the Google-commissioned phones. The dual-tone LED flash is another special feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw a laser autofocus implementation on the Nexus phones and the HTC 10 has it too. It is for the first time, however, that we see a notification in the camera viewfinder whenever we accidentally place a finger over the laser autfocus. We kind of wish more phones did this. You have got to remember that the laser focusing aid is still limited and it barely works over distances longer than 1m from the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera launches quickly, just a few notches slower than the Galaxy S7 edge, however, there is no hardware shortcut to quickly launch the camera like the Galaxy S7 edge's double-press of the home button. The quickest way to do so is by pressing the wake button and then slide the camera shortcut up to the middle of the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app is pretty straightforward, there are only two toggles on screen which are flash and HDR mode and between those two there is a drawer which contains all the settings and different camera modes: Slow motion, Hyperlapse, Pro, Panorama, and Zoe Camera which records 3 seconds of HD video after pressing the shutter button. This is a variation of Samsung's Motion photo or iPhone's Live photos but it's worth noting that it was HTC who came up with the original picture+video concept first back in 2013 on the HTC One M7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera app does have a manual professional mode that offers more control over your snapshots and it even offers the ability to shoot RAW images. By default, Pro mode is set to take photos in RAW mode but you can switch it to JPG if you wish. If you are using Pro mode, we assume you know what you're doing. You can change the white balance, ISO, shutter speed, and manually focus the lens. And of course since there is no way to change the fixed aperture, there is an exposure slider to compensate. You can just as easily use Pro mode and leave everything in Auto to simply take RAW images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples of the HTC 10 with varying light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 performs well in many various settings of light. Some of these shots were in bright sunlight, and others, starting from the fountain, onward, were taking after the sun began setting. In some situations, the HTC 10 fails to represent the dynamic ranges in lighting such as when there is light coming from behind the subject. The Galaxy S7 edge performs better in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10, is able to capture greatly accurate colors throughout, however the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge captures deeper and more vibrant colors that are more pleasing to the eye than those of the HTC 10. Speckles and noise becomes a bit apparent in the dark underexposed areas of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When compared, these darker areas in photos of the Galaxy S7 edge appear sharper and more in-focus. The only photo of the HTC 10 where colors were less than desirable is the one with the fountain in the foreground. The colors went too cool and gave the scene a pink and pale haze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong, the HTC 10's camera met and exceeded our expectations. We are simply putting it to a standard that it set for itself when HTC was teasing its camera. DxOMark gave both the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge the same score of 88 though we're inclined to disagree as from our experience the S7/S7 edge duo has the upper hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Texture details on the HTC 10 could certainly be better. The Galaxy S7 edge's dual pixel, in which every pixel can be used for focusing, has a competitive advantage in focusing speed as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while the HTC 10 contains less noise in lower light situations than the Galaxy S7 edge's wavy effect in low light, the Galaxy S7 edge is able to illuminate very dark scenes better but as a result, there is noticeably more noise throughout the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same effect is seen here. The Galaxy S7 edge is able to capture more light thanks to its f/1.7 aperture VS the HTC 10's f/1.8 aperture. Again, the tradeoff is the significant amount of noise seen in the Galaxy S7 edge's shot. These were some very dark scenes, probably one's you'd never intentionally take pictures of people in. But if you really had to, you have already seen the varying performances of these devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos taken with HDR look better in the dynamic range department. Shadows are brought slightly out of the dark and notice the highlights in the sky and clouds are brought down. This brings out the depth and shadows of the clouds for better general effect. The opposite effect can be seen in the palm trees. These palm trees now have more depth and overall lighting thanks to HDR more. We always recommend leaving HDR mode in AUTO in order to best capture the scenario in front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 has a better performing front facing camera thanks to HTC's decision to put OIS on the front facing camera. Lighting is more representative of the actual scene than that depicted from the Galaxy S7 edge. The last selfie looks more processed coming out of the Galaxy S7 edge than the HTC 10. Again, this is really nitpicking at it, as both cameras still perfom very well, all-around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to check out how the HTC 10 compares against other smartphones we've tested in our Photo compare tool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 can pump out 720p, 1080p, or 4K videos all in 30fps, unfortunately, it does not look like there is a 60fps option on any of the video resolution settings. The 1080p videos are extra smooth thanks to the added benefit of the electronic image stabilization. It takes a slight toll on the camera's field of view, but you can always turn it off if that bugs you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie camera appears to top off at just the 1080p resolution. 4K videos are shot with a 55Mbps bitrate while 1080p videos are 20Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K videos look great and the same color representation is maintained just as the HTC 10's photos. Details are excellent and OIS is working hard during video recording to bring us these details. In 4K mode there is no electronic image stabilization as is the case with many phones that shoot 4K these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either video mode will get you smooth looking videos with the occasional refocus, depending on what you're filing, of course. No major complaints with the video quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video samples: 1080p at 30fps (15s, 37MB), 4K at 30fps (15s, 107MB)</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC 10 key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build quality, sturdy body, does not dent upon impact, only nicks the paint. A teeny bit on the heavier side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharp 5.2 inch QHD screen delivers pleasantly punchy and vibrant colors. The software lets you tune the color accuracy to your personal preference. Sunlight visibility is not bad, but other competitors have it better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a 66h overall score, battery life could be better. Especially when direct competitors have been scoring significantly better in similar tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprint scanner could potentially wake the phone unintentionally but is quick and accurate nonetheless. The unintentional wake-ups can be avoided by deactivating the sensor's wake up feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 8.0 is the leanest version of HTC's Android skin we've seen so far. Bloatware was kept to a minimum and HTC got rid of duplicate apps for Google's apps offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Processing power is among the best-performing smartphones to date. Using it excessively could occasionally cause the phone to become very warm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BoomSound speakers deliver a rich and immersive audio experience with less than stellar bass performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built-in headphone jack has a dedicated amp that offers excellent audio clarity and minimal degradation with headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images taken with the HTC 10 have great detail and color accuracy, lower light photos look great. Front facing camera performs well for lower light selfies. Dynamic range overall could be a touch better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos recorded by the HTC 10 Look great - detail is rich and lines are crisp, with the occasional shutter refocus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is a hit. It took the best parts of its previous flagship devices and refined them into a single package that will have the other competitors sweating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 is a compelling device with lots of processing power, beautifully designed and sturdy hardware, great camera performance, fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, and excellent audio quality both via the speakers and the headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC fans everywhere will be happy with the result, and they will be happy to become new owners. Especially if you are still hanging onto your HTC One M7 or M8, you will want to get your hands on the HTC 10. It is everything the M9 should have been and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are getting to a point in the mobile industry where the line of compromise is fading away. However, that line is still somewhat visible in the HTC 10. Although the HTC 10 battery life was not bad at all, it still was a potential opportunity for the phone to improve as its competitors scored better in these tests. We also noticed some minor inconsistencies in the UI and there is a lack of prominent apps or software features that may tilt the scales further in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 offers a similar software experience but offers a different type of hardware package. The G5's modular design lets you swap the battery, add Hi-Fi audio, or a camera grip. Also the dual camera with wide angle lens offers something unique that no other competitors does. The average battery life of the LG G5 is perhaps its only downside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG added a mid-cycle phone as an exception to its flagship line called the LG V10. A compelling offering with a larger 5.5-inch screen, bells, and whistles, and of course we can't forget the secondary mini-display that sits right over the primary display for notifications and other UI tasks. You should be able to find one for a lower price than the HTC 10, both are sturdy and durable and offer great camera experiences. But although both have the same size battery, the V10 has to power more features to keep up so battery life is its weakest point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's offerings this year are the ones to beat. Both offer compelling and beautifully designed hardware and similar camera experiences. Still, the HTC 10 is hard to choose over the S7 because of its better battery scores, water resistance certification, multi-window multi-tasking, and Samsung's TouchWiz software suite. The price point isn't as competitively priced as it should be, but if TouchWiz is something that irks you, perhaps the HTC 10 would be a great fit with its lean software skin, BoomSound speakers and excellent camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lately the Galaxy S7 edge has been spotted on eBay unlocked for less than the pre-order price of the HTC 10 offering more than the S7 with its bigger battery, larger screen, and edge features. Just as mentioned above, the S7 edge has more value-added features that make the HTC 10 difficult to choose over it at the current price levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We decided to add the Nexus 5X in here because both devices are about the same size and offer a comparable camera experience. Even though the HTC 10 is more than twice the price of the Nexus 5X in some places, maybe you only need the bare essentials with a great camera offering for a great price. The Nexus 5X's build quality, however, is not comparable to HTC's sturdy construction. There is also no expandable memory on the Nexus 5X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's offering needed to be included here as well. Both phones offer exceptional camera experiences, but the iPhone does not (and probably won't ever) offer expandable storage. HTC does offer a better sound experience and better build quality. Both phones, though, offer great performance and a similar overall battery score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do wish Sony's offerings had a better presence in the US because the Sony Xperia Z5 is an overall great phone with a software skin that adds value and whose lineup offers water resistance. You can even buy the Xperia Z5 at Best Buy for $500. Sony's offering gets you a nice camera, a waterproof design and it offers better battery life than the HTC 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it could be a priced just a bit more competitively, the HTC 10 is a great upgrade for owners of any of HTC's previous flagships. The excellent hardware build is sure to satisfy anyone with a hunger for quality hunters. Meanwhile, those who are looking for something other than an occasionally lagging UI (we're looking at you, TouchWiz!) will surely love Sense 8.0's super fast and fluid animations throughout, but this comes at the expense of missing features like multi-window or water-resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only regard where we don't think the HTC 10 is worth its $700 price tag is in battery life. If only they had focused more on the battery performance. Thankfully, the Quick Charge 3.0 adapter included in the box offsets this quite nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we are glad HTC has finally started believing in itself. This time around they come more prepared and more attuned to the user needs than ever before in recent history. Hopefully, the HTC 10 will put the company back on the flagship smartphone map.</paragraph>
