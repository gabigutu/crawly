			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A year after the first generation took the smartwatch world by storm with its timeless looks, it is time for the new Moto 360 to step up to the plate. The new iteration of Motorola's acclaimed Android Wear device arrives on the market with revamped design, highly customizable body in two sizes, a version designed for ladies, and a brand new Sport model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, in addition to new looks and levels of customizability, the new Moto 360 also features improved hardware over the first generation. The newcomer packs a more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 solution, sharper display, and bigger battery. Take a look at its key features below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard for the segment Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC found in the new Moto 360 promises speedier performance and faster firmware updates than in the outgoing model. The latter features a TI OMAP 3 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year's Moto 360 is now fully customizable in Moto Maker too - users can choose from roughly 300 possible combinations of size, metal finish, body textures and accents, and wristband. This particular feature will be a key for the new smartwatch, as no competitor comes close to offering such levels of personalization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharper display is a welcome sight too. Once again it is not completely circular, though Motorola officials pointed that this setup is what allows the Moto 360 to feature ultra-thin bezels and bigger battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto 360 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At a quick glance, the new Moto 360 is unmistakably a member of Motorola's smartwatch family thanks to its circular body and, more importantly, display with ultra-thin bezels. However, the addition of traditional watch lugs make the new wearable device look more mature than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the above mentioned lugs are small design elements, the impact that they have on the appearance of the device is huge - this year's Moto 360 looks like a traditional watch. For comparison, last year's iteration looks more futuristic in comparison due to the seamlessly integrated bands into its body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall build quality of the smartwatch is excellent. Moto 360 is made of 316L stainless steel and Corning Gorilla Glass 3, so it will handle daily use and abuse without breaking a sweat. Motorola's watch bands on the other hand, are either made from steel or from genuine Horween leather - they will certainly hold up well again normal wear.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of both Moto 360 variants is now considerably sharper than last year's iteration. The unit is once again not fully circular in order to make space for the easy integration of sensors into the Moto 360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, Motorola execs defended the choice of screen shape with the superb screen-to-body ratio of the new Moto 360. At 71.7%, it is considerably better than all of its competitors'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life, just like in case of the first Moto 360, having a display that's not fully circular is not a deal breaker, so long as you use a dark watch face. Opting for a light one however, immediately draws the attention to the unconventional shape of the unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto Maker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Introduced alongside the original Moto X in 2013, Moto Maker is now fully available for buyers of the new Moto 360 as well. There are roughly 300 different combinations of color, finish, and band for the smartwatch, so users can truly have it their way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the regular 42mm and 46mm Moto 360, users can choose from black, silver, or gold stainless steel finishes for the body and the bezel (you can mix them if you wish). Bezel treatments include chamfer and micro knurl, while wristband options feature silver, black, and gold metal, as well as black or cognac Horween leather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The women's variant of the smartwatch is available in silver, gold, or rose gold body and bezel color. The bezels can be ordered in peak or micro etch finish, while the available 16mm bands include silver, gold, and rose gold metal, blush and grey leather, as well as blush double wrap leather.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto 360 Sport quick look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moto 360 Sport, as its name suggests is a version of the wearable with enhanced fitness tracking capabilities. The device is the only Moto 360 member with built-in GPS. It also features a proprietary AnyLight hybrid display by Motorola with enhanced sunlight visibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola will introduce the Moto 360 Sport at a later date, so we only got a chance to take a look at mockups of the smartwatch. The device will be available in three different colors - white, black, and orange when it hits the shelves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With attractive design and highly customizable body, the new Moto 360 promises to attract plenty of attention. Specs are not the same difference maker in the wearable realm as they are in the smartphone one, so, with the help of Moto Maker and a solid marketing push by Lenovo and Motorola, this year's Moto 360 will almost certainly be among the major players in the expanding market for wearables in the months ahead.</paragraph>
