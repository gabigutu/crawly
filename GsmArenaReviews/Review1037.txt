		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going by sales in the past year alone, it's easy to forget that HTC still makes some of the best hardware in the smartphone game. Despite the fact that it was the first to release a smartphone with a dual-core Krait chipset, the first to launch a quad-core, and the first to put a fullHD display on a phone, the company's market share has dwindled over the last few quarters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, while there wasn't much wrong with the HTC One S and One X, they both failed to realize their potential for various reasons. For one, the Taiwanese company got their marketing messed up of both the early summer releases and the Q4 holiday offerings. That's something they acknowledged and promised to work on in earnest in 2013.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger problem, however, was that while great, the One series devices fell slightly short of their Samsung Galaxy rivals, which took the market by storm. So, is the HTC Butterfly ready to push harder and bring the company back to the top of the smartphone game? Judging by this juicy specs sheet, it certainly has what it takes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The devil was in the details last time around and this time HTC has done all it can to iron out even the smallest creases, turning the Butterfly into a package that makes smartphone enthusiasts drool. Little things like a curved glass display or an extra gig of RAM can make the right kind of difference when the competition is as tight as the one between premium Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news for HTC right out the gate is that Sony will seemingly have an advantage in most markets as the Xperia Z is getting ready to hit the shelves as we speak. Yet, as we found out during our review, the glass-clad Japanese flagship has a weak point that might be taken advantage of, allowing the Butterfly to make up for the delay. The screen of the Xperia Z was somewhat underwhelming in terms of viewing angles and contrast and if the Butterfly does better there, it might just turn out to be the better overall package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new version of the company's Sense UI is another mystery that needs to be looked into. Last time around, we found Samsung's TouchWiz to have an advantage in functionality, even though HTC's solution was generally more consistent and better-looking. A step forward in the software department is in order if the Butterfly is to aim for the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get down to testing and find more about it then. The hardware checkup begins right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At some point during the past couple of years, manufacturers decided that supplying nice extras in the retail package of their smartphones didn't pay off, and started shipping all devices with the same basic set of accessories. HTC made a few exceptions to this rule when it acquired Beats audio and released a few of its flagship devices with above average headphones in-box, but the recent financial trouble made even the Taiwanese give up on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, the HTC butterfly comes with a run-of-the-mill pair of headphones alongside a wall-mount plug that you use together with the supplied USB cable to charge your phone. There's also an HTC-branded SIM eject tool that lets you replace the microSIM card. Our review unit didn't even have the headphones, but you'll get them in most markets as part of the bundle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Butterfly 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly measures 143 x 70.5 x 9.1mm, which means it has slightly higher volume than the Sony Xperia Z, which had a marvelously slim 7.9mm body. However, the Butterfly is slightly narrower (0.5mm), which, combined with the curved glass display, means it's not much harder to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC flagship also uses hardware keys instead of on-screen ones, which means that you are actually getting more screen estate than on the Xperia Z. At 140g, the Butterfly is also slightly lighter than its Sony competitor, but it does use a 2020mAh battery, as opposed to the Z's 2330mAh unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly uses a polycarbonate unibody which is largely reminiscent of the HTC One X, but comes with a few nice touches to freshen it up. The red accent on the speakerphone grille sits nicely, though its appeal is slightly reduced by the large amount of unused space around it. There are more red grilles on the sides, which also add to the character of the smartphone, but you won't find too many other red elements along the exterior of the device, like you would on its US counterpart, the DROID DNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smooth black back is quite the looker at first with its only problem being that once dirty, it's really hard to clean. We think HTC has slightly altered the type of polycarbonate it uses since it unveiled the One series, but we're not sure whether it's a change for the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we're sure it will turn many heads even when its gorgeous screen is switched off. In fact, the only smartphone chassis (from both this year and late 2012) that currently has an advantage over the HTC Butterfly in terms of looks is the Sony Xperia Z with front and back panel glass-clad design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the right of the earpiece and the 2.1MP 1080p front-facing camera on the left. Once again, HTC has put in a wide-angle front-facing camera, which lets you fit more into the frame when doing video chats (there's no native video call support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find the three controls typical of HTC droids. The haptic-enabled capacitive touch Back, Home and Task switcher keys are well-spaced and very responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC Butterfly is completely bare, while the right side holds the volume rocker. Unfortunately, this is yet another Android flagship to come without a camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find a secondary microphone, the 3.5mm audio jack, and a small plastic flap under which reside the microSD card slot and the microSIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key was also placed here, which makes it pretty inconvenient to use. Instead of putting it on one of the sides of the Butterfly, where it would have been easy to reach with your thumb or index finger, HTC has placed the most used hardware button on the place that is the hardest to reach. Unless you are Shaquille O'Neil, you'll probably need to use a second hand or risk dropping the phone every time you lock/unlock it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make matters worse the button is almost flat with the surrounding plastic, making it very hard to press. It's not the first time HTC has made a blunder like that either - the HTC Windows Phone 8X had a similar fate and so did the One X/X+ (although the buttons on those two were at least easier to press, and not in the exact center of the top panel).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece and the microUSB port, which is used for data transfers, charging, and thanks to its MHL support, TV-out. With an MHL adapter you'll be able to output 1080p content to your HDTV directly from your phone, so purchasing one is probably worth it. Unfortunately, we found the plastic cover over the microUSB port very stiff and hard to open, which is not ideal considering how often you'll use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC Butterfly features the 8MP camera lens and the LED flash right next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements at the back are the loudspeaker grille near the bottom and the Beats audio logo right above it. You should keep in mind though that the audio enhancements are only available when you have connected a pair of headphones and not when using the loudspeaker itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly is powered by a non-user-replaceable 2020 Li-Ion battery. HTC didn't provide official endurance ratings for it and the relatively low capacity (it's the smallest unit of the three 5" 1080p smartphones we've seen so far) did have a lot of people worried about its endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out though, the HTC Butterfly posted a very respectable 45h score in our dedicated battery test. This means you'll have to charge the smartphone every 45 hours if you do an hour of calling, video watching and web browsing per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Butterfly battery test scorecard</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Class-leading 1080p display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now come to the star of the show. The 5" 1080p screen is probably the main reason you are looking at the HTC Butterfly and the third generation Super LCD won't let you down. The 441 ppi pixel density means you won't be able to discern individual pixels even if you press the screen against your nose, but that's by far not all the display has going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly LCD also offers great contrast and nicely saturated colors, to go with its extremely wide viewing angles. The viewing angles, together with the high resolution make everything appear as if painted on the screen - an effect we really appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see in the table below, the screen is pretty bright as well. The blacks aren't as deep as those of the AMOLEDs out there, but still great in LCD terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have a photo of the HTC Butterfly display as seen by our digital microscope. The pixels are the same size as on the Xperia Z, but even here you can see how much "livelier" they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is not exactly perfect, but is good enough to not cause any usability issues.

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Butterfly screen is the pinnacle of mobile display evolution so far, but it still leaves some room for improvement. LG and Samsung would really need to came close to perfection to beat that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean takes over, Sense gets a minor update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Buttefly runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and features the updated version 4+ of the HTC Sense UI. Unfortunately, once you turn on the Buttefly you'll have to dig deep to find the new Jelly Bean goodies. For the most part, Project Butter's optimizations and Google Now are all that remind you what version of the OS you are currently running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance, Sense has remained unchanged since the Jelly Bean update, but it's not quite so. For one, there are minor color swaps in various places (the volume slider is now light blue instead of green), the task manager app has been revamped, and some apps like the flashlight are slightly changed, but nothing too drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video which highlights the most significant modifications:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is famous for its deep customizations to the interface of the host OS and the latest version of Sense is no exception. Despite Sense 4+ being almost the same as the 4.0 version, it runs a lot smoother because of Project Butter, due in large part to the consistent 60fps of all UI animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen remains unchanged - by default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom, all of which are customizable, but there's a catch - in order to change the apps that display on the lockscreen you need to manually change them from the homescreen dock. This can be inconvenient as you may want different docked homescreen apps and lockscreen shortcuts, and other manufacturers like LG offer this option, which is preferable. Otherwise you drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone just like before, or to any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC Butterfly comes with nine different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu - a photo album, Friend Stream, Weather, Clock, Stocks, Productivity, People, Music or just a plain wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Productivity lockscreen lists the latest missed calls, texts, emails and scheduled events. People lets you pick a group form your phonebook and a rectangular grid of their contact images will pop up on the lockscreen. Grab one of them and drop them on the ring to view their details. You can have more than one page of contacts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music gives you a mini music player on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is still here - tap the home key (while on the default homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out (with an awesome animation) to display the thumbnails of all homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes. A small house icon indicates the default homescreen, which cannot be changed, although its order can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have as many as seven homescreens - and with the ample set of preloaded widgets (as well as the huge variety available at the Play store), you might want to keep all of them. In case you don't - you can delete the unneeded ones right from the Leap view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize button is absent from the dock since Ice Cream Sandwich, but you can still find all of its functionality in the Settings or use the dedicated app within the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary Scenes function is an essential part of Personalize - essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a stock ticker, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course, and you can download and assign new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you use your Butterfly as both work and personal phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of horizontal pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't use them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in similar fashion to ICS and is one of the less successful changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not thrilled with the widgets themselves. While HTC has done a great job making them stand out in both looks and functionality, it doesn't make sense for a widget do take up an entire homescreen panel on the Butterfly's big and pixel-dense screen. The fact that most Sense widgets cannot be resized adds to the problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step-the old method of picking a widget and then picking the size (if any) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on. The Remove option does as advertised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area gives you a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is just one toggle here which is new to the notification area - the Power Saver on/off switch. It does exactly what it's supposed to do - toggles the power saving mode or (if you tap on its name) takes you to the Power Saver options. If the phone detects headphones it will also display the Beats Audio on/off switch in the notification area. The notification area is also available in the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has remodeled the app switching interface - screenshots are displayed of the running apps, turned slightly to the side. They're ordered horizontally (instead of vertically as is the ICS standard) and you can swipe up to remove them. The not so-good news is that you can only see three of them at a time, even in landscape mode - a waste of screen estate. There's also no way to close all apps with one button, unlike on recent builds by Sony, Samsung, LG and others, which let you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the slightly revamped task manager too. The only change is in the UI itself while functionality remains the same. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>We stress test the four Krait cores<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly runs one of the top setups among flagship droids - a Qualcomm S4 Pro chip with four Krait cores clocked at 1.5 GHz, 2 gigs of RAM and the Adreno 320 graphics processor. In other words it matches the Nexus 4, Xperia Z, Oppo Find 5, and DROID DNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Initially, we were really impressed by the Oppo Find 5, until the Xperia Z managed to blow it out of the water. So the HTC Butterfly has a tall task entering the competition. Unfortunately, Quadrant and GLBenchmark reported errors and were taken out of the running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start you off with BenchmarkPi which tests calculations per core. In theory the Krait cores are the best in the business right now (until those Cortex-A15s start flaunting their stuff in a few months) and should post impressive scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly was 2 points short of a record here - but that one belongs to the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack also tests calculations per second, but unlike the single-thread-focused BenchmarkPi, it tests multi-threaded performance. Here, the Butterfly was second only to the Xperia Z, again. But only just.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark which means it tests just about everything it can. Here the Butterfly didn't post an impressive result. It's lower than the significantly underpowered One X+.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We land on the first real GPU-based benchmark Epic Citadel. It's based on the Unreal engine and really stresses the graphics chip to its limit. Here, the Butterfly managed to match the current champion Sony Xperia Z, which is normal considering that both devices run on the same GPU. At 55.6 frames per second average you can bet that things run as smooth as silk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another compound benchmark, Geekbench 2, lets us see how the most powerful droids compare to Apple's finest. The HTC Butterfly was slightly behind the Xperia Z and way in front of the iPhone 5 and slightly in front the likes of the Optimus G and Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to JavaScript performance it's no secret that manufacturers tend to "coach" their devices to perform better. Here the Butterfly was second to last, beating only the Xperia Z which also got a horrid result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On BrowserMark 2, however, the HTC flagship managed to beat everyone else, except for the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally Vellamo, which like BrowserMark 2 is primarily HTML5-based, showed the HTC Butterfly as an above average contender - although not the best.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the HTC Butterfly to rip the competition apart and perform among the lines of the Xperia Z. And the results did not disappoint for the most part, save for the unfortunate lack of GLBenchmark and Quadrant scores. However the Sony flagship was able to ultimately notch the victory in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should point out that Sense UI is among the heaviest launchers available and at times the phone struggles to perform glitch-free. That being said, Project Butter has really improved navigation and animations are smooth throughout the OS, with any stutter associated with Sense only just noticeable. Pages load quickly, graphics are stellar, placing and removing widgets is done in a heartbeat and no matter how many apps are running, the HTC Butterfly doesn't seem to ever deplete its available RAM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now helps a lot even when you don't actually use it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we've said, Google Now is one of the most notable new features that the Jelly Bean update brings. In the simplest of terms, it is Android's version of Siri for iOS, but more integrated into the operating system. Google Now is way quicker than its competitor at recognizing and answering your queries and while its functionality still leaves something to be desired, it seems like a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the HTC Butterfly gets activated with a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly has HTC's all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly held on to signal even in tight spots and the in-call quality was clear and exceptionally loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the Butterfly displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default, which is a pity, given that you get a front-facing camera. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi or 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker of the HTC Butterfly scored a Good mark - combined with a strong vibration, you shouldn't miss any calls. You can read more about the loudspeaker test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Butterfly are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Gtalk, which can connect you to Google's chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. "drx" matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Butterfly boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard is great - the 5" screen has enough real estate for large, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC Butterfly lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly uses the in-house HTC gallery, which got a new version within Jelly Bean. When you open the Gallery you can now choose which photos to view - on your phone, Facebook, Dropbox, SkyDrive, Picasa or Flickr. Wherever you choose you'll get to a familiar screen - stacks of photos arranged by albums. There is a dropdown menu where you can sort the photos by Events a.k.a. the date they were taken. The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also opt to hide specific folders (for instance a folder dedicated to Album art), so that they don't get in the way of your picture browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. Some photos have an icon indicating it's not a single photo but a burst shot instead. You can later go back and pick the one to be used as a thumbnail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'd need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too. Another thing we admire about the HTC gallery is that it displays photos in full resolution, which we believe is a must on a 1080p display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We preloaded the Butterfly with an SD card full of hundreds of high resolution images, which took a bit to all load the first time around, but after that things were all smooth sailing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC Butterfly is built into the Gallery app - there's no dedicated shortcut inside the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface has a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos. Overall the included options are more than enough and they are all implemented in a nice out-of-the-way manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support on the video side is very good - all popular video codecs are onboard and videos run at up to 1080p resolution without a hitch save for a couple of dodgy DivX videos we had on tap (others of the same codec played just fine). However audio performance wasn't as trouble-free. The Butterfly managed to open and play almost every video we threw at it, but two videos came out mute. The first uses the AC3 audio codec which is known to choke many smartphones, but is pretty widely used. The other relies on the MPEG audio 1 and 2 codecs, which pretty rare so not as big a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio or No effects. Beats is enabled only through a headphones set and improves the sound experience significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available and you can manually pick a subtitle file - the only requirement is the subtitle files must be in the video folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too - the Butterfly can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV via the 'Select player' option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a large high-res screen like that the HTC Butterfly makes for a great portable video player - The 1080p clips look downright amazing on the beast and it has enough battery backup for most long travels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats, little else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap the ellipsis to automatically fetch album art for a track or look it up on Google or YouTube. From the Menu you get a Select player option, which is how you can play the song on a DLNA-enabled sound system or over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly has the Beats Audio moniker stamped on the back, which means your sound is enhanced to boost the sonic experience - you can use it with any headset you want. The problem is that enabling and disabling the Beats option is just about the only thing you can do to enhance your sound experience. We would have liked to be able to set our own equalizer settings or at the very least been able to choose from a few presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can drag this card into the ring to unlock the phone and go straight to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here, however, not is there a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go with TuneIn Radio. It relies on your internet connection and can play just about every station on the planet that's gone broadband (let's face it, most of them are). And the quality is arguably even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set stations as favorites, search local stations by country or genre, and the app will even list you results to specific artist, album or song searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you can also set your alarm to wake you up with your favorite station. Keep in mind that you need an active connection for this and it does tend to take the life out of your battery fast in the morning.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Exceptional audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly really aced our audio quality test, showing nicely clean output and garnishing it with way above average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone did great in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels higher than all of its competitors and close to that of the Apple iPad 4 tablet, which is the loudest device we have tested recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises, but that's the only affected reading. Volume levels remain at the same high level, too. This is one of the first occasions when HTC has really made the Beats audio logo stand for something other than a simple equalizer, but the wait was probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP stills hasn't moved forward<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels in 4:3 mode and 3264x1840 ones in 16:9. The HTC Butterfly can also capture 6 MP 16:9 images during video recording. It's also capable of 1080p and 720p videos @ 30fps. There's an LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, or HTC ImageSense, is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo taken. On the left is the flash setting toggle, a front camera switch, general settings and shot mode (we'll get back to that in a moment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the shutter key. To record video you tap the button below - and you can still tap the shutter key to snap a full-res photo, even while recording video. Another cool option is the burst mode, which we mentioned in the gallery - you press and hold on the shutter key and it will snap multiple photos and let you pick which one to keep (you can keep all of them of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the camera app UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is pretty cool, but we had one problem with this combined interface - if you want full 8MP resolution still shots, you have to disable the Widescreen option. But then it becomes hard to frame a 16:9 video in the 4:3 view finder. That's made even worse when shooting 720p video. The field of view in that mode is narrower than what the viewfinder shows and framing involves a lot of guesswork. We hoped the Jelly Bean update would fix these problems, but that is not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the Butterfly with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group portrait is quite cool - we've seen something like it before in the Scalado Rewind. It snaps multiple photos and for each face (and the Butterfly can track many faces), the phone automatically picks the one where that person is smiling and didn't blink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Butterfly features a camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip, just like the HTC One X, so understandably the image quality of the photos produced with the two isn't all that different. The lens is a 28mm unit meaning it's wide and lets you squeeze more into the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detail levels are only average and colors were off more often than not. Noise levels are also above average and while contrast is good, dynamic range fails to impress. It's not bad overall, but some way off the best 8MP shooters out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped an HDR sample with the Butterfly and saw that the smartphone tends to try and squeeze a bit too much dynamic range into the photo, resulting in flat-looking image. If you like the exaggerated HDR effect, you are free to disagree with us here, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as macro goes the HTC Butterfly isn't the most impressive device around. It doesn't let you get too close to the subject and results were generally unimpressive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording is only okay<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly records 1080p and 720p videos at 30fps and it can snap photos simultaneously. You can also use touch focus and even toggle the video light - and that's during recording!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two 6 MP images we snapped during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see the S4 Pro chipset play a bigger role here and let users snap video at 60 fps like on some rival smartphones, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos come out with a lowly bitrate of just under 10 Mpbs. Framerate circles the 29 fps mark and audio is recorded in stereo at a bitrate of 94 Kbps and a 48 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for quality itself it's obvious that compression takes its toll on the fine detail. Colors are pleasing and the videos generally look punchy, but their dynamic range is pretty limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus works like a charm and the Butterfly is fast to start recording and can even snap a few full-resolution 16:9 photos along the way. While it isn't the best smartphone camcorder around, it's also not bad and can step in for your point and shoot if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p sample taken off the device itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Worry-free connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly packs quad-band GSM and dual or quad-band 3G (depending on region) to go with its market-dependent LTE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the Butterfly with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is present too. We found it to work hassle free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microSD card slot inside the Butterfly and the device supports up to 32 gigs of expanded storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the fullHD resolution of the display, watching on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like Sony, HTC have a propriety app that can help you transfer precious information like photos, contacts, messages, and more from your previous smartphone to the HTC Butterfly. HTC Transfer gives you wide selection of smartphones to choose from.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Even better Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Butterfly comes with the latest version of the Android web browser. Coupled with the fullHD display and powerful processing power inside, the Jelly Bean web browser performs without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has also thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen, which seemed to pop up when you scroll back to the top of a page, which was getting a bit annoying at times. You see sometimes those buttons appeared along with the top bar, whereas on other occasions they remained hidden when the top bar was showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from being way too big, those mysteriously behaving buttons let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly lacks Adobe Flash support so inline non-HTML5 videos are a no-go and so are gaming websites like Kongregate and Miniclip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always sideload Flash from an .APK if you're dead set on having Flash capabilities, but there are no guarantees on how well it will work, or if at all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly features the usual set of organizer applications. Office document viewing is done through the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock (also part of the Clock app) is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's SPen - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is HTC Tasks app as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another HTC exclusive app you get is a very basic Movie Editor, which can be used for trimming videos among other things. Flashlight has seen a slight revamp in the UI, but provides the same basic functionality. It still allows three levels of brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a voice recorder on the HTC Butterfly too. It's a pretty straightforward app with a nice interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the Yahoo! Weather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, audio and video players, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC scenes, HTC wallpapers, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off no less). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.). You can also go with HTC's Location app, which lets you navigate offline and download a handful of language packages and maps by region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One month of voice guidance will set you back 9.99 EUR, while a year or unlimited cost 39.99 and 49.99 EUR, respectively, which is a bit on the salty side.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Butterfly leaves no doubt about how important it is to HTC to reclaim lost ground in the smartphone game. The device is good-looking, blazing fast, and has the best display in the business bar none. Those are the right boxes to tick if you're after impulsive buyers and power users alike, and the Butterfly has enough to keep you interested well past the introductory phase of your relationship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved display is a real usability boost, and most welcome too in a 5-incher. The HTC Butterfly also delivers on the social networking end, with Sense UI offering probably the best integration of various image-sharing and media-streaming options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, mentioning Sense UI, we cannot overlook the fact that it's not able to keep up with the impressive hardware. The lack of shortcuts in the notification area is a glaring omission and the launcher generally doesn't offer as big a set of exclusive features as its main competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stuff like smart stay/wise screen or split screen multitasking might not be game changers, but they are genuinely useful features that make a difference to the user experience and HTC has nothing to offer in response. We would also have appreciated more advanced equalizer options (especially given the previous partnership with Beats audio) and an up to date task manager, but that's nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, none of these issues is big enough to weigh against the fact that the HTC Butterfly is the most complete smartphone package currently available on the market. Besides, more than a few dozen custom launchers are available in the Google Play store and many of them will easily address most of the Sense UI's deficiencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you value direct functionality and media consumption, you'd certainly be tempted to pick the HTC Butterfly over the Sony Xperia Z if the two are priced equally. That's an achievement in its own right, but it's based on a couple of assumptions that might prevent yet another HTC flagship from fulfilling its potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest issue the Butterfly has is no fault of the smartphone itself, but rather how you would go about getting your hands on one. The smartphone is only officially sold in a few Asian markets and Russia, while Europe is left waiting for the arrival of the HTC One, and the US is stuck with the DROID DNA, which offers laughably low non-expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Importing one is always an option, but both compatibility with local networks and the resulting higher price make it one most will likely frown at. Another trump that the Xperia Z holds is its IP57 dust and waterproof certification, which might be enough to tip the scales over the Butterfly even if the latter is available where you live.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another direct rival to the Butterfly is the Oppo Find 5, which comes closer to matching the brilliant display of the HTC flagship. The budding Chinese manufacturer hit the ground running and produced a smartphone that can easily trade blows with the big boys, and while the Find 5 doesn't really offer much over the Butterfly, it matches it or comes pretty close all over the field, which combined with the attractive pricing make it the better value-for-money offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is the Find 5 is even harder to get than the Butterfly, and even though global release plans have been confirmed, it might take too long to still be relevant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the 5" 1080p invasion continues, last season's chart-toppers are steadily sinking into oblivion. The jump from 720p to 1080p might not be as big as the one from WVGA to 720p, but the overall user experience has moved forward nevertheless, making the Galaxy S III, the HTC One X and the LG Optimus G no longer in the conversation as have-it-all-alternatives. They can be had at a bargain price though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? HTC One X ? LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems then that the HTC Butterfly is a well though-out product that could have easily been a must-have during the first half of the year. However, with the new One (formerly known as M7) just around the corner, it seems that HTC were only using the Butterfly as a demonstration of power, and will instead focus all efforts on its successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might explain the minor software gaps on the Butterfly - the company just saw it as an interim step rather than the ultimate goal. And that might be as good indication as any - if a player that good sits on the bench, imagine how great the star striker will be. What's important for HTC is that a flap of the wing may've put the wind right in their sail.</paragraph>
