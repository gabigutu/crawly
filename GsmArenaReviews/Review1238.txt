			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Someone at LG must have thought: "Leather is so last-year, let?s do something nobody has done ? or long quit trying." And here we have the LG G5. It has the looks of a brand new flagship, the heart of a dragon and an adventurous dual camera setup suited for every occasion. But there?s more than what meets the eye, the Magic Slot. The LG G5 is a modular smartphone, which lets you plug a handful of external add-ons: a semi-pro camera grip with shutter buttons and a bigger battery, or an external sound amplifier by B&amp;O.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>How long since you last saw the inside of your phone? It seems like while everyone was busy experimenting with designs and mixing up various alloys, there was something unusual cooking in the LG labs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brand new or just well forgotten old, innovating for its own sake or trying to defy the impossible, the modular design won't let you upgrade the processor or the camera, but it certainly offers plenty of options. The add-ons will mostly be sold separately but initial prices don't seem too bad. You might even get a bonus camera grip - LG will throw one in the bundle in select markets. Who knows, we might see the return of the xenon flash or some smart docking solutions along the lines of Microsoft's Continuum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you do get right out of the box is the base equipment and in the case of the G5, it's anything but modest. Perhaps the star of the show is the camera combo. The 16MP camera borrowed from the LG V10 does top-notch stills, and the secondary 8MP sensor offers unmatched super wide shots while adding a hybrid zoom of sorts to the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's check out all the LG G5's features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the first thing that got scrapped right at the drawing board must've been water proofing. If it ever was on the cards to begin with - after all, LG isn't known for water-tight flagships, is it? Anyway, the Magic Slot pushed it off the agenda altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Magic Slot itself, what good it is to you depends on how much you're willing to spend on add-ons. Even if it's only for the access to the battery, it's good enough by our books. Yet, we can see how some users may be alienated by the idea of detachable bits exposing the innards. Habit is a big thing and the industry has gone a long way now in exactly the opposite direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal chassis, on the other hand, stands in the way of wireless charging - but probably hasn't ruled it out entirely. It may as well be another use of the Magic Slot down the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 has lost its signature rear volume keys, which is easily explained by the already busy rear panel. Thankfully, the fingerprint scanner/power key is still around, right below the camera module.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Care to learn more? Our detailed hardware overview kicks off right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G5 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 stands at 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7mm, not as wide as the LG G4 and about the same height and weight at 159g. The smaller footprint is down to the slightly smaller screen with a 5.3" diagonal, down from 5.5".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 takes a break from the familiar G-series design, losing the signature rear deck with lock and volume keys and returning back to the rounded elegant shape. We like what LG has done with the G5 - the metal shell suits the flagship, while the front 3D Arc Glass is unlike anything we've seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass spreads across the entire front of the device and is flat throughout except at the top where it curves towards the metal frame. It's quite subtle yet makes for a great effect regardless of the angle at which you are examining the G5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chassis is carved out of metal, and even though it looks like it's made of two separate pieces, it isn't. The reason for the illusion is the chamfered edge separating the back from the framing. The edge is painted in silver and is quite sharp to the touch - enough to feel it, but not as much of course as to cause pain or discomfort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module bulges quite a bit, which depending on personal preference, can be an interesting accent or an eyesore. Either way, you should at least appreciate that it houses two camera lenses, the LED flash, and the laser autofocus system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the black deck is a circular fingerprint scanner, doubling as power button. Since it looks like a touch key/fingerprint sensor combo that we've seen on many phones by Chinese brands, you may be surprised that it's actually a button that you can press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping out the original battery from the Magic Slot is quite easy and you can insert whatever new accessory you have. It does power off your G5, there's no way around it. Good thing is the G5 is one of the quickest phones to boot, which limits the waiting after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is also made of metal and fits nicely into the ensemble. It fits nice and snugly without any wobbling and the whole thing feels as solid as if it was a non-removable part of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is a flagship smartphone and you can tell it right away. Its handling is great, with one of the most secure grips we've experienced thanks to the choice of materials, design changes, and the overall shape. The chamfered edges may feel odd at first (the antenna lines being quite sharp), but we got used to it rather quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the G5 is compact enough, and pocketable. It's smooth to the touch and easy to operate with one hand. The Magic Slot release mechanism is secure, and you can't unlatch it by accident (if only it wasn't for the gap it would be perfect). We found the G5 more than likable regardless of whether you intend to use the modular feature or not. It's comfortable to hold, well built, and pleasant to the touch. That's easily the majority of checkboxes ticked on your flagship check list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG G5 has the earpiece on the curved forehead, alongside an 8MP front facer, a couple of sensors and a status LED. The Optimus launcher lets you customize the notification LED, and you can configure it to flash in different colors depending on the type of notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magic Slot ejector and volume rocker are now on the left, while the right side of the G5 has the dual tray that holds the nanoSIM and microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G5 puts the audio jack, the IR blaster, and the second mic on top; while the USB Type-C port, the primary mic, and the loudspeaker grille are over the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new camera setup is on the back - a 16MP 16:9 sensor with laser-assisted AF, accompanied by the laser and color spectrum sensors, a LED flash, and the secondary wide-angle 8MP FF camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the chin with the Magic Slot requires you to push the release button on the left. If you have an add-on, you just need to insert it, and turn the phone back on. The mechanism is very sturdy and won't detach on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two official Magic Slot add-ons at launch. The first one is the LG Cam Plus camera grip. It adds extra 1,200mAh of battery capacity, and hardware camera controls: shutter key, a camcorder button, camera on/off button and a zoom dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&amp;O PLAY with Bang &amp; Olufsen DAC for enhanced audio quality. LG has confirmed opening the standard to third-party manufacturers to create even more add-ons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 has screen similar to the one used on the V10, but smaller. It's a 5.3" Quantum IPS LCD unit of Quad HD resolution, which sums up in 554ppi screen density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the LG G5 has an impressively high contrast ratio (1885:1) due to its especially deep blacks (deep for an LCD anyway). However, the maximum brightness is surprisingly low at 306nits. It's a good thing that at least in auto brightness mode, the phone is able to push it up to 378nits in response to bright ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To help things even further, LG G5 comes with something called Assertive Display algorithm for adjusting pixel color values in real time on GPU level in bright sunlight. The technology helps sunlight legibility not by making the screen brighter, but by processing darker parts of the images on screen to make them easier to read by brightening them up selectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other end of the spectrum, the LG G5 screen offers a rather low minimum brightness level of only 3.6nits (just like LG G4 and V10), which means it will go quite easy on the eyes when you use the phone in pitch dark settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding color accuracy, the screen is similar to the V10's - it has an average deltaE of 5.4, which isn't perfect but is above average regarding accuracy. LG hasn't provided any ways for you to adjust the screen color temperature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our outdoor visibility tests, the LG G5 screen offers well above average legibility at max brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 has all the connectivity goodies. It comes in GSM and CDMA flavors (the latter will happily work on GSM networks if the bands match up). There is a dual-SIM version on sale, too. The fastest mobile data option is 450Mbps LTE Cat.9 and you get 42Mbps on 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G5 supports GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, and BDS. It also comes with a new Low Power Location Estimation (LPLE) Technology, which helps for very low power consumption for location-based services. In theory, LPLE should be up to 40% more power efficient than its preceding location-based tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding close-range connectivity, the situation is pretty solid with Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac bearing most of the load with Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA add-ons. For low-power connectivity there's Bluetooth 4.2 LE with the apt-X audio codec. The G5 has a new 24-bit Hi-Fi Wireless Audio (aptX HD), an enhanced audio codec, which streams 24-bit CD-like sound over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is on-board so the G5 is compatible with Android Pay. You get the benefit of fingerprint security too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired USB Type-C port handles PC connection, USB OTG (via an adapter, sold separately), and it allows you to use the G5 as power bank and charge another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side you get a DLNA server support and Miracast, plus a number of LG-specific features. One is SmartShare Beam (transferring files between LG devices) and LG AirDrive, which does the same but with a computer (you need an LG account).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is powered by a 2,800 mAh battery, and the good news is you can easily swap batteries via the Magic Slot. If you have opted for the Camera Plus accessory, your total battery capacity will be 4,000 mAh. We did our test with the regular pre-installed battery, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is quick to charge thanks to the latest Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 tech - with the right charger the phone's battery will fill up about 80% in just 30 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 did relatively well in our test with an endurance rating of 60 hours - that's the amount of time the G5 would last on a single charge if you use it for an hour of 3G calls, an hour of web browsing, and an hour of video playback each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Always On display feature was always going to be a battery drainer, no two ways about it. LG's claim that it would cost you 0.8% per hour seems about right. Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which we carried out with the AOD off and then once again with AOD on. These results are not featured in our test scorecard but are calculated in the total rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning on the AOD does have a noticeable impact on the overall endurance rating as it drops down to 50 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out the LG G5 manages better the always-on feature than the Galaxy S7 duo and managed to beat the Galaxy S7. Note that the G5 always-on screen goes dark if you put it in your pocket, which will add additional hours to the final rating. In our tests the always-on screen was, well, always on, so you can compare the results to the Galaxy S7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the individual tests, the G5 did well with 3G talks and video playback, outed an average result on standby, and performed uninspiringly when it comes to web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest G-series flagship has a tradition of bringing a new version of the LG UX, and we are up to v5.0 with the G5. It's built on top of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and brings new features as well as a cleaner look to get closer to the Material Design aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen supports notifications and shortcuts, as usual. To unlock the phone, you can use double tap or LG's more secure Knock Code. For those unfamiliar, it is essentially a secret knock pattern shared between you and your phone. We doubt that you would need to resort to knocking (or rather tapping) when you have a fingerprint reader at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader is the most secure option. Since it's on the Power key, all you have to do is tap on it - the sensor is always on, and it works lightning fast. Your index finger (on either hand) naturally rests on the Power button, making this solution comfortably ambidextrous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G5 offers an Always-on screen as has become trendy recently. When the phone's screen is off, a portion of it still remains lit-up to display the time and notifications. Having to rely on an LCD panel where you can't simply light up only a portion of the screen, LG has come up with a rather unorthodox solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apparently, the main 5.3-inch display has a second controller included, that only has power over a limited number of pixels on the screen. They are intended to stay lit up with a date and time, as well as notifications. You can also swap the clock for a lot less useful signature if that is your desire (you still get the notification row). Of course, the whole thing is intended to be power efficient and LG claims that the small secondary screen mode eats through 0.8% of battery per hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Always On display visualisations are fairly customizable and it support themes. The G5 has only the default LG theme, but you can get more from LG's SmartWorld Store. One proprietary customization feature lets you add extra on-screen buttons (up to 5) - one to launch Capture+, QSlide, or open the notification area (if you don't fancy reaching for the top edge).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens are the usual affair - they support shortcuts and widgets, you can change wallpapers and effects, and you can opt for the Smart Bulletin homescreen. The latter offers at a glance info from LG Health, upcoming calendar events, music controls, IR remotes, and Smart settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer this time around - everything is put on the homescreens. You can organize your apps in folders, you can even hide some of them if you don't want them to be visible all the time. You can opt for a different Home Mode though - Home with App Drawer, which will bring back the app drawer. Easy Mode is available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has got better as well - it has one row to show the time and edit options, the next one the quick toggles, then optionally a row of brightness slider, another optional row with volume scrubbers, and the final optional row has Screen Sharing and File Sharing shortcuts. Two of those are active by default, but luckily, you can hide all that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher uses the familiar 3D card setup and supports app pinning. There is no Dual Window option. But you can use the Qslide option - a selection of floating, resizable apps that float above the main app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG offers lots of useful management apps for storage, memory cleanup, battery saving, backup. Multi-user support is available, too. There is a Recently Uninstalled Apps app, which keeps track of all apps you've removed recently for a limited time (24 hours), in case you (or your kid) has deleted any by accident.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of kids, the option for multi-user access has been carried over from previous devices and you can easily create a more limited account for your children or friends or siblings who perhaps borrow your phone from time to time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the new Optimus 5.0, as it is organized better, got rid of some functionality, but kept its most important services. The result is an interface closer to its Android roots, yet recognizable and powerful.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G5 is powered by the most recent Qualcomm chipset - the Snapdragon 820 - and the chip maker promises up to 2x higher performance than the Snapdragon 810. The 820 SoC has a quad-core Kryo processor (2x 2.15GHz, 2x 1.6GHz) by a new custom proprietary design plus an Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance is where the Kryo CPU shines. It did better than any other Android competitor, including the Galaxy S7 Exynos's Mongoose core, and it indeed doubled the performance of its predecessor (the Cortex-A57 within the Meizu Pro 5). The Kryo is just short of Apple's Twister core, the best performer on the market right now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core performance is better than the Snapdragon 810 chips (Nexus 6P) and matches the Exynos 7420 octa-core processor inside the Galaxy S6 edge+ and Meizu Pro 5. It is also far ahead of what LG G3 and G4 could offer. The latest Exynos models of the Galaxy S7 series are doing better than the Snapdragon 820 chip, though, but don't forget they have additional four Cortex-A53 cores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 6 is a compound test that gauges CPU, GPU, RAM, and UX multi-tasking capabilities. The LG G5 aced the test and edged the Galaxy S7. Don't forget the AnTuTu benchmark has an onscreen 3D test which runs at Quad HD resolution on the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7 while the Xiaomi Mi 5 has it on a 1080p display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark OS II 2.0 is another compound test, which in addition to CPU, GPU, RAM, and OS, also takes into consideration the browser performance. The LG G5 did great here, on par with the Galaxy S7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's check the graphics out. The offscreen GFX Benchmark 3.0 and 3.1 Manhattan tests put the Adreno 530 (Mi 5) on par with the Mali-T880MP12 (Galaxy S7) and it's twice as good as the GPU inside the Galaxy S6 series.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quad HD resolution of the LG G5 takes its toll on the onscreen tests and halves the scores compared to the 1080p Xiaomi Mi 5, which has the same GPU. Still, you can consider these scores as flagship-grade nevertheless.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BaseMark X test outed a rather unimpressive score if we are to compare it with others, but the Quad HD resolution may have been in play here, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 performance is flagship-grade, capable of handling anything anytime, and it doesn't heat the shell much. We ran lots of benchmarks, one after another, and the G5 chassis did get warm, but far from hot. Unfortunately, we noticed some minor GPU throttling in the GPU benchmarks once the G5 gets warm, but nothing you could notice in real life. Oddly, the pre-production unit we had was cooler than the retail one and did not throttle at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The telephony features are combined into a single app that uses tabs to separate features (you can hide the tabs you don't need). The tabs are pretty self-explanatory: Call logs, Contacts, Favorites and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Ringtone ID is on board. This feature composes a unique ringtone for each of your contacts, turning phone number digits into notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker proved to be good - even better, with certain ringtones it was downright loud. Additionally, the speaker sound quality is among the best we've heard to date, with very rich and clear output. Even though the speaker is just one, it seems to be capable of dispersing the sound wider than most of the phones we usually encounter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 brings a capable Gallery app, which compliments its serious camera department. Its UI has been refined since the last time we saw it, but hasn't changed the logic of operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memories feature automatically organizes photos by location and time, or you can view the images by Album or as a Timeline (by Day, Moth, Year and with pinch zoom to help you navigate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA is built into the app, so you can send photos to a compatible TV or pull them from a storage device or computer. Then there's the cloud connectivity - Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, and OneDrive are supported, though not Facebook or Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo editing is done via the Google Photos app and you get an Auto enhance button, basic color correction and cropping.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the gallery, the music player features DLNA and cloud integration making it easy to sync your music collection. And the LG G5 will take anything you throw at it - lossless FLAC and ALAC files as well as MP3s. Hi-Fi 24-bit sound is supported, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app comes with a number of equalizer presets, including one dedicated to the Quad Beats headset you receive in the retail box. Hitting the Custom option gives you a manual 7-band equalizer to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time you plug in a pair of headphones, the phone will tell you about the 32-bit DAC. Enabling it gives you the precise volume control as well as dials to change the left/right balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 has built-in FM radio, and as usual, you have to plug in a pair of headphones, which serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player on the LG G5, you have to go through the gallery. The good news is that its DLNA capabilities come in handy if you have your videos stored on a compatible device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated video player supports all common video and audio codecs, and can display any kind of subtitles. You can also manually load subtitles and customize their look (size and style).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is decently clean, not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 delivered perfectly clean output in the first part of our audio test. When used with an active external amplifier, the flagship easily achieves top marks for clarity, which is about what you?d expect from a decent phone in 2016. The volume levels are slightly lower than average though, which puts the G5 at somewhat of a disadvantage over its direct rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo crosstalk rose quite a bit when we hooked up our standard headphones, but at least none of the other readings were affected so the performance here is once again par for the course. Loudness remained unchanged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the G5 won?t disappoint the audiophiles, but it isn?t quite the best in terms of audio output either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 04 April: Plugging the B&amp;O DAC brings the LG G5 to a higher level in terms of audio output. When used with an external amplifier the output is just as clear as before but the loudness is now just above average. And headphones only cause a minor hike in stereo crosstalk with other readings remaining unaffected - a really solid performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is shaping up as a major selling point for the LG G5, just like it was for the G4. It has inherited all the camera goodies of its predecessor such as the Laser Auto Focus, the Advanced OIS and the Color Spectrum sensor from its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the new flagship now comes with a dual shooter setup on the back. You can capture the scene with either a 135-degree Ultra-Wide Angle camera or with a more conventional 75-degree field of view camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra spatial awareness comes courtesy of an additional 8MP shooter on the back. It sits alongside the 16MP F/1.8 camera, which looks to be identical to the one on the LG V10 back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side, the phone is not only smart enough to quickly let you choose between shooters depending on how wide a view you want to fit inside the frame, but it can also leverage the two cameras to produce various shot effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 camera naturally offers panoramic shots, manual controls, HDR, facial recognition, among other mandatory features for a flagship camera. The really impressive capabilities come from the additional shooting modes, which combine the two cameras - the Pop-out picture, and Multi-view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop-out Picture is quite self-explanatory - it combines the picture of both cameras, but the image from the main 16MP snapper pops out at the center. You can apply four different effects for the pop-out mode - fisheye, B&amp;W, vignette, and lens blur. You can have more than one of those active at the same time, offering lots of creative freedom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-view setup allows for simultaneous shooting with two or all three cameras simultaneously - both videos and picture. You can choose the layout of the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the two snappers is easy - there are two dedicated shortcuts at the top of the viewfinder. By the way, you can choose the layout of the viewfinder as well - there is a simple one with just the shutter keys, auto - the one we are used to, and manual with extensive list of controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the dual-camera setup has successfully allowed LG to make the G5 stand out. The Pop-out and Multi-view samples allow for quite a few creative uses, but having a wide-angle camera which can snap a panoramic shot in an instant is very cool among all others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP snapper is 135-degree wide, which is so wide that in the beginning we used to capture our own fingers in the ultra-wide photos. The focus on this one is fixed and while image quality is nothing spectacular, once you downsize these photos for social networks or desktop wallpapers they look quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see the field of view difference between the two snappers here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of wide shots we made for you. They offer uninspiring level of detail, but very good contrast and colors, plus, the dynamic range is definitely among its pros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's talk about the main 16MP camera. The image quality is very close to what we saw from the LG V10, and quite impressive. The produced photos are rich in detail, with little noise to get in the way but come out with strong, artificial sharpening. The noise reduction can be too aggressive on some spots though, while it's helpless in other areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors are fairly accurate, the contrast is very good, as is the dynamic range. While it's no HDR, it manages to capture more than enough detail in the shadows, while keeping the highlights in check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode (on, or auto) can be of great help - it rescues the highlights and also opens up the shadow detail. It boosts the sharpening, however, creating small halos or visible fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few samples of LG G5's HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode stitches images perfectly and creates an image just over 5,000px tall. The final image is as sharp as a single photo, though an Apple-like HDR mode for the panorama would have been helpful. Even without it, the dynamic range should be good enough for most shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP selfie snapper does the job - it resolves enough detail, the contrast, and the colors are good. You can use the screen as a flash, which is nice. The pictures are perfect for social sharing, and we could not want anything more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie snapper supports Auto Shot, which automatically takes a picture when your face becomes still - you don't need to do anything - just smile and the phone will take the best picture for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is more than capable of pulling its own weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see it puts up an excellent fight against the other snappers we've tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 camera tops out at 4K @ 30fps video. There's no 1080p @ 60fps, while for slow motion you get 720p @ 120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos have 48Mbps total bitrate. They are as smooth as 30fps videos can be and the image quality is excellent - plenty of detail, low noise. The colors are identical to the still photo camera, as is the dynamic range, white balance, and contrast. Overall - the 4K video samples taken with the LG G5 are among the better ones we've seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K samples taken with the 8MP FF wide-angle camera came with a good amount of detail, lively colors, and good contrast. You can check both 4K video samples from the playlist below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are shot at 17Mbps and the quality is great. At this resolution, you get the option to enable digital image stabilization, the Steady mode. However, this will shrink the field of view noticeably. But if you really need wide FOV, then just switch to the other camera - its samples are equally great though not as sharp towards the corners. Watch both samples from the playlist below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of resolution and camera, the audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps. While we would have appreciated a higher bitrate, the mics are very good and you can hear even the most delicate details in the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a couple of Pop-out videos in case you are interested. They offer four effects - black and white, lens blur, vignette, and fisheye, and you can combine those whatever you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical image stabilization does an okay job of smoothing out camera shake, but it can't correct the stronger jerks. The digital stabilization may well be worth it as it produces much smoother videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the untouched video samples - 4K at 30fps (10s, 56MB), 1080p at 30fps (11s, 23MB), 4K wide at 30fps (9s, 54MB), and 1080p wide at 30 fps (9s, 20MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compare the 2160p and the 1080p video camera quality with other smartphones if you like. The LG G5 seems to be doing great in our Video Comparisons Tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG kept the app package of the G5 trim and tidy. Evernote comes preinstalled to help you sync and organize your notes or you could just use QMemo+. That one also does syncing (memos go into Google Drive). QMemo+ gives you basic text formatting, the ability to create checkbox lists and draw on top of the text. While drawing with your finger, you can use two fingers to scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app features Event pocket. It simplifies the event creation process down to drag and drop. You can drag anything from Facebook events through nearby locations to To-Do lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Health counts your steps and shows your progress towards your daily goal. It will even rank you against other users to motivate you to push further. The updated Health app now supports Beginner and Advanced modes, and will motivate your throughout your day to achieve your goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QRemote app works with TVs, set top boxes and air conditioners. What we love about LG's app is that it lets you build a universal remote by picking buttons from various remotes for individual devices and assembling a super-remote. This lets you easily have buttons to control the TV and AV receiver from the same screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable File manager that can easily move files between local memory (internal storage, microSD or USB storage) and the cloud. You can ZIP-up files, which will make them easier to send.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG backup serves double duty. It can copy your stuff off your old phone or push things from the G5 to another phone. It also does backup and restore. You can store the backup file locally or upload it to the LG Cloud. For extra privacy you can lock the file with a password.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G5 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build quality and handling. Photos don't quite do the handset justice but, yes, it isn't a stunner like the iPhone or the new Galaxy S7. The Magic Slot mechanism is straightforward to use and secure enough. Even if you don't end up using any of the add-ons, the option to replace the battery is welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is very good. Although its maximum (user controlled) brightness is about 300nits, the contrast is excellent and the sunlight legibility is solid. The minimum brightness is superb for night reading, the blacks are deep enough, and the viewing angles are decent. The color accuracy rendition could have been better though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is average at 60 hours - the option to always have a spare ready to take over is most welcome. The always-on screen battery management is better than on the Galaxy S7, but the customization options are limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Marshmallow with Optimus UX is a powerful combo. LG has done well to keep the bloatware in check, but left enough in terms of customization options and proprietary services to enhance your Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 820 chipset offers stellar performance. It runs cool and doesn't seem to be plagued by thermal throttling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is excellent with an external amplifier, though cross-talk spikes on headphones. The volume levels are about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera photos are great, with plenty of resolved detail, high dynamic range, excellent colors and contrast. We like the 16:9 sensor better than any 4:3. The wide-angle camera allows instant panoramic shots and opens up the door for some nice creative usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos are great with plenty of detail, as are the 1080p samples. The OIS, and the digital stabilization, can save the day quite often.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is a most unusual phone - too bad you wouldn't know it at the very first glance. We've been sort of circumspect over the course of this review, but it's time to put it bluntly. The LG G5 may as well turn out to be the flagship with the least exciting design of the season. It's refined, but it lacks character. It comes with quite a lot of hardware innovations and yet it looks trite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funny actually, an LG G4 owner who loved the leather finish might find it hard to fall for the successor. These two phones are so different on the outside that they may have as well been made by different companies. We'd guess, it?s a part of the deal you know, the twist ending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's face it. This is and isn't a phone like most of them. A Quad HD screen, Snapdragon 820, the latest Android and a fingerprint scanner meet the minimum requirements for membership in the elite club. This is where the story ends for some flagships. The LG G5's is just about starting to get interesting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snap it on, plug it in - if you're keen on getting the most out of your phone, the LG G5 is better at it than any other. The question is who would do that when the majority of people don't seem to mind the fact that the most they'll ever get to put inside a phone is a tiny sim card. We just don't get to tear our phones apart anymore, like we used to when it all started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Laziness, habit, call it what you will, but this is where the industry's been heading for a while now with unibody designs. If LG can turn it around it would be a massive feat. In fairness though, it will take a lot more add-ons and probably successive (and successful!) generations of phones to build on the concept. And, most of all, users willing to make the extra effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, yes, the Magic Slot is a true headline-grabber but the modular concept alone may not be enough to even the odds for LG. The good thing is it doesn't cost extra to have this technology at your disposal. If you're not too keen on tinkering with it, you can at least benefit from some extra peace of mind by carrying a spare battery in your pocket. And you're still getting one of the top performers of the season. Those are two perks that few flagship owners can enjoy simultaneously these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual camera setup on the back is what you can actually use every day on a variety of occasions. A super wide-angle backup to an already impressive imager is a great asset opening plenty of new creative possibilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the LG G5 is hardly the most attractive flagship out there but we were impressed with the excellent build and handling. There's an excellent screen, an amazing camera and a feature-rich software package. The battery life is acceptable even if average, and the swappable battery definitely compensates for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 is perhaps more attractive and even water-proof, but some may consider its 4:3 12MP camera as a downgrade. TouchWiz isn't everyone's cup of tea either, and the sealed battery may limit some of few despite the otherwise excellent battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 5 is cheaper, but better looking and at least equally capable, though it can't match the camera and the memory expansion. The Mi 5 is also offered in just few markets, but if you are among the lucky ones, the omissions may as well be worth the price gap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If water-proofing is a must, the Sony Xperia X Performance is a good candidate to consider. Despite its awkward name, the X Performance is very capable, it offers a top-notch camera, and a 5" 1080p display. Many value Sony for its tight integration with other consumer devices and the clean Xperia interface, so you should check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 6s Plus is more expensive, and inferior in all but design and performance. The Lumia 950 XL has the beauty of AMOLED and power of Windows 10 and Continuum, plus it costs cheaper, but everything else is lesser. Still, if either iOS, or Windows, are a must for you, go grab one of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu Pro 5 and Huawei Mate 8 are both exquisite flagship phablets made of metal, packing powerful processors, capable cameras, and rich software suites. If you are into the phablets, each of those fellas cost about ?150 less than the G5 and are worthy of considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is as good as any current flagship at a time when flagships are inevitably more and more alike as makers wouldn't risk falling behind. It's hard not to appreciate LG for making the less obvious choice - probably knowing that there are easier, more obvious choices a user can make. Failure to monetize innovation certainly hurts but failure to innovate can kill you.</paragraph>
