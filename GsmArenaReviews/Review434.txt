			<paragraph>This is the first Nokia phone with swivel design. Moreover, this is a phone that comes as a part of a special fashion line of Nokia models, called L'Amour. It is all covered with flowers and has plenty of innovations: impressive QVGA resolution, active stand-by display, "clouds" interface, appropriate synchronization order...There is no doubt that Nokia 7370 will whirl up the market, especially considering the fact that it stands on the basis of the luxury Nokia 8800!</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia first released its stylish collection L'Amour in October last year. It was such an important event that our team immediately set off in direction to Nokia's central offices to see live the flower children of the master artist. Three mobile phones were presented to us: the 7360 model with classic construction, the 7380 bar and the swivel 7370 model, which I am holding in my hand at the moment. However, my head is full of memories of the luxury 8800 model, made of matt steel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, no, it is not a quiz of the "which mobile does not fit" type. The reason I have placed no other mobile but the luxury Nokia 8800 right next to Nokia 7370 is going to become clear in the course of this review. When my colleague Marek Lutonský was showing the Nokia 7380 bar, that is also part of the L'Amour line, to his friends, he would always face astonishment provoked by the artistic aspect of a device that was originally meant to serve as a mobile phone. Even if the rotating 7370 model is not as expensive as the luxurious 8800 above, it attracts at least as many sights and as much attention as Nokia 7380.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 7370 in our pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A beginning actor, a draughtswoman, a painter, an infinite number of musicians and a dancer would one after another try to steal Nokia 7370 from my hands. Eventually I was convinced that this mobile is made to comfort artistic souls. But you can imagine what was my surprise when certain friends of mine who were far away from art also expressed high interest in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 7370 in my hand&nbsp;Size comparison with a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the phone is 88 mm long, with the other two dimensions being 43 and 23 mm, which puts it among small phones. Its weight of 104 gm ranks it as a medium heavy phone. Nokia 7370 is offered in two color versions: one with amber golden covers made for feminine customers and a coffee brown one, which is supposed to suit men's expectations for an extravagant phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First Nokia with swivel construction!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is the first Nokia made mobile phone with swivel construction. Nevertheless, the manufacturer has mastered it brilliantly for a first try. Nokia 7370 is perfectly solid. The upper part moves smoothly. The device opens both ways without problems. Be sure to close it in the same direction, in which you opened it, though. A similar solution can be observed in several Sony Ericsson models, the W900 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   When opened</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will need practice, handle ability and perhaps even a little bit of sharp eye to rotate the upper part of Nokia 7370. Closing it is even a greater challenge, especially if you do not help with your other hand... There is an option inside the phone's menu for adjusting the behavior of the phone to the activity of the swivel. You can set the device to accept calls when its upper part is opened and terminate calls when it is closed; or neither of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   An all-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire surface around the display is decorated with golden flowers. They draw more or less attention according to the type of light that falls on them. The uneven surface also makes them blend together. Similar ornaments cover the rear side of the display too, but there the decoration is silver, instead of golden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia 7370 is full of golden elements...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>... and silver flowers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover and the SIM card bed are supposed to imitate hard leather - an aim that has evidently succeeded, knowing the fact that the plates are in plastic. The camera lens looks old-fashioned. What's worse, Nokia's designers has repeated the mistake they made in the 6111 model , as they have placed the camera lens exactly where user's pointing finger lies, when they hold the phone with their right hand. Where has the cap disappeared?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Loosing the back cover ? battery ? and the SIM card bed under it ? inconvenient location of the camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the sides of Nokia 7370 you will find the volume swing button and the camera release button. Here you will also run into the main switch on/off button, which is so small that it made me lose my nerves. The accessories connector is a standard Pop-Port. Next to it you will see the slot for the narrow charge connector. Up right a fabric label is to be found, but surprisingly, it does not say "Nokia". I myself appreciate this element of modern stylish phones a lot, because it somehow smoothes the overall technical strictness of the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There's got to be something more than the phone, right ?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before I turn my attention to Nokia 7370's keypad and display, I would like to write a few words about the fashionable accessories, which are part of this phone's original package. In a nicely decorated box (which would have suited the phone more in its entire stylish concept if it had been made sheer metal) you will find a fabric case with well creased flowers. The inside of the case is made of orange suede; on its outside you will see a fabric label identical to the one we see on the phone. The case is closed by an eyelet and a kinkle. Nokia 7370 holds firmly in the case, whose twine lock did not get loose even once during the testing period. What's more, the inside suede material makes the phone look shinier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabric case with well creased flowers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cherry on the top of kitsch however is the lively drop to be attached to the eyelet of the phone. It is a golden fringe with a tiny head, which strongly resembles the type of decoration our grandmothers used to hang on their wardrobes. I myself would rather leave this accessory at home, but I can imagine how a lady with sharp forepart shoes and fur around her neck will go crazy about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you wear this?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stereo speakers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When Nokia 7370 is closed it is almost unusable. The only functions available are: adjustment of the volume level, activation of the camera application, taking a picture, changing the activated profile by pressing the main switch on/off button, and a complete switch-off of the entire device. And that's it, nothing more. So, let's swivel. When the upper part of Nokia 7370 rotates, the display rotates too. It has a proper page orientation even when the phone is on a stand-by mode. The only detail I consider as a drawback here is the small size of the time and date info bar and the incoming message icon, which are quite difficult to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display rotates together with phone's upper part</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 can be setup to play a relevant sound when opening and closing it, different for each direction. The image rotation is fast and thus has no impact on the speed of phone's applications. You may have to wait for approximately a second if an active theme with animation is used, but that's all. When you open the phone, below its curve you will see two thick silver grids that cover the speakers. The phone is equipped with stereo speakers. In addition, the menu offers an option called "Stereo extension", which does make a difference - it opens the space and significantly improves the sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;One grid on each side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo widening</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing is modified through the use of special profiles. Nokia 7370 offers 5 ringing profiles, which imply melody changes, sound alerts as well as profile's expiry time settings. The phone plays 64 voices, but I suppose you would rather go for a MP3 file of your own for both calls and incoming messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is made of gentle creamy plastics. The main control button is surrounded by a golden frame. The central confirm key is in orange. All four ways of the control button are large and comfortable. In order to maintain the elegancy of the design the manufacturer has ignored standard green and red colors and has elaborated the receivers in the creamy color, typical for the entire device. They do not swell out even when backlighted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keypad details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "5" and "8" numeric keys are slightly raised up. You can see it in the pictures above, but your thumb will hardly recognize the difference. Having in mind the fact that the most serious inconvenience of all phones with standard distribution of alpha-numeric keys is the hard-to-access location of the bottom part of the keypad, Nokia 7370's ergonomics and keypad functioning are worthy of compliment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad backlighting</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Active stand-by display is no more a privilege of smartphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370's display is a top-class one. A decisive quality factor here is the resolution of 240 x 320 pixels distributed on a surface of 31 x 41 mm. Icons are extremely fine; background and font are depicted to the very detail. The grid pattern is invisible to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu interface is an improved version of S40 (Series 40). This is why it may happen that the stand-by display welcomes you with either wallpaper, or the so called "active stand-by display". The latter appeared for the first time in a phone without an OS in Nokia 6111. However, it started to catch up with active stand-by displays of smart phones with the Nokia 7370.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Active stand-by display ? browsing inside its options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by display shows all urgent events, so you no longer have to check your calendar daily. Dates can be searched straight from the stand-by mode. In its upper part you will see tiny icons, which take you to selected menu items. You can organize these icons according to your will or even replace the top banner with a completely different option. Nokia 7370 offers a total number of four fields, a music player, a FM radio, a counting indicator, and the above mentioned calendar notes, as well as standard network cell and battery indicators. The space reserved for all this information can also be left unused. To sum up, Nokia does deserve a compliment for equipping a common phone with an active stand-by display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left context key has a standard function - it opens the "Go to" option, but it can also be assigned to any of the menu items. All four ways of the control button are adjustable too. Nevertheless, I would recommend you to reserve both the up and down options, or at least one of them, for accessing the active stand-by display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting functions of the context key ? option "Go to" ? setting up the keys for accessing the active stand-by display ? control key options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I like the idea of inserting variety of font colors to be used, when the phone is in a stand-by mode, because it's sure that white will always be visible on dark wallpaper... However, it's a pity, that this improvement is not possible to apply in the entire menu. In the majority of cases, a color theme with dark wallpaper goes together with menu interface with dark color nuance too. I was disappointed to find that a stylish phone like Nokia 7370 has a single color theme, which corresponds to phone's flower patterns and tunes with its entire outlook. The alternative option is a standard blue theme, used in all common "boring" mobiles, which I consider absolutely inappropriate. All menu items can be marked and relocated. When an icon is selected, it gets wrapped up in green and can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Relocating folders in the menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu's view options have been extended too. Apart from the standard matrix with legends and the common vertical list with items, Nokia 7370 offers a function called "Tabs" where items are in the top banner with their content displayed below. Besides, you can set up this banner in a way that a "details list", a "simple list" or a "pattern" appear in the subfolders, all that separately from the rest of the menu. As a result, if you enter the Gallery, for example, you can work in an interface, different from the Applications one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Moz(ne' viza'z(e nabi'dky:&nbsp;Different menu interfaces: Grid with labels ? without labels ? tabs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Independent outlooks of other levels: Details list ? simple lists ? basic pattern</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370's phonebook offers several view alternatives. The main one is a standard enlarged font. Contacts saved on the SIM card and those kept in the memory of the phone can be displayed all together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Phonebook ? searching ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The content of the phonebook can be displayed in three modes: by "names list", "name and number" and "name and image". All 8 numeric keys can be assigned to a shortcut option. The phonebook is searched by gradual entering of the letters of the relevant name. Besides, you can organize it into groups, labeled with specific pictures and ringing tones. Both a distinctive picture and a distinctive ringtone can also be assigned to each name. Name contacts fit in 23 different fields: various types of numbers, a street and a web address, e-mail, a note and even a self-made video record, which appears on the display when the relevant person calls you. The only field I miss here is birth date that would get automatically copied into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Inserting new contact info</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has finally improved one important feature of its phonebook, its order option. Since the first Nokia mobile phone that offered synchronization with PC up to now all Nokia's phonebooks (beside smartphones and communicators) have been ordered by first name only. In Nokia 7370, however, you have a choice: either by first name, or by last name. Once again, applause!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker independent voice dialing, is another useful innovation in all mobiles of the L'Amour line. It is reliable as Nokia 7370 keeps a memorized combination of sounds and is thus able to read any word. Problems could occur only in case that the dialed name is much too complicated or unusual. Anyway, people with names like Novák, Lutonský or Polesný should not have any fears. Menu items can be voice-opened as well. For example, I used voice to switch between different profiles - I would press-hold the right context key and pronounce "Silent" or "Outdoor" etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Anything that you might miss so far?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 manages standard SMS, MMS and instant messages. It is able to send a pure sound record of duration of maximum 3 minutes. The message editor is organized very well. Just like in the phonebook, its graphic design is based on new "clouds" and is really attractive. The first Nokia model to have this type of graphic organization was the above mentioned Nokia 6111, but its small display made fields look somewhat robust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This type of interface organization comes in quite handy for "the clouds" fit to the size of the text written in them. Nokia 7370 offers three font size options: big, standard and very small. The latter, by the way, is fully efficient, thanks to the outstanding qualities of the display, and allows simultaneous viewing of 11 lines when messages are written or read. The message editor counts from the first written character on, up to an overall amount of 913 characters. Messages can be portioned into 6 parts. The length of the written message has no impact on the speed of the editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Messages editor offers three font size options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 is equipped with T9 dictionary, which offers both standard writing and automatic word prediction. It is practical and helpful. Both prediction and learning new words are fast. You may also want to ignore T9 and write without using its help. It is possible. Here are some other options provided by the message editor: SMS previews, fast inserting of contacts, jumps to first or last field (most to be used in MMS creation), and complete field remove.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A MMS can comprise of texts, pictures, and sound or video clips, as well as a calendar note and a business card. The maximum size available for a MMS is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Creating MMS</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Day after day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370's calendar is extensive and exhaustive. It offers a month, a week and a day view. Events are memorized together with all relevant details. Records memory is shared. There are 5 kinds of events available: conference, phone call, birthday, note and alert. Whether weeks will start on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, is a matter of user's choice</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Calendar and its views: month ? week ? day</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;New entry ? entry details </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the available amount of 160 characters is too limited for you, you may want to use the built-in separate notebook, which is larger, offering as many as 3000 characters. If you set it up, Nokia 7370 will not only alert you about urgent events, but will also repeat the alert in a day, a week, in 14 days, in a month, or in a year. Alert repetition of birth dates is automatically setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-do list in Nokia 7370 is good. It provides three levels of task importance and marks off tasks that have been accomplished. In addition, task records can be ordered by entry types. Classifying by importance is missing. All task record can be copied into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;To-do list ? Task details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although Nokia 7370 is a mobile phone, its calculator is more than good. For example, you can set up your own exchange rates and indexes, manage goniometrical functions, or switch between radians and degrees. You can make early mornings more pleasant if you substitute standard alarm sounds with a MP3 file or radio broadcasting. Snooze intervals can be customized. The same also works for repetition and days of the week. The last time-organizing function offered by this new L'Amour jewel is the stopwatch including intermediate time, lap time, and a minute counter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Don't count on MP3, listen to radio instead<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A message for all music fans: you'd better take your hands away from Nokia 7370. It has no memory card slot, which is a very serious drawback. At the same time, I think that a cool phone like Nokia 7370 deserves a proper full-function music player. Instead, it has been equipped with 12.5 MB of user memory and a music player of the "yes, I would support MP3, but that's all" type. So it seems that in Nokia 7370 you will find neither equalizer, nor scrolling info about files and artists. All it offers is an icon and the name of the relevant file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Included earphones with Pop-Port can also be used as a handsfree set</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio built in Nokia 7370 may partly be considered a substitute for the insufficient music player. The radio plays in both mono and stereo modes. It searches stations automatically and does it well. It also provides memory for saving up to 20 different stations. As expected, the radio only works if a handsfree set (the included earphones) is plugged into the phone. The cable of the earphones serves as an antenna, which is visible on the active stand-by display while the music player or the radio is running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Built-in radio</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Average camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 has a built-in camera with 1.3 megapixel resolution. At the beginning I was wondering how important the lack of a memory card slot would be...Well, I did not have to wonder a lot... The camera shoots in a maximum resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels, with lower picture sizes of 800 x 600, VGA, QVGA and 160 x 120 pixels being available as well. There are three possible quality settings for JPEG files and a single option of 176 x 144 pixels for 3GP video records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you take pictures with Nokia 7370, you will need to hold it horizontally, no matter if open or closed. Besides, image rotates so fast that you will not even manage to note the exact moment of change. The camera is equipped with a digital 6x zoom, which is controlled through the use of the volume control buttons. The digital zoom provides crops only. There is no built in flash light. The night mode features increased noise levels. Similar to all photo mobiles, Nokia 7370 captures images in night mode extremely slowly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 is held horizontally, like a standard digital camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Pictures interface ? display during video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7370 takes pictures of rather poor quality. It sublimates and provides no exposure compensation. White balance option is not available either. Fields of similar colors merge one into another, just like if a Photoshop effect was applied on them. This, of course, affects the sharpness of the final picture. It was more or less at that moment of testing when I suddenly stopped missing the memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Applying "crop" zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pictures taken with Nokia 7370(displayed in full resolution when clicked on)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Modifying pictures in the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone reads WAP contents quite fast thanks to EDGE Class 10. If you happen to know the addresses of the text versions of the web pages you want to see, Nokia 7370 will be able to open them too. The phone does not seem to experience difficulties with color pictures in this aspect, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Entering a web address ? website text version</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Games for Java 2.0 version can be downloaded from WAP or PC via Bluetooth. Alternatively, you can kill time with the only game pre-installed on Nokia 7370. It is however so hardware-intensive that it turns eventually into a kind of a slideshow. Beside this game, the phone offers other useful applications: an extensive stylish-look measure converter, fully corresponding to the overall design of the L'Amour line, and world time clock. I had quite a lot of fun with the new application, which converts cloths and shoes sizes. Would you like to find out what size you would wear in Osaka?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Built-in game is practically impossible to play ? an interesting cloth-and-shoes size converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;World time ? Selection of major cities?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Measure converter ? list of categories</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It was worth the effort<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is quite clear that for many customers the 7370 model of the L'Amour line will be nothing else but a vain try from Nokia to launch another phone of extravagant outlook that has one or two insignificant additional functions. But they will be absolutely wrong. This flower child is equipped so well that it stands on the basis of the luxury giant Nokia 8800, whose starting price is 830 euros. At the same time, Nokia 7370 hit the market at a price of 370 euros. Not to mention the fact, that Nokia 7370 provokes far more excitement and interest than the most expensive current serial Nokia model. If you want to draw attention to Nokia 8800, you will need to tell everybody around how much money you spent on it. In comparison, Nokia 7370 is naturally beautiful (for all those attracted to its particular style, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I would like to congratulate the manufacturer for its brilliant work on the first Nokia swivel mobile phone, for the excellent design of Nokia 7370's display and the ergonomy of its keypad, as well as for its useful active stand-by display, which used to be once a privilege of smartphones only. I already expressed my satisfaction from the option of ordering the phonebook by first and last name. I also like the accessories included with the device in the original delivery package. On the other hand, I really regret the absence of Infrared port and the lack of a memory card slot. As I said before, Nokia 7370 has no real music player. As to the pictures it takes, they are much too poor to be worth printing and better be left on the display.</paragraph>
