			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's impressive tablet lineup is already in its second generation, but the one that stands out is surprisingly at the lower end of both the size range and the age bracket. The ultra-thin and incredibly light Super-AMOLED-packing Galaxy Tab 7.7 may as well be the one the iPads should be afraid of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the tablets on the market are powered by dual-core chipsets, and the new Galaxy Tab 7.7 will have no trouble blending in. Scratch that. Some of its peers may find it hard to keep up. Sure, it will soon be looking at some quad-core slates fast approaching in the rear view mirror, but that time is yet to come. The Exynos SoC with those twin 1.4GHz cores is more than sufficient for a 7-inch device by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes the Galaxy Tab 7.7 so special is the screen and the compact form factor. This is the first and only tablet to use a Super AMOLED Plus display and - you don't have to take our word - it looks gorgeous. Equally, if not more importantly, this is the only tablet to feature a 7.7" screen. So, is it Samsung's insistence on finding an empty niche where no one else in their right mind will care to look or is the Galaxy Tab 7.7 really that special?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a lot of ground to cover before we can give a definitive answer. But honestly, we can see why people looking for a genuinely compact and portable tablet with premium specs would go with the latter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being one of the best looking tablets, much of which comes down to the Super AMOLED Plus screen, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 manages to get the rest right too. The Exynos chipset, the rich connectivity, the solid battery backup and the multimedia skills round off an impressive package. The voice call support is a major boost too - the ultra-portable tablet saves you from carrying an extra phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, it's the compact size above all else that make the Galaxy Tab 7.7 a worthy option to consider by those who find the iPads and other 10-inchers too much of a hassle to carry around. Of course, the iPad 3 and some of the most recent 10" droid slates have raised the bar too high in terms of screen resolution, but the Galaxy Tab 7.7 isn't so desperately behind in actual pixel density and the AMOLED screen still has an edge outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot going on for the Galaxy Tab 7.7. There're some question marks hanging over it too, which we'll try to address. Coming up next is the hardware inspection and that's good news for this here slate. It's highly unlikely to start on the wrong foot as long as we're talking Super AMOLED Plus and brushed aluminum. Shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Exploring the Galaxy Tab 7.7 retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 comes in a paperboard box that's barely wider than the tablet itself. It holds the charger, a USB cable and a 3.5mm in-ear headset with integrated microphone, call and volume controls. There is also a pack of extra ear buds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the only 7.7" tablet in the world doesn't have to try hard to stand out, does it? Well, actually size alone won't help you spot it in a bunch of seven-inchers. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 is barely bigger than any of the 7" Samsung slates and almost the same size as the BlackBerry Playbook - only much slimmer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the second generation of Samsung Galaxy tablets is doing the Galaxy Tab 7.7 a favor by bringing only minor changes to the uniform design. It's a nice position to be in - we're looking at a tablet that's, in more than one way, one of a kind. Slim profile, brushed aluminum finish and Super AMOLED Plus, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is one of the sexiest tablets around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yet, despite all the superlatives it deserves, the design won't be the Galaxy Tab 7.7 key selling point. That role is most certainly reserved for its 7.7" Super AMOLED Plus screen of WXGA resolution (1280 x 800 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing special about the resolution and some 7" tablets like the Huawei MediPad and the Toshiba Thrive 7 even push the pixel density above 200 ppi. If you did the math already, you'd know the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is close behind at 196 ppi. The Retina display of the new iPad is the standard-setter in tablets at 264 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if the spectacular image quality of Super AMOLED Plus displays is a must, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 has no alternatives. Except this little gem  here  we stumbled upon at the MWC. But well, we're yet to hear anything about the timeframe, let alone an expected release date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no need really to go at lengths about the image quality of the AMOLED screen. The deep blacks, infinite contrast, color saturation and outdoor visibility are giving LCD screens something to aspire to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 are impressive, with almost no loss of color unless the screen is viewed at extreme angles. No other tablet screen can even come close to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, some tablets have zoomed ahead on resolution and 1080p screens are no longer a thing of the future. The new iPad's Retina display was a real eye-opener and the likes of the 10" Huawei MediaPad and some of the Asus Transformers are not far behind. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 will have to admit defeat or take the fight outside. That's where the Super AMOLED Plus is certainly in its element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2048 x 1536 screen of the new iPad is beautifully, remarkably crisp. It's the sharpest you can get on a tablet - and likely to stay so for a while - but its outdoor performance is average at best and that's a major disappointment for a display of such quality. The Super AMOLED Plus screen of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is incomparably better outdoors. This may not be such a big deal if you tend to mostly use your tablet inside. But the Tab 7.7 makes a case for itself as the compact and portable alternative. Nothing could've given it a bigger boost than an AMOLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7, just like the rest of the Android gang, has very few hardware controls. With all the navigation done on the screen itself, there's no need for hardware buttons on the front panel. All you get there is the earpiece and the video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and the Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is designed with portrait use in mind. When you hold it that way the earpiece goes on top where it belongs, while the Samsung logo can be read without tilting your head. Of course four-way screen rotation lets you use the tablet however you like, but portrait seems to be the default orientation. The downside is you don't have a choice if you want to use the original Samsung Keyboard Dock. The charging/docking port is on a short side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo speakers are at the bottom, which isn't the best possible placement either. The other things to note there are the mouthpiece and the Samsung proprietary port that's used for charging, computer connections and providing HD TV-out. Both the TV-out and USB host features require adapters to work and they are not part of the standard package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another microphone pinhole and a 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Galaxy Tab 7.7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment, both sealed with plastic lids. The memory card slot lets you expand the inbuilt memory by up to 32GB making the cheapest 16GB version of the device a perfectly viable option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 has only two hardware keys - the volume rocker and the power/lock key. Samsung have decided to get rid of the Infrared port, which we saw in our preview unit. The Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus has an infrared port and the Peel Smart Remote app preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We complete our hardware inspection at the back where we find the lens of the 3.15 MP 720p-video-enabled camera. Tablets are hardly the most comfortable devices for taking pictures (even relatively compact ones like the Galaxy Tab 7.7) so the camera is more of an accessory than an essential feature. That's why we've no reason to frown at the specs - it's as good as most users will need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is powered by a 5100 mAh battery which, coupled with the power-efficient AMOLED screen, is more than enough to make the Galaxy Tab 7.7 one of the best tablets in terms of battery backup. In our battery test the Galaxy Tab 7.7 achieved a score of 80 hours. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 80 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7 is impeccably built and the finish does well to set it apart from the rest of the Samsung tablets. And you really have hold it in your hand to appreciate how slim and lightweight this slate is. Portability is a key selling point of the Tab 7.7 but good looks and premium feel were not overlooked. The aluminum finish and the only AMOLED screen in business give it all the exclusivity it needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Honeycomb soon do be Ice Creamed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 is running Android 3.2 Honeycomb, but the Ice Cream Sandwich update is in the works already. It is skinned with the proprietary TouchWiz UI like all the Samsung tablets. The TouchWiz additions are nice, but you shouldn't expect changes to run as deep as on the company's smartphones. These are just some custom touches to help the Galaxy Tab 7.7 stand out in the Honeycomb crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin here is a video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are most probably familiar with this version of Honeycomb, which we last saw in action on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. We are going to explore it one more (and probably last) time anyway. Ice Cream Sandwich brings minor interface changes such as redesigned settings menu and homescreen options, along with performance optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designed from the ground up for tablet use, the Honeycomb interface gets rid of the typical Android controls we've seen in smartphones. The navigation keys are in the bottom left corner of the homescreen: Back, Home and Task switcher (plus a screenshot key courtesy of TouchWiz). The search shortcut is in the top left, the app drawer in the top right and finally, but certainly not least importantly, the notification area with quick toggles in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar at the bottom is no longer static. A tap on the arrow flips it to its side to reveal eight shortcuts. Clicking on any of them opens a widget that you are free to move around the screen. It stays on top of everything until you close it or you open its full-screen app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the taskbar-docked shortcuts called mini-apps are proprietary Samsung stuff. They include the in-house task manager, phone and messaging widgets, world clock and the PenMemo app, as well as a calendar, calculator and a music player. Most of the functionality is overlapping anyway so you might not need to go there too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has the connectivity toggles that we've come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock Honeycomb quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu. The rest of the toggles are Notifications, Sound, Auto-rotation and Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons in the bottom left corner also have a new addition. We don't know how many people other than reviewers and developers will find the new screenshot button useful, but it doesn't hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the other buttons has remained unchanged - Back, Home and Task Switcher is what you get with stock Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app drawer and homescreen edit buttons stay in the top right. In-between is the final change brought by Samsung - the dots indicating the number of available homescreen panes and the current selection (and they are clickable for quick navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen no modifications at all, but there are plenty of preinstalled apps that cannot be found on other tablets - Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office, Video player and My files. Some of the other apps like the music player and the calendar have been modified as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the traditional Android benchmarks on the Galaxy Tab 7.7 (Exynos, dual-core Cortex-A9 1.4GHz, Mali-400MP GPU). Obviously, processing power is the last thing to worry about in this tablet - it has the most powerful CPU clock of all Samsung tablets to date. You can rest assured you'll be getting all the performance you need. There are few dual core droids that can outdo the Tab 7.7 in some tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Useful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the needed clicks for some tasks and thus improve usability. Samsung also changed some plain Honeycomb icons with TouchWiz ones, but nothing beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on the top right corner as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options - edit contact, import/export, join with another contact, send or print a namecard, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done via a popup window, where you the available fields organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn't existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren't available at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - for every contact you get two tabs - the standard Info one we already talked about and History. The latter shows all the latest activity with this contact (emails, messages, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice and video telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 had great in-call quality and reception. Wherever you use a headset or the embedded earpiece the sound is crisp and loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available - all you need to do is press the virtual button at the bottom at the top left corner of the homescreen and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter" or "text Dexter").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging app layout is similar with the phonebook - on the left you get contacts, on the right are the conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically transformed into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Email and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7 comes with two optimized email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and one to use with any POP3/IMAP account (incl. Gmail).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's basically the same treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few further optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won't notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the keyboard is too big for you, there is a dedicated virtual key on its top left, which will shrink it a bit. The keys become smaller and thinner, giving you even more working space. It's still comfy enough to type and we actually like this design better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on key presses. There's haptic feedback too - the slate vibrates exactly where you've tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more option - Swype - which comes preinstalled with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. If you're used to Swype, there's a chance you'll be even faster on the big screen. You can enable Swype in the Settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A gallery we love<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7 gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality, but it has too been tweaked to feel more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds the sorting options, shortcuts to the camera, image details or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit - the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 gallery shows the images in full resolution so you can see the finest available detail in your images. If you want to zoom precisely to 100% just use the double tap gesture. If you feel like it you can zoom in even further - up to 200%, though we can't quite see why you would need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more fancy way to zoom in and out, but we are not sure if it is quite handy. Just put your thumbs (any two fingers will do - it's just that it only feels natural with thumbs) on a picture and tilt the tablet up or down and the photo will start zooming in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer-based trick is available here too - in the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player does fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have blessed the Galaxy Tab 7.7 music player with the familiar TouchWiz custom interface, which we find more functional than the stock Android one, even if it lacks the cover-flow-like browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, folders, composer or year. Playlists are here too and there are automatically generated most played and recently added lists. Naturally, there's also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) the interface splits into three screens - the filters on the left, the album in the middle and the now playing track on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the song name brings you to a dedicated now playing screen where you have a repeat (one or all) and shuffle options as well as a setting to add the currently playing track to favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers are available too, along with various sound effects like concert hall, music clarity etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name along with the usual music shortcuts (something missing on the Honeycomb 3.1 version on the bigger Galaxy Tabs). There is also an option to shut down the music player directly from this menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The awesome video player returns<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android Honeycomb doesn't have a dedicated video player app but Samsung always provides one of their own for the Galaxy Tabs and so it made its way to the Tab 7.7. Allowing for thumbnail, list and folder view modes, it's a pretty functional application. There's also searching so even if you fill that ample storage with short clips you should be able to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7 supports DivX/XviD/MKV files out of the box. Performance with higher-res videos is great - it played ALL videos up to 1080p (including) like a champ - smoothly and hassle-free. Subtitles are also available and there is rich encoding support. We really tried to find something the Tab 7.7 won't play, but without success. It seems Samsung has put support for every common audio and video codec making the Tab 7.7 a real monster when it comes to video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few full-screen options too - normal, fill and stretch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung slates are traditionally quite good in our audio quality test and the Galaxy Tab 7.7 Plus is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 gets amazing scores all over and if it wasn't for its uninspiring volume levels it would have been really perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output is still impressively clean for the most part. The stereo crosstalk spiked noticeably and some intermodulation distortion creeped in, but none of those should cause too much concern. Sadly, volume levels are only average again, so the Tab 7.7 can't be recommended as the best out there. It's still an excellent audio player, though, so unless you absolutely need the bragging rights, you'd do fine with this one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3MP worth of pictures, pleasant HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3.15 megapixel main camera capable of doing 720p videos and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera (with VGA video) is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. Given tablets aren't the most photography-friendly devices, it's probably as much as you are going to need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the two cameras are mostly there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy S II with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples to show you the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 camera. We found it to be pretty good for the 3 megapixel league - low noise, enough detail, accurate colors and good balance between contrast and dynamic range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the 3 megapixel camera on Galaxy Tab 7.7 does a splendid job, but that's understandable - you have much more room and processing power here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different, really. There are fewer options available here, but the layout is basically the same. The Galaxy Tab is capable of recording 720p videos at 30fps. There is a chance the video recording might be bumped up to 1080p when the Ice Cream Sandwich update kicks in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos are top-notch with stereo audio recording, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There's plenty of information too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Galaxy Tab 7.7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 is a match to most of the HD capable flagships and tablets and our video compare tools is here to prove it. Of course, there are a few 1080p capable camcorders using the same hardware so there is room for improvement. Once again we'd suspect that the more demanding Honeycomb was the reason why 1080p is absent here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-bundled connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 is well equipped in terms of connectivity. There is a proprietary 30-pin USB connector for computer connection, but there is no USB charging (though some users suggest the USB charging actually works, but due to the low USB power output, the Android OS is not indicating it as charging).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get quad-band GSM radios plus 3G speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. It is GPS equipped as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well. The 16/32/64GB of internal storage helps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that (the original connectivity kit with 2 adapters - SD reader and USB port - costs $25). Using one you can connect card readers, USB flash drives and other compatible devices to your tablet and access their contents through the file manager. Mice and keyboards are supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy a separate HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no infrared port and no NFC connectivity on the Galaxy Tab 7.7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web-browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. There is full Flash 11 support and tabbed browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Galaxy Tab 7.7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own screen with a split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There's also a most visited and today tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn't need any extra software - you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also auto-complete for forms and passwords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance - the Galaxy Tab 7.7 does great at 360p, 480p and 720p videos right in the browser. Flash games go well too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7, including the Polaris Office that can both view and edit documents. It has really nice user interface with 3D arcs for the recent docs, internal file browser, intuitive interface, etc. It supports both internal and web storage (via Box.net).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing word documents, spreadsheets and Power Point files is hassle-free. There's a PDF reader in the bundle as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizer features on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that comes to mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is optimized for big-screen use and is pretty intuitive. You can naturally set as many alarms as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc. Once you try it, you'll definitely like it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a few apps provided by Samsung for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 worth mentioning - eBook, Memo, My files, Pen memo and Photo editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader is quite capable - it allows you to highlight or underline text, change the font size and page color, search the book and place bookmarks. There is even text-to-speech feature with settings for speed and pitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo is pretty simple notes application with interesting interface - you get your notes as sticky note on a wooden board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Files is a familiar app - it's the Samsung powerful file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pen memo does almost the same as the memos, but in addition to the text it allows you to draw pictures and offers some extra options such as colors, background, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Photo Editor offers some basic picture edition tools - selections, rotate, resize, crop, color effects and adjustments, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a video editor app as well. It covers all the basics - trimming, combining, transitions and effects.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Social Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) shows all incoming messages as one list and your social feeds as another. You also get handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the two-column interface you can easily switch between your accounts, messages and feeds if you don't need all the stuff in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and unlimited navigation... in supported countries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, any money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 7.7 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and 3rd party SatNav apps are in danger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now though, turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them, the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.4GHz dual-core CPU and powerful graphics chip, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 can run every Android app designed for phones and slates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market has been recently rebadged as Google Play. It is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure that you won't be having a shortage of software to install on your Galaxy Tab 7.7. True, some apps aren't designed to work on a WXGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new design makes it easier for you to find the quality apps. There are featured apps, editors' picks and staff-recommended apps in addition to the usual top free and top paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn't forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and categories for the different types of apps so you don't get lost. Recommendations are also based on your location to make it even easier to spot a quality app in the new Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if by some reason, the soon-to-become number 1 app repository on the market isn't enough for you, you might want to check out some of the alternatives. Amazon has set up its own appstore and so has Opera, plus a few more minor app stores here and there. Choice is one of the best parts of the open platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own store called SamsungApps is also on board. There you can get a lot of free apps for your tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Users who rate portability above all else have plenty of choice of 7" tablets. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 should be top of their list if budget is of no issue. Super slim and lightweight, impressively built and good-looking, this is a tablet that knows portability doesn't begin or end with size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it's barely bigger than most seven-inchers and incredibly slim, but good use of space is not its only asset. The power-efficient and remarkably legible AMOLED screen, the solid battery backup, the expandable memory and the added voice call support complete a device that's hard to leave behind, even though tablets are not usually high on everyone's packing list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ten-inchers belong on the couch and look good on your coffee table. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 is the outdoor type. And it's got the looks to match. That's what we meant when we called it the kind of tablet the iPads should be wary of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, Samsung must have no illusions about ending Apple's tablet domination any time soon. But they won't give up putting pressure on them either. Their tablet lineup is entering its second generation and they've got not one but two ten-inchers man-marking the new iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their depth in the compact class is even more important. 7" tablets are a strictly Android affair (with a bit of BlackBerry for taste), so Samsung are leaving nothing to chance there. In fact, a couple of alternatives for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 come from within its own ranks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and the the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus are pretty much the same. They're both cheaper than the 7.7 as neither of them can match its screen resolution or the AMOLED technology. They don't have the processing power and the battery backup of the Galaxy Tab 7.7 either. They are more than decent budget versions nonetheless, complete with voice call support. The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is running Android 4 ICS out of the box and captures 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung P6200 Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus ? Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 P3100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad, which we recently reviewed, costs less than the Galaxy Tab 7.7, but offers the same screen resolution and aluminum unibody. It's got solid multimedia skills and supports voice calls. Its advantages over the Tab 7.7 are the HDMI port and the 5 megapixel camera but the flip side is a smaller battery and a less capable processor. And no AMOLED, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei MediaPad ? BlackBerry PlayBook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even cheaper options of course - and budget is a major point in favor of buying 7". The software update is a boost to the BlackBerry Playbook. Phone calls are enabled on the ZTE V9+. The HTC Flyer and the Acer Iconia Tab A101 have microSD card slots. The Apple iPad 2 is also an option worth considering now that it's cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    ZTE V9+ ? HTC Flyer ? Acer Iconia Tab A101 ? Apple iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there's nothing quite like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7. A yet to be announced  7" Toshiba tablet comes closest perhaps and that's considering we don't even know half of its specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are obviously cheaper tablets out there. There are better too but - as things stand now - they're all ten-inchers and that's a different kind of ball game. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 is special. The least you could do is keep up to date about the upcoming ICS upgrade and an inevitable price drop. They will make an already great device a bit better.</paragraph>
