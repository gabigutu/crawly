			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today Microsoft held a press conference in New York and it introduced three new Lumia smartphones as part of its newly charted strategy. The Lumia 950 XL is the long awaited flagship entry, the Lumia 950 targets the business class and the Lumia 550 seems line an excellent value for money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last July Microsoft announced a major restructuring, which started by writing off the Nokia acquisition and laying off 7,800 employees. Then the Windows, Phone, Tablet, Xbox, HoloLens and Band divisions were all united under a single Microsoft Devices with Terry Myerson serving as the unit's chief.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Microsoft decided to focus on three different niches on the phone market - flagship, business and value, and those would get just one or two phones each year. By lowering the phone sales and putting the focus to specific niches, Microsoft is hoping of cutting the losses and eventually start making money from those. This is a complete shift from the previous plans that were basically 'sell as many as you can'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, today we got one phone for each category and they sure look promising. Those three Lumia smartphones - 950 XL, 950 and 550 are also the first to run natively on Windows 10 for Phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spent some quality time with the Lumia 950 XL, Lumia 950 and Lumia 550 shortly after the event and our first impressions kick off right after the jump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also had some time with the new Band 2, the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 950 XL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you'd expected the next Windows flagship to break pattern and came up with brand new looks, we have to disappoint you. There is no metal or glass on the Lumia 950 XL, just the good old matte polycarbonate. It sure looks good on the Lumia devices and makes them easily recognizable and unique, but we kind of expected more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Lumia 950 XL, looks just like the Lumia 640 XL, it's just more powerful and offers a better display and camera. The phone is big, but not Lumia 1520 big, and feels great in hand thanks to the matte material.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.7" Quad HD AMOLED display is superb and the ClearBlack tech provides for even deeper blacks. We've always loved the Glance Screen and we are glad Microsoft is sticking with it within the new Windows 10 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 XL offers flagship-grade power thanks to the latest generation Snapdragon 810 chip, coupled with 3GB of RAM. The new generation of this SoC offers better thermal management, thanks to a newly implemented liquid cooling much like the one found on the Surface Pro 3. Microsoft promises no heating problems and blazing fast performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another major upgrade is the main 20MP PureView camera. In addition to the bigger sensor, it has been upgraded with ZEISS optics, optical stabilization and triple-LED RGB flash (no more red-eyes). It is placed on a circular piece of black glass that is making a small hump on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera is now a 5MP wide-angle one to help the selfie lovers. There is also iris recognition, which should compensate for the lack of fingerprint or similar advanced security tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Lumia 950 XL is occupied mostly by the screen, the earpiece and the front camera are above. All hardware keys are on the right of the smartphone, while the new USB Type C port is over at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When handled, the Lumia 950 XL feels solidly built and grippy thanks to its matte polycarbonate shell. However, the smartphone can?t match today?s high-end Android smartphones or the Apple iPhone in terms of tactility. On this instance, the newcomer unfortunately feels like any other Microsoft Lumia device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 XL supports rich connectivity options including LTE Cat.6 support, Optional Dual SIM, plus it has wireless charging support out of the box. Windows 10 Continuum feature is also available via a Microsoft Display Dock - you can dock the Lumia 950 XL there and it will extend to a full-blown desktop Windows 10 on your external monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This dock by the way is available for purchase, and it additionally supports mouse and keyboard input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 runs smooth on the Lumia 950 XL and while it looks a lot like its predecessor at first glance, there are major novelties that change the game. With the unification of Windows Desktop and Windows Phone we finally expect the Microsoft Store to catch up with apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw Windows Continuum on the Lumia 950 XL and it indeed transforms into a PC once connected to a monitor and keyboard via the dock. The Snapdragon 810 chip delivered lovely smooth performance with great multi-tasking, while you can still continue to use your phone. This feature alone makes the Lumia 950XL a worthy purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lumia 950 XL ticks all the right boxes and it is quite a tempting flagship. Hopefully, Microsoft's decision to stick with the old design won't hurt its sales. Microsoft will be selling the Lumia 950 XL for $649 starting this November.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 950 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 looks a lot like its XL sibling, but there are few notable changes. The camera hump is smaller, leaves the triple-LED RGB flash outside and the sensor is surrounded by metal instead of glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily the Lumia 950 keeps everything that makes the Lumia 950 XL great - it comes with a smaller 5.2" Quad HD AMOLED display protected with Gorilla Glass 3, the main camera is a 20MP PureView one with ZEISS optics, OIS and 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is even the 5MP front snapper and the iris recognition for Windows Hello unlocking. The new USB Type C port highlights the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we really like that Microsoft is sticking to its original policy for hardware shutter keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like its bigger sibling, the Microsoft Lumia 950 doesn?t feel as premium in hand as its specs suggest. We really hope that the optional premium third-party shells we saw for the 950 XL will be widely available for the smaller model. They will surely make the handset look and feel much better in person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 runs on a slightly less powerful Snapdragon 808, with a hexa-core processor and 3GB of RAM. The chipset also features liquid cooling, so heavy loads won't be resulting into hot phones. We've seen the 808 chip already in the LG G4 and we know it's quite a capable fella.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SoC change is probably the most important change in addition to the smaller display. The battery had to be shrunk a bit, but we think 3,000 mAh battery for a 5.2" is still quite e beefy supply. Plus, it supports wireless charging, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 runs on Windows 10 out of the box and you can opt for the Microsoft Display Dock, which will enable Windows 10 Continuum features. This way you can output the desktop version of your phone's Windows 10 on a big screen, you can evet plug and use mice and keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the Lumia 950 doing Continuum at the presentation and once again - the demo was nothing short of impressive. A phone that delivers desktop-great experience once hooked up to a monitor is something you can't find anywhere else to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 808 chip is clearly up to the task to handle the desktop Windows 10 hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft will be selling the Lumia 950 for $549 starting this November.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 550 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 is the smallest of the trio and represents the value category. It follows the Lumia design guidelines by the letter, so there are no surprises here - it's a phone made of matte plastic and feature a piece of Gorilla Glass 3 protection for the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's interesting though is the Lumia 550 is built around a 4.7" LCD screen of 720p resolution, which is a nice change for a budget phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 internals are less impressive though - it's a Snapdragon 210 chip with a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera is a 5MP AF snapper with a LED flash, while the front one is a 2MP tiny cam. Even though the camera is of lower resolution, Microsoft is still keeping the hardware shutter key, even for a rather affordable phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In hand, the Microsoft Lumia 550 feels like any of its budget-friendly predecessors. The handset sports a solidly built, swappable polycarbonate shell that will easily handle daily wear and tear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The storage is 8GB, expandable via microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 is in charge of operations, as usual, but there was no word on Windows 10 Continuum support, so either it won't offer it or we'll be checking it out for ourselves once the retail unit arrives at our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery unit of the Lumia 550 is rather modest at 2,100 mAh, but hopefully Microsoft has optimized the new Windows 10 enough for a balanced performance. It supports fast charging, but there is no wireless charging compatibility.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Band 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wearable tech is definitely in, no doubt about it, but the battle is still on to define wearable devices as a rightful and meaningful niche with its own purpose and development plan. The new Microsoft Band 2, announced on stage today is yet another attempt, which really blurs the already thin line between smart watches and fitness trackers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Band remains a device predominantly committed to fitness, but now with the addition of a lot more general usability and features. The Band 2 features a more comfortable curved screen that aims to sit flush on your wrist. It also offers a better Gorilla Glass 4 protection, optimized for a more precise and reliable touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Band 2 is just as smart as its predecessor and offers the same extensive array of sensors and adds some of its own. Its impressive feature set includes calorie and sleep tracking, guided workouts, US monitoring a built-in GPS and smart and customizable notification alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has also gone the extra mile in utilizing all the hardware and sensors in the band, like advanced integrated sport tracking for things like golf, as well as an industry-first VO2 Max estimation algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Microsoft Band 2 looks like a massive improvement over its clunky predecessor - it is much sleeker and better to wear. We will save out final judgment for the full review, but the device promises to be one of the most capable fitness trackers on the market when it becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for availability, thankfully, you won't have to wait long for the Band 2. Preorders start today and availability is set for October 30, for a price of $249.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Surface Pro 4 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As promised, Microsoft updated its high-end productivity tablet lineup today with the Surface Pro 4. The veritable convertible device has retained most of the design of its predecessor and the exact same form factor as well, while bringing some major improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the Surface Pro 4 has retained its footprint, but trimming the bezels allowed a more spacious 12.3" display to replace the 12" of the Surface Pro 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body was also slimmed-down and now sits at just 8.4mm, while still offering a magnesium build and a kickstand with a full-function multipurpose hinge. The display is impressively sharp with a resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels and 267 ppi. Naturally, the screen has also retained its convenient ten point multi-touch functionality, now more fluent and precise than ever thanks to Microsoft's new PixelSense Display technology. This all should amount to a beautiful viewing experience and also quite a lot of screen real estate to get your job done on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, most power users will be buying the Surface Pro 4 for its productivity while docked. The dock still plays a major part of the Surface experience and this new iteration is even convenient enough to be compatible with the accessories of its predecessor, namely the docking station and Type Cover. Now, there is something you don't see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an upgraded version of the signature keyboard, now complete with a fingerprint reader and a new button design, said to improve the all-important typing experience. The trackpad also got bigger by 40%, along with the promise of an improved scrolling experience thanks to its glass surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A big part of Surface is undoubtedly the stylus, which Microsoft has also pushed into the next generation. The Microsoft Pen now comes with a new design, complete with a virtual eraser on the back, which does just what you would think - an analog-style redo for your creations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pen also comes with a wide selection of interchangeable tips that can radically alter your writing or drawing experience, simulation anything from a fine-tip to a HD pencil. The Pen is capable of detecting an impressive 1024 levels of pressure and last, but not least, it now attaches to the side of the surface via magnet, so it is always at your convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, the Surface Pro 4 wouldn't be complete without some true horsepower under the hood. This year around, Microsoft has managed to cram an even more powerful sixth generation Intel chip (Core m, Core i5 or Core i7) inside the tablet, kept running cool by a new hybrid cooling system (there's a fan now).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet comes with an integrated Intel HD graphics chip (515, 520 or Iris 540, respectively). It can easily handle every task you throw at it. The rest of the specs include up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. Of course, Windows 10 runs the show, switching seamlessly between tablet-friendly and PC productivity modes and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Surface Pro 4 is clearly an evolution of last year?s groundbreaking iteration. Like its predecessor, the newcomer promises to be the most capable full-size tablet when it hits the retail shelves later this month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Surface Pro 4 starts at $899 goes all the way to $2,199. As for the Type Cover, it set you back $129.99 extra and $59.99 for the Surface Pen. Full specs sheets are also available at the source links.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Surface Book hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surface is now a laptop - the Microsoft Surface Book. Well, to be precise, it's a hybrid device with a keyboard base and a detachable tablet. "Ounce for ounce the most powerful 13-inch laptop," says Microsoft's new head of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the other Surface tablets have keyboards too, but thanks to the Dynamic Fulcrum hinge the Surface Book handles much more like a traditional laptop, you can safely pick it up by the screen. And if you detach the keyboard, you're left with a 720g (1.6 pounds) tablet. With the keyboard that goes up to 1,515g (3.5 pounds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is bigger - 13.5" - but keeps the sharp 267ppi pixel density, which means the resolution has been bumped up to 6MP (3000x2000px). The screen supports the same pen and touch experience Surface users are familiar with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For an old-school input, the keyboard offers backlit keys with 1.6mm travel and a glass trackpad with 5 touch points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface Book is massively powerful, Microsoft claims it's twice as fast as a MacBook Pro. It comes with a 6th gen Intel Core (i5 or i7), up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. All that and you're looking at 12 hours of battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xbox team was asked to lend its GPU know-how and the Book packs a GeForce GPU. It will be used for gaming, of course, but will help GPU accelerated apps too (the demo was video editing). Note that the GPU is optional and goes into the keyboard base, when you detach that the Intel GPU takes over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other goodies include stereo speakers on the front, a magnesium body, two USB 3.0 ports and a full size SD card slot. You also get a 5MP selfie camera plus an 8MP camera on the back (which looks unusual on a laptop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface Book will cost $1,500. Pre-orders start on October 7, while full retail availability will come on October 26.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has really nailed it with the Surface Book. Superbly designed and beautifully crafted, the hybrid notebook is a worthy flagship for the Redmond giant?s brand new OS - it carries an aura of desirability that truly caught us by surprise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is clearly shifting focus and now it chooses to target three specific categories - flagship, business and value. And while we don't exactly think the polycarbonate material is flagship-grade, the standard Lumia 950 for the business definitely nailed it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three Lumia smartphones announced today seems like a thoughtful additions and a hopeful fresh start. The new Windows 10 shows massive potential and Microsoft has already proven it has the means to make it the game changer it should have been from the start. Hopefully everything plays well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the flagship Lumia 950 XL is a beast under the hood, probably the Lumia 950 is the one most of the people will be looking forward to. We know from experience Windows OS can be as smooth and optimized as iOS on the iPhone, and that's why a Snapdragon 808 chip should be more than enough for handling pretty much everything but the heaviest of games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we've seen enough to believe Windows has a chance and Microsoft can pull it out of the murky waters. Sure, there is a lot more work to be done, but things are looking good for now. And that affordable Lumia 550 may as well break sells records during the upcoming holidays, like the Lumia 520 once did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the new monsters Surfaces Pro 4 and Surface Book, Microsoft is finally stepping on the Apple's toes. While the MacBooks have been stuck the recent years with non-touch displays and lack of innovation, Microsoft has just made them run for their money with the new Surface Book. It indeed looks like an ultimate laptop and Microsoft has every right to call it that way. And the tablet has never been as powerful as the new Pen-enabled Surface Pro 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, with the upcoming Windows 10 update for the Xbox, the HoloLens kit shipping in just few months and the new Microsoft Band 2 being exactly what people wanted it to be, we think Microsoft are finally on the right track to shake the market and challenge the competition. We just can't wait.</paragraph>
