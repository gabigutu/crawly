		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It will take crowds erupting in delight to silence the ring of the "burning platform" speech in the Nokia Lumia 800's ears. The speaker being Nokia CEO Stephen Elop and the burning platform Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As Nokia are starting over, the Lumia 800 would do well not to look back. It's certainly beyond the ifs and buts. A shadow still lingers though. And there are people out there - loyal Nokia users too - who would've jumped in the fire with MeeGo rather than the freezing waters of Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it was for others to decide. The N9 was ordered to share its impressive unibody design with the Lumia 800. Good decision by Nokia - not saying fair - to give its WP7 pioneer a strong start. There are some Windows Phone mandated changes like the touch-sensitive Back, Menu and Search keys and a hardware shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen lost 0.2" and 54 pixels in height to make room for the capacitive controls. The oddly positioned secondary camera is gone as well. Still, the image quality of the screen seems unchanged - and we quite liked that AMOLED unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What else has changed? Well, there's a new chipset, among other things. To make this short, here're the pros and cons of the Nokia Lumia 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strong showing by Nokia, but it's a bit late to the Windows Phone party. They do have the design experience from being in the business longer than almost anyone else and they have Nokia Drive as their ace in the hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fate of the company rests on Windows Phone Nokias being a success and much of that weight falls on the shoulders of the Lumia 800. It won't carry it alone, but it's the leader of the pack, the attention grabber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And sure enough, it has our attention. But it's you the Nokia Lumia 800 has to wow, so sit down and let us tell you about its hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia Lumia 800<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 800 comes in a box similar to that of the N9 and with similar contents. There's a rubber case in the same color as your phone. Once you put it on, the look of the handset barely changes (it gets thicker though). The good news is protection from scratches doesn't compromise the good looks of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there are no surprises. Under the usual set of manuals, you'll find a compact, oddly shaped (though still good looking) charger that connects to the microUSB cable to charge the phone. The single piece headset looks quality too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 800 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 is easy to spot in a crowd - the polycarbonate unibody with a distinctive combination of curves and straight lines can only be mistaken for the Nokia N9, though sadly there probably aren?t many of those around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is not the slimmest Windows Phone, but it makes a claim to be the most beautiful. It measures 116.5 x 61.2 x 12.1 mm (exactly the same as the N9) and weighs 142g (7g heavier than its MeeGo counterpart).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Lumia 800 flanked by the N9 and the Samsung Omnia W. The Lumia 800 and the Omnia W have the same screen size (3.7"), the same resolution (WVGA) and both are PenTile AMOLED units. We'll be having a closer look at them in a moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body seems very sturdy, it can take a few knocks and not show it. The polycarbonate is colored itself rather than painted, so no peeling paint issues and even a deep scratch won't reveal anything but the same color as the rest of the body. Speaking of which, the Nokia Lumia 800 comes in black, cyan or magenta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Corning Gorilla glass makes sure the display won't get scratched either. Under that tough cover hides a polarizing filter that reduces reflections and improves the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is a 3.7" AMOLED unit of WVGA resolution (480 x 800 pixels). Yes, it is a PenTile matrix - meaning each pixel has two subpixels instead of three - but the high 251ppi pixel density means that most people won?t notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia's closest competitor, the Samsung Omnia W also uses a PenTile matrix for its 3.7" WVGA screen, so we decided to put them under the magnifying glass. The Nokia N9 is also along for the ride. Here are the close-up shots where you can see the PenTile arrangement clearly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, both look practically identical. There are slight differences due to different color processing (so some pixels light up brighter), but that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indoors, the viewing experience is great - the display is basically glued to the Gorilla Glass on top, which makes it look almost as if the icons are painted on the surface of the handset when you look at an extreme angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen continues to impress outdoors in the sun too - it remains perfectly visible, while the colors keep most of their punch too. The anti-glare polarizer is certainly making a difference, as the Lumia 800 probably has the least-reflective screen we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800's touchscreen is very responsive and the edges of the scratch-resistant glass that cover it are convex (the display itself is flat). This means your finger glides easily from side to side - and using Windows Phone involves a lot of sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We measured the maximum brightness of the Lumia 800's screen to see how it stacks up against other AMOLEDs and the LCDs. As usual, contrast is theoretically infinite though reflections mean it's practically some really high number. The low reflectivity of this particular screen makes it that much more impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the brightness, the Nokia N9 had one of the brightest AMOLED screens we've seen, easily topping SuperAMOLED in this regard. We expected the same from the Lumia 800, but we were disappointed - at the brightest setting, the 800 was only as bright as the N9 at 50% brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's comparable to the SuperAMOLED on the Omnia W, for what that's worth, but it doesn?t defeat it soundly as we expected based on the N9's performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Here's a list showing how the Lumia compares to the competition:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One trick that the Nokia N9 does that leverages on its AMOLED screen is that the clock is visible even when the screen is off. The Lumia 800 doesn?t do that, most likely because Windows Phone can't. We miss that feature, a cool and easy way to tell the time with a single glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you shift your gaze away from the screen, you'll see the earpiece above the screen and if you look closely, you'll spot the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three Windows Phone keys - Back, Menu and Search - which are touch-sensitive and light up in white when the screen is on. Thanks to the deep blacks of the AMOLED screen, the three keys almost look like a part of the screen itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to the Nokia Lumia 800's right side to find the three hardware controls. You get a flat volume rocker that's not the easiest thing to use and a Power/Lock key just underneath it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A little further down is the two-step shutter key. It's raised higher than the other keys and fairly comfortable to use. Because of the lower positioning of the camera lens on the back, you can hold the Lumia 800 much like a standard point-and-shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia Lumia 800 is completely bare, while the bottom features the loudspeaker grill. The microphone pinhole is also supposed to be at the bottom, though we couldn't spot it so it might be under the same grill as the speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker won't get muffled when you place the phone down on a table but the grill quickly gathers dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia 800 features the 3.5mm audio jack and also the microSIM compartment and microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is covered by a plastic lid that has a small nub to swing it open. It's a clever design but has a downside - L-shaped USB cables won't work as the lid gets in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you open that door, you can use your nail on the small notch to slide the microSIM card compartment to the left slightly (or you can just push it down and slide left). The microSIM card tray pops out and you can pull it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We said "microSIM" a few times but it bears repeating - it's a new, relatively rare standard that the Nokia Lumia 800 shares with the N9, iPhone 4 and 4S. If you get the Lumia 800, you'll either have to ask your carrier to swap your regular SIM card (possibly at a certain price) or cut it down to size yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We complete our tour at the back of the Nokia 800, which has its edges tapered very similarly to the front. It fits the shape of the hand perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens is on the back, placed lower than on most phones. As we already mentioned, this makes holding the phone while taking a photo quite comfortable as you don't need to worry about your hand covering the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the lens, it's Carl Zeiss-certified, as the strip of metal that accommodates it is proud to announce. It has an f/2.2 aperture, which according to Nokia lets in 75% more light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor is pretty special too - it has 8.7 million pixels and works in two modes. You can choose between 4:3 8MP and 16:9 7.1MP photos. Other 8MP shooters typically drop down to 6MP when shooting 16:9, so a loss of less than a megapixel in widescreen mode is quite an achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s worth saying that the Lumia 800 has exactly the same camera unit as of that on the N9, however allegedly they are tuned slightly different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dual-LED flash next to the camera and it promises to be 20% brighter than previous LED units by Nokia despite being smaller. It won't glow red during video recording like the N9's flash does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-removable battery has a 1450mAh capacity and Nokia say it's good for 265 hours of standby in 2G (335 hours in 3G). Talk times are respectively 13 hours and 9 hours and 30 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 should last for 55 hours of music playback or 7 hours of video. We'll post our own numbers when the test completes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved sides of the Nokia Lumia 800 make it very comfortable to wrap your hands around it. The polycarbonate shell is pleasant to the touch (though quick to gather fingerprints) and all the controls are easy to reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels solid but not too heavy and even though it's not the slimmest handset around, its beveled edges should make it easy to slip into pockets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, so this part felt rather familiar. The software part will have equal measures of deja vu, but several Nokia add-ons (like the free SatNav app, Drive) should be enough of a plot twist.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Windows Phone Mango interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite some talk that Nokia would be allowed to modify the Windows Phone interface, the Lumia 800 uses a completely unmodified interface. It?s fine with us, but there's nothing to differentiate it from the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very fluid vertical grid of Live tiles that shows one or two tiles organized in bricked style. Each of these can be reorganized by which ever order you like and you can place almost anything in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a clean and simple interface. The Live tiles show stuff such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more, all without the need to open up any of the respective applications. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts. But that?s oversimplifying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Windows Phone Mango the Live tiles are quicker and offer more info. For example, the Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile (Groups is a Mango-only feature to boot) lists friend updates. The application list has grown a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo of the Nokia Lumia 800 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 800 comes with 7.5 Mango and one of its advantages over the original version is multitasking. The OS still doesn?t do true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old-fashioned way, which has the drawback of starting it over from the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, apps with active background tasks (e.g. streaming online radio) will keep on working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save on battery life. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app you have installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People Hub as a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first tab of the People hub that shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single photo. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What?s new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 wasn?t the best when it came to holding on to a weak signal. The in-call sound is good, but you should beware of dropped calls in areas with poor coverage. Again, that?s really a subjective test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Lumia 800 did good in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test on the Nokia Lumia 800 and it got a Below Average mark. It's rather quiet, so you need to keep it very close to you or you might miss calls. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependant on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email where Mango contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the highly requested feature was a unified inbox for email - and Windows Phone 7.5 delivers. You can now link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn?t the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection and copy-paste functionality were desired functions even before the 7.5 Mango update. They became a reality with the pre-Mango No-Do update. Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-res Picture tile is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub has been polished up a bit in Windows Phone Mango. There's a new People tab, which lets you browse photo albums by individual contacts or groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite restricted when it came to sharing - it's still not perfect (it still downsizes photos before emailing them, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the Lumia 800, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos and Nokia Music too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won?t have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Music works as a general music player but with a location-aware twist. You also get access to the Nokia Music store, which is an alternative to the Zune Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don?t like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware feature is called Gigs - as the name suggests, it finds concerts near your location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Recent Nokia smartphones tend to offer pretty good sonic experience and it appears that the Nokia Lumia 800 will be no exception to the rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 800 exhibited decent loudness and reasonably clean output when connected to an active external loudspeaker. Its scores were excellent for the most part, except for the distortion levels, which were higher than average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we are currently having some issues with our audio testing equipment that concern the headphones on part of our usual test. That's why we won't be posting the Nokia Lumia 800 scores with a pair of headphones attached, until we've fully resolved them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 06 Dec: We were finally able to complete the second part of our test, but unfortunately the Nokia Lumia 800 didn't exactly pass it with flying colors. With headphones plugged in the smartphone dramatically changed its frequency response, cutting-off the bass frequencies, while its stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion spiked. Quite unconvincing performance for a flagship device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP Carl Zeiss camera fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 has an 8MP camera with a lot to brag about - it has a 28mm wide-angle F2.2 lens by Carl Zeiss and as we already mentioned in the hardware section of this review the sensor behind the lens is quite clever too. It produces 8MP photos with 4:3 aspect ratio or 7.1MP photos if you want 16:9 aspect ratio for your shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 800 may have the same camera module as the N9, but the new chipset has different image processing. The amount of detail is good, but there's noticeable color noise left in the photos. The noise processing in the N9 did better by eliminating the color noise and not losing as much fine detail. Sill, the Lumia 800 has accurate white balance and good color rendering. The dynamic range is as impressive as it was on the N9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go some Nokia Lumia 800 full-res camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a macro shot, here it is.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 steps up in our photo quality compare tool to face other 8MP shooters. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we were lining up the shot for the first chart, we noticed a huge pink spot. That was gone as soon as we snapped the photo. The color patches in the second chart look accurate, but you can spot color noise, especially in the blue patches. The third chart is shot under artificial lighting and the automatic color balanced produced a blue shot, so when shooting indoors, you might want to set the white balance to incandescent/fluorescent for more accurate results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording can be great, but needs more work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can use scenes, calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone has yet to break the 1080p barrier and the Lumia 800 isn't the phone to do it. It's limited to 720p, which is now within the reach of cheaper smartphones. Still, it's quality, not quantity that we're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available while recording. The Lumia 800 was way too eager to hunt for focus - if there's constant action in the scene, the Lumia 800 would refocus every several seconds, which gets really annoying. There's no way to lock the focus and the camera would always focus at the beginning of the video (even if you make it focus before you start recording).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the N9 (and a lot of other phones too), the Nokia Lumia 800 shoots videos with varying framerate. We've seen anything from 25fps (usually in dark scenes) to 30fps (in well-lit scenes). And depending which framerate it goes for, you would get either a smooth or a slightly choppy video. The Nokia Lumia 800 might be good enough for shooting not too fast-paced scenes, but for that price tag we really expected better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is surprisingly good - there's a lot of detail for a 720p shooter, the image looks crisp and free of noise and artifacts. Videos are shot with 15Mbps bitrate, which is more than some 1080p shooters and double of what the N9 does. Videos have stereo sound but at a low bitrate (it hovers around 50Kbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Nokia would fix the autofocus issue and bump up the audio bitrate (the N9 des 132Kbps), we'd be very happy with the video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an example of what the Nokia Lumia 800 is capable of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched 720p@30fps video sample (0:10s, 17.9MB) from the Lumia 800's camera for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time for the Nokia Lumia 800 to go into our video quality comparison database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as synthetic resolution goes, it did really good. The positive impressions remained even in our other setup that's closer to real-life usage. In the dark, the image gets noisy but still preserves good amounts of detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is abundant with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and quad-band 3G with HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone ? there's no Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of it available too - Windows Phone 7 Connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Lumia 800 doesn't offer such an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings Wi-Fi hotspot functionality too. All you need is an active SIM card with a data connection and you're all set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer mobile does without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone was updated to the latest version for the 7.5 update and it improves the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is always visible (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling hasn?t been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What has changed is performance - the new browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine has been retooled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't be afraid to pit the phone against even a desktop browser - the tests are pretty demanding and if you're not running a recent version of the major desktop browsers, your computer will surely break a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search on Windows Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also grew two new search modes - song recognition and barcode scanner. Those are features popular with apps, but with WP7.5 you get those natively as part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Bing does regular web searches for pages or images and can look for interesting locations nearby.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace just now catching up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. Currently it has north of 38 thousand apps available. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games and music. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app preloaded by Nokia is App Highlights - it gives you an assortment of apps into several categories to give you a start. The first category is actually called Starter kit - a list of what are considered vital apps (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, etc.), then there's Addictive (games go here), Health+ and Foodies have apps to keep fit and to gorge yourself respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accelerometer-enabled and can reshuffle the lists of applications every time you shake the phone, which is a fun way to find new apps. Also, the tile for the app would occasionally change to advertise some of the apps it recommends to get your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the Nokia Lumia 800, the 1.4GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps lights your path<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications (we'll discuss them in the next section).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 managed to get a GPS lock quickly (about a minute) and you can make that even faster if you have a data connection for the A-GPS. Wi-Fi and Cell-ID positioning is also available if you only need a rough position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps wasn't preinstalled on our unit - there was an app that showed screenshots of Maps plus a link to the Marketplace to get it. It's a simple operation and once you're done, you can start using Nokia Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an alternative to Microsoft's Bing Maps. It lets you view maps in three different modes - map, satellite and public transport. You can use pinch zoom to navigate the map (you can also enable old-school zoom controls) and panning around is fast and smooth. Nokia Maps does only 2D mode - there's no 3D option like Google Maps has for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It pulls its maps from the Internet, so you'll need an Internet connection to use it. Not even if you have downloaded offline maps for Nokia Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the more interesting part of the duo - Nokia Drive. Unlike Maps, Nokia Drive lets you easily download maps for offline usage for any country in the world - free of charge, of course. Bigger countries are split into pieces, if you don't want to waste your internal memory with maps you'll never use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps aren't that big though - the map for the whole US is 1.9GB, while the map for the whole UK, for example, is 274MB. The 16GB built-in memory is more than enough for any trip you're likely to take. It's easy to delete unneeded maps or download new ones on the go wherever there is Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One rather annoying problem right now is that Drive can't plan routes in offline mode - you can browse the map, but not start a new route. There's a fix from Nokia incoming though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive does support a 3D view, unlike Maps. It also has 3D landmarks for some of the bigger world cities. You can also use 2D mode if that's what you prefer, but in 3D you get to see further down the road than in 2D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than 2D/3D, settings are pretty scarce - you can toggle daylight and night color schemes, choose whether landmarks should be displayed and choose a voice for the navigation. Many voices in a big number of languages are available for free download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were hoping for options to fine-tune the routing algorithm - like avoid toll roads, find fastest or shortest route and so on - but there were none to be had. You just set your destination (with an option to review the planned route before you go), hit start and you're off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While navigating, you can zoom in and out depending on you preference to see more of the road ahead or more details. At the top of the screen is an instruction for the next turn in big, easy to read white on blue letters and a big icon noting the turn. At the bottom of the screen you have readings for how much you have to travel before reaching your destination and also you're current speed. Those get pushed to the left side of the screen in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like Nokia Drive's no-distraction's approach to navigation, but we are used to having more control over how the route is chosen. A few other options would have been welcomed too (the Symbian version of Nokia's SatNav solution is very feature-rich).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, with the Nokia Lumia 800 you get what no other Windows Phone handset on the market currently offers. The free voice-guided navigation might be just what it takes to convince people to go for the Lumia 800, instead of competing WP phones ? at least in that price range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Now, docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The business side of Windows Phone has its own list of cool updates in version 7.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use and has an iOS-esque interface. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an app called Contacts Transfer, which does just that - it pairs with another phone over Bluetooth and leeches out your address book. This makes switching from your old phone to the Nokia Lumia 800 a smooth sailing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your Nokia Lumia 800 might come with some more regional apps preinstalled. For example, the British version comes with a British Airways app and another one called Ministry of Sound.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WindowsPhone.com remotely protects your data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory - Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a lot riding on the Nokia Lumia 800 and the Finns put a lot of work into it - well, they worked for a long time anyway. The final result manages to impress, but also brings some disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much we can say about the OS - here all Windows Phone handsets are evenly matched. But with its three proprietary apps, Nokia manages to put the Lumia 800 in a class of its own. Nokia Drive, the most valuable of the three, may not please Symbian fans, but it's designed entirely in the spirit of Windows Phone - simple to use, with clean, readable labels that are free of distractions (all positives when talking about SatNav apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has plenty of potential too - as it is, it's one of the best shooters in the Windows Phone world and has the potential to get even better with a software update that clears up some of its issues (like the overly eager continuous autofocus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curvy polycarbonate shell and Gorilla Glass with smooth, beveled edges give a huge boost to the Lumia 800's desirability too. The display is pretty great too, though the somewhat low brightness levels were kind of a disappointment. Still, it's better than most WP phones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During this review, we were constantly bringing up the Nokia N9 - and with good reason. It shares in the great features of the Lumia 800 and does better than it in some respects. But with a niche OS and intentionally high price tag, mainstream acceptance will probably always remain out of its reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For comparison?s sake, the Samsung Omnia W is a similar Windows Phone. It features a SuperAMOLED screen that's a match for the Lumia's. The phone is thinner too, though it uses regular plastic and metal for its build (not necessarily bad, but it's ordinary). It also loses points on the lower-res camera (5MP), smaller storage (8GB) and most of all - no free SatNav. There are navigation apps for WP already in the Marketplace, so that can be resolved (unlike the fixed amount of storage). But on the other hand, its SIM-free price is almost half of the Lumia?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N9 ? Samsung Omnia W I8350</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan forgoes AMOLED and instead equips itself with one of the biggest screens on a mobile phone. It goes heavy on the metal and light on the plastic too. But if you like AMOLEDs and you don?t really care if you will be using a mainstream OS or not, then maybe the Samsung S8600 Wave III has that to offer along with an attractive metal build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Titan ? Samsung S8600 Wave III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking at the Lumia 800, then you've probably decided against an iPhone or an Android smartphone. You want in on Windows Phone and that's that - and the 800 is a good entry point. The OS has matured, the Marketplace has grown and Nokia demonstrates its know-how in phone design and services with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 800 will sell well - it has already risen to the top spots in popularity for several carriers. It will boost Nokia's market shares and Windows Phone's shares too - but chances are it won't dethrone the leaders. The bigger question is, will it save Nokia from their burning platform? It's too soon to tell.</paragraph>
