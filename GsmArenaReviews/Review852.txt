			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No other pair of droids will have you sitting on a fence like these two. Alright, a bold statement indeed. But if anything in it is to be taken literally, it's the fence. In the end though, home turf for both, this isn't about which side has the greener lawn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG is once again challenging longtime rivals Samsung and it's phablets where this battle reaches epic proportions. Last year, LG took its sweet time to respond to the Galaxy Note 2 and the long wait was well worth it. The G Pro was a remarkable device, no less impressive despite LG's failure to properly monetize on their lead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a rematch at hand, it looks like the same scenario all over again, but it's not that straightforward. Yes, it's another five months between them, but LG will have to try harder this time. They set their own bar quite high to begin with, while Samsung will certainly not see another victory slip through its fingers. The Galaxy Note 3 has seen a lot of battles, but this one is more personal than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see what both companies have in store for one another.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over the LG G Pro 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, the two phablets are nearly identical. From the FullHD display and Snapdragon 800 chipset, to the 3200mAh battery and imaging - each of them does 13MP stills and 4K videos, and does them well .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means we have to look way beyond the spec sheets to draw the line, so let's get right to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We may be dealing with a pair of the finest species of phablet, but size is still something to definitely consider. For some people, even a 5" screen is beyond what's comfortable to hold and operate. Although clearly unable to offer the ultimate portability, these two devices deserve credit for design and efficient use of the available space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the LG G Pro 2 is a tad larger than the Galaxy Note 3 and the 0.2" difference in screen diagonal accounts for the slightly larger footprint. The G Pro 2 has inherited the ultra-slim bezels of the original, which help it achieve a screen-to-surface ratio of 77.2%, against the Note 3's 74.8%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>8.3mm of thickness, which the two Korean phablets share, is nothing spectacular (the Xperia Z line has gone below 7mm in both phablets and tablets) but it's slim alright and they both feel great in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 is heavier by just 4 grams - which isn't a difference you'd feel or notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones opt for plastic build, but that's where the similarities end, as they're very different in terms of finish and button layout. The LG G Pro 2 sticks to the rear-mounted lock key and volume controls. The front and sides feature no physical keys whatsoever, which is one of the cleanest looks to have in a smartphone. The G Pro 2 is essentially an up-scaled G2, and that's a compliment rather than a complaint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on the other hand goes for a completely new kind of finish creating a convincing leather look and feel. The faux stitching very much contributes to that and the overall result is quite pleasant. Had this been the first iteration for both designs, we'd probably have a hard time taking a side, but since the Galaxy Note 3 is the one to bring a dash of novelty we are giving it the nod when it comes to looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the front, the impressively big and sharp screens get all the attention but you'll probably notice the G Pro 2's stylish earpiece grille. The Galaxy Note 3 traditionally has a hardware home key below the screen at the bottom, which makes it instantly recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the finish isn't the only thing that sets these two apart. Although very similar in terms of size and even what goes under the hood, the G Pro 2 is subtly curved for a modern, streamlined look, while the angular and masculine Note 3 is slightly more conservative and businesslike. Anyway, both devices have a solid feel in hand and uncompromising build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pro 2 is said to have a non-slip metal mesh finish on the back cover for a more secure grip. The polycarbonate back is impressively lightweight and resistant to cracks too, which are both important attributes of a removable cover. Sadly, we can't back LG on the "non-slip" finish. The feel is nice, but rather glassy. The Galaxy Note 3's back has a lot more texture to it, resulting in a better grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the standard three-button layout of a physical Home button and capacitive Menu and Back keys. The two capacitive keys illuminate when touched, but when their backlighting is off they blend in and seemingly disappear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, around a prominent earpiece are the usual proximity and ambient light sensors, as well as a 2MP 1080p-video-capable front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the hardware controls moved around back, there's very little going on at the LG G Pro 2's front. Above the big and sharp IPS display, a 2.1MP secondary camera, proximity and ambient light sensors and a LED status light are scattered around the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is a lot busier, the optically-stabilized 13MP camera lens sharing a stylish chrome plate with the power/lock button and the volume keys. There's also a 1W speaker here, which LG says offers Hi-Fi studio quality. Now, that might be a bit too much to ask from a speaker this tiny, but the sound it delivers is crisp and loud nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the power button on the right side and the volume rocker on the left in the typical Samsung fashion. The microSIM and microSD card slots, along with the removable battery are located under the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM and microSD card slots on the LG G Pro 2 are under the battery cover too, which on the Korean version of the phone is removable. Although the rear-mounted lock key may feel a bit awkward at first, and take some time to get used to, it's not your only option. The Knock-on feature lets you wake the screen up by a simple double-tap. The novelty in the G Pro 2 is a more secure unlock routine called Knock code - unlocking you screen using a series of taps only you know, and you don't need to wake the phone up for that to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the power button and volume rocker on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are harder to reach as they are placed too high up on the sides, while those same keys on the G Pro 2 are right where your index finger rests on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise-reducing secondary microphone on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is placed on the top of the device next to the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The other thing to note there is the IR emitter, which can be quite handy for controlling home appliances and TVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom lies the speaker under a small grille, the primary microphone, the S Pen holster and a microUSB 3.0 port (which is fully backwards compatible with microUSB 2.0).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the LG G Pro 2 also packs the nifty IR blaster, it only has a microUSB 2.0 connectivity port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack sits at the top of the G Pro 2 alongside the IR blaster, whereas the microUSB port is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens and single LED flash create a small bulge at the back of the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 on the other hand keeps the rear profile as streamlined as possible - and that's quite impressive considering the built-in optical image stabilization. There's a single LED flash here too, on the right side of the lens. The second microphone is on top, next to the 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, being phablets, these are not the easiest devices to handle and operate single-handedly. For one, reaching to the top corners of the screen would be nearly impossible single-handedly. Both however offer single-hand mode - and the Note 3 can argue that it's not meant for single-hand use in the first place. The S-pen is of course making a massive difference and is something the G Pro 2 just doesn't have a meaningful response to. The rear-placed controls and the excellent screen-to-surface ratio are its weapons - and they're well used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: A tie. Blows were traded but neither managed to decisively get the upper hand. The LG G Pro 2 has the rear-mounted hardware buttons, impressively slim bezels, great build, Knock on and Knock code. The difference in screen size is offset by the virtual on-screen controls eating into the available real estate. The slightly more compact Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has USB 3.0 and looks extra sharp emulating leather and metal. The leather-like finish is the styling of choice for all the premium devices in the Galaxy lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end though, it's things like memory expansion, a user-accessible battery and flagship-grade build quality going both ways that make this a definite tie.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll tell you straight away that both devices have top-notch screens. The LG G Pro 2 is slightly more generous in terms of size - 5.9" vs the 5.7" of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Resolution is identical - 1080 x 1920px - but the pixel density is slightly higher on the shorter screen diagonal of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - 386 ppi against the 373 ppi of the G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, at this high level the difference is unperceivable to the naked eye. You can rest assured that both screens are as sharp as they get - at least until QHD resolution starts hitting handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED unit on the Note 3 is the traditional choice in premium Samsung devices and it offers great contrast and color saturation. The LG G Pro 2 packs an IPS Plus LCD screen, which isn't as contrasty, but has reportedly more accurate color reproduction .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of software adjustments, Samsung has enabled different screen modes on the Galaxy Note 3. Dynamic is the most saturated of them, while Professional photo provides a more realistic color setting. While different modes don't give you as much freedom as the fine tuning sliders on Nokia devices, they still provide enough flexibility and are somewhat easier to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's adapt display, which optimizes the color range and saturation when you're browsing content in the gallery, camera, browser, etc. This mode, however, won't apply to third-party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, to save power the Galaxy Note 3 can automatically adjust screen tone depending on the on-screen content. What the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 sadly fails to offer is information on the lockscreen that's always visible even when the screen is otherwise off - along the lines of Nokia Glance. That shouldn't have been too hard on an AMOLED screen, which needs to only illuminate an area of a few pixels to display time or tiny notification icons, leaving the rest of the screen off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD on the LG G Pro 2 has an RGB matrix - the standard arrangement of red, green and blue sub-pixels. The screen on the Galaxy Note 3 uses a diamond PenTile matrix type, which is known to be the cause of visible crosshatch - though honestly not at this level of pixel density. The PenTile matrix uses OLED sub-pixels of different sizes as each color has different levels of power efficiency and longevity. Sub-pixel rendering is employed to properly distribute each of the primary colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers in our display test, both devices are well above average - and that's at or near the top of the price range - without being the best. The AMOLED screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the deepest blacks and a practically infinite contrast ratio. It's the maximum brightness that's usually the weak point of these displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 has pretty decent levels of black and nearly double the brightness level at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for contrast, the G Pro 2 is an okay performer with decent numbers but falls short of leaders in the field, such as the HTC One or Sony Xperia Z1. But both phablets beat the Sony Xperia Z Ultra in the contrast section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the sunlight legibility test where we look at how the screen performs outdoors. The AMOLED unit on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has seriously reduced reflectivity thanks to a glass layer less, which compensates for the average brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2's screen is clearly more reflective??, which hinders its outdoor performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To sum up - both devices have great displays with good color reproduction and solid numbers on brightness, blacks and contrast. When dealing with displays, usually more is better but in this case it was the outdoor performance that was the true deciding factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, the extra options that Samsung provides also tip the scales in Samsung's favor. The only advantage of the G Pro 2 in this round is the slightly larger display. However, that's not nearly enough to make up for its downsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery backup is another department where the two are even, at least on paper. Both are powered by a Li-Ion 3200mAh unit. It will be down to the software and optimizations to determine the winner in the battery life comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the talk time component, the LG G Pro 2 managed to last the whopping 7 hours and 25 minutes more than the Note 3 - a level of battery efficiency that borders on sorcery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's a similar story in the web browsing. Since our test consists primarily of pages with a white background, the Super AMOLED display of the Note 3 is using more battery power. It's not too bad though for the Note 3, at 9 hours and 4 minutes against the LG G Pro 2's 9 hours and 31 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Combining the results and taking into account the standby consumption, we get quite the twist in the end. The Samsung Galaxy Note manages an endurance rating of 75 hours, whereas the LG G Pro 2 scores 61 hours. It almost feels like LG didn't care too much about video playback and standby when some more careful optimizations would've helped the G Pro 2 get a lot closer, if not outlast, the Note 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Meet the most feature-rich<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're taking a step into the wild here. People familiar with stock Android will hardly recognize what we're dealing with here and that's because both Samsung and LG have done quite a big number on stock Android in favor of their own TouchWiz and Optimus UI OSes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get down to business here are two videos to get you up to speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in action</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 in action</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is very well known for its over-the-top features and customizations, while LG has been known for some time now as a copycat of many, if not all, Samsung innovative features. We'll get to those in a second but first let's see about the lockscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's take on the Android lockscreen stays close to stock but adds some customization options. For starters you have more than one lockscreen pane and you can place widgets on each one. You can also go for five shortcuts to apps on the lockscreen, which are customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also has a personal message option as well. Finally, there's a camera shortcut in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also has multiple lockscreen panes able to carry widgets. There's also a camera shortcut on the right and the ability to set shortcuts to five apps on the bottom. So they are pretty neck and neck thus far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However here's where LG gets more creative. Starting off with the Knock Core unlock. It allows you to unlock the device with a predefined knock pattern, including taps in a specific part of the display. LG says there are 86,367 possible knock patterns (each taking from 2 to 8 taps on the four available sections of the screen) and yours should be as impossible to break as a password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is Guest Mode - it's activated by a specific unlock pattern. There's no app drawer in guest mode - you can access five apps by default: camera, video and music players, calculator and quick remote. You can, of course, make more apps available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To redeem itself the Galaxy Note 3 features the Quick glance feature. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen and shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info - all without touching a button (or screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung notification area plays host to a horizontally-scrollable list of quick toggles (five in portrait and eight in landscape mode) for easy access to various settings. Under them there's a useful brightness slider - it can be adjusted for a minimum brightness which come in quite handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally come expandable notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Optimus UI's notification area is very close. It also has five quick toggles in portrait and, you guessed it, eight in landscape. There's also a brightness and even volume slider in the notification areas and the brightness slider can be adjusted for a minimum brightness setting like on the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens are again, more of the same. There are five docked icons on each homescreen (including one app drawer shortcut), there are apps and widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've criticized Samsung before on this one. Instead of capitalizing on the larger display Samsung is presenting users with nothing more than an oversized Galaxy S4 (or S5) user interface with the same 4x4 app icon grid on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG allows for an additional fifth line making for a 5x4 grid of apps. Not exactly utilizing the full potential of larger screen canvas compared to a G2 but still a little better than the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG does allow you to change individual app icons, a feature lacking on the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes Q Slide - it lets you have miniature apps on top of the UI. You can resize the mini app the way you like, and there is a dedicated shortcut that'll take you to the full screen app. There is also a transparency scrubber - once you decrease the transparency even by a hair, the mini app is no longer part of the active UI (besides its transparency scrubber) and you can interact with whatever's beneath it (the mini app will continue its work of course, i.e. a video will still be playing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We critiqued the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for bringing an upsized Galaxy S4 UI to the much bigger display but Samsung did make up for that in other areas of the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, you can shrink down the UI by performing an edge swipe. This downsizes the whole active screen to only a portion of real screen. You can still use the Galaxy Note 3 as you'd normally would and the whole navigation process becomes manageable with a single hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's take on this feature is the One-hand operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has another multitasking feature the Note 3 lacks and it's Slide Aside. You can use a three-finger swipe from the right side of the screen to add the app into the Slide Aside UI, while three finger swipes from the left will switch between the running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honestly, we find three finger gestures quite cumbersome to perform so we doubt this one will see much use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another multi-tasking boost in TouchWiz is Multi-window. It allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Chrome windows next to each other - or two different apps for that matter - side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's version of this is Dual Window. However unlike Multi window on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Dual Window doesn't allow running two instances of one and the same app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 has an ample screen not just for immersive viewing of content. The provided S Pen gives a whole new dimension to the experience. Once you pull the S-Pen out, the OS will pop up the new Air Command menu. The new menu is available everywhere throughout the UI too, you just need to press the side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Pen can be used with a myriad of provided apps. Action Memo pops up a memo on which you can write or doodle and it can be coupled with a variety of actions like calling a number you scribbled on, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap booker lets you highlight just about every part of the on-screen content and save it to your Scrapbook; Screen Write creates a screenshot of your screen and lets you write and draw on it; Pen Window allows you to open a set number of apps into a pre-selected area of the screen (using S Pen), which can help multi-tasking. Then there's S Note, which is like a personalizable diary on your Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To conclude this segment, LG and Samsung have the most feature-rich UIs on the smartphone market right now and are almost neck and neck, feature to feature. LG has done a good job of creating itw own versions of some of the features Samsung first introduced and it has further elevated and personalied the user experience with the likes of Slide Aside, Knock Code, Guest Mode and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. You decide which one looks better for you but on the feature front neither will disappoint you. In fact both instances of Android KitKat featured in this review need some to time to get used to if you want to utilize all of their features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Under the hoods of both beasts lives a quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipset with four Krait cores. They run at identical clocks, too - 2.3GHz. The Samsung Galaxy Note has an alternative version with Samsung's own Exynos 5 OCta 5420 chipset. In this comparison, we're focusing on the Snapdragon 800 version, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the same CPU horsepower, the G Pro 2 and Note 3 share the same GPU as well - the Adreno 330. There's also 3GB of RAM in both units. Yet again, this leaves the software side to decide which one is better between the two - Samsung's TouchWiz UI or LG's Optimus UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG G Pro 2 and the Galaxy Note 3 run Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box, while the ships with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. There's an official update available for the Note 3, which bumps it to Android 4.4.2 KitKat. This is the version our test unit runs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the multi-thread Linpack test, the LG G Pro 2 isn't the best performer we've seen, but still among the top achievers. However, the Galaxy Note 3 manages to sneak through and score considerably more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same story repeats in the GeekBench 3 test, where despite the decent result of the LG G Pro 2, the Note 3 takes the win.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Quadrant, both phones score similar results, making them equally matched. In AnTuTu 4, however, Note 3 scores almost 2000 points more.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now let's move on to the GPU testing. We ran GFX Benchmark T-Rex (GFX 2.7, OpenGL 2.0 test) and Manhattan (GFX 3.0, OpenGL 3.0 test) in both 1080p off-screen and on-screen, which is also the native screen resolution for the current crop of Android flagships. The G Pro 2 matched the Snapdragon 800 competition on this test, but again the Note 3 proved its might here as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Note 3 sat on top of nearly every benchmark we threw at the phablet duo. While this makes it a winner on paper, in reality both the G Pro 2 and Note 3 are equally stellar performers, which won't leave you hanging whatever you throw at them be it heavy office apps or the latest state-of-the-art graphics-intensive game.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the LG G Pro 2 is quite similar to what you get on most Android devices, including a resizable list of thumbnails. There's support for full-res images, which results in a pleasant viewing experience on the ample and sharp screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a similar layout with images divided into albums. Once you get into an album the Note 3 gives you a sidebar with all other albums. You can wipe it away and browse only the images in the selected album but the sidebar is a much appreciated alternative for faster browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices are great for enjoying your images on. The screens on each are great in terms of sharpness thanks to the 1080p resolution and ample size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an image on each you get a scrollbar on the bottom with all other images in the album. Both have Share shortcuts above the images. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 does offer varied stylus-specific interactions. You can use it to scribble and annotate on top of images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for editing the Samsung droid has many built-in options while the LG one relies on Google Photos, which also has a robust list of options and effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ample, quality screens for movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 comes with a video player that shows all videos on the device as thumbnails. Those thumbnails are static and not animated like on the Galaxy Note 3. The video playing interface offers a time scrubber, a lock function that locks the screen against accidental touches and finally, you can pull out the playlist of all videos on the side while simultaneously continuing to watch the active video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offers a list of videos with the last played video on the topmost spot in the app interface for easy access. One of things we adore about this player is that video thumbnails are animated and move while you're browsing the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both manufacturers have their instance of the pop out video originally put forth by Samsung with Pop Up Play. It lets you watch a video while still being in full control of the smartphone - browsing the homescreen or app drawer, browsing the web, etc. LG's version is dubbed Smart play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we're well aware of Samsung's Pop Up Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both players have impeccable codec support and we had no issues with either. Also both have support for subtitles, letting you choose which subtitle file you wish to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Enjoying music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and LG G Pro 2 have pretty similar music players on tap. Both sort music by artist, album, playlist and folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both have equalizers with either presets or custom adjustment. Both have 7-channel equalizers available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each phone has its own individual perks, though. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the Adapt Sound. It calibrates the sound depending on your headphones by sending a myriad of beeps in your ear to see which ones you hear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 has the ability to increase or decrease the pitch and speed of your listening experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the LG G Pro 2 both delivered splendidly clean audio output, acing both parts of our test. The only difference we measured was the slightly better stereo quality produced by the LG phablet when you plug in a pair of headphones. That advantage however is easily made up by the slightly higher volume levels of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. There's hardly anything to separate those two with the slightly higher stereo crosstalk of the Note 3 with headphones attached compensated by its somewhat louder output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the loudspeakers. In our test the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 got the better result which is pronounced in all three segments of the test - music, voice and noise sounds. The difference isn't drastic but will be audible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and video specifications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the LG G Pro 2 sport 4:3 aspect ratio 13 MP snappers with a single LED flash to back them. The sensors have an identical 1/3.06" size, the Galaxy Note 3 has a faster f/2.2 aperture compared to the f/2.4 one of the G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixels are an equal 1.1 µm in size. Focal lengths stand at 31 mm for the Note 3 and a slightly wider 29 mm for the LG phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes image stabilization. The LG G Pro 2 has the edge here with optical image stabilization plus (OIS+), which is said to boast a 20% better stabilization compared to the LG G2. The Galaxy Note 3 lacks the OIS but includes both a digital image and video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras have a variety of modes to shoot with. The Galaxy Note 3 has effects with live preview. Those effects include Cartoon, Fisheye, Sepia, Tint and more. You can download additional effects too. The LG G Pro 2 offers a basic set of Negative, Sepia and Mono without additional ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 has many shooting modes to choose from. There's Dual shot, Best photo, Best face, Sound &amp; shot, Drama, Animated photo, Panorama, Erased, Richtone HDR and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 has most of those odes covered with its own Dynamic tone (HDR), Panorama, Dual camera, Beauty shot, Shot &amp; clear, Sports and more - all of which practically mimicking those on the Note 3. There's one mode that's missing on the Galaxy Note 3 - Magic focus - it captures several shots of the same scene with different focus and then lets you do the blurred background effect (bokeh) that smartphones normally fail to produce and is more akin to higher-grade cameras. This mode is available on the Samsung Galaxy S5 so we're expecting to see it on the Note 3 sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the Normal mode the LG G Pro 2 offers a Superior Auto mode which will automatically choose the most appropriate mode to shoot in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for video - both smartphones are pretty well endowed and very much on par. There's UHD 2160p (4K) video recording at 30 fps, FullHD 1080p video recording at 30 and 60 frames per second and slow motion 120 fps 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices offer lossless 2X zoom in UHD video recording mode meaning you can zoom twice without losing any quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Audio Zoom (named this way on both devices) - using Audio Zoom the Galaxy Note 3 will enhance the sound from the object you've zoom onto in a video, while the LG G Pro 2 will altogether try cancel all other sounds coming outside of the zoomed-in subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G Pro 2. The LG G Pro 2 gets the slight advantage for the OIS+ and the Magic focus mode, which are both missing on the Galaxy Note 3. Other than that, both phablets are almost exactly the same to shoot with, offering a bulk of settings and modes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive 13MP shooters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On paper there's very little to separate the contenders we have in this review. Both sport identical resolutions and sensor sizes. The aperture numbers differ but not by much and shouldn't play such an important role in the end results. The wider focal length of the LG G Pro is slightly visible but, again, the difference is pretty minimal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally we've prepared a bunch of crops for you viewing pleasure. They represent a 100% look into samples we took simultaneously for a better side by side comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with good light. The detail levels are almost on par but the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 exhibits a sharper image. In turn it looks like the LG G Pro 2 lets less noise into the image in good light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors generally present warmer on the Note 3 but one can say they are truer to real life on the G Pro 2. There's slightly more detail in the shadows on the Galaxy Note 3's image while highlights seem the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2's tends to expose the scenes a bit higher than the Note 3 - but only barely so. You can notice the shadows and highlights are ever so slightly brighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Both devices offer a great deal of detail in good light. The Samsung phablet goes for sharper results but some might prefer the softer, more natural-looking photos of the LG G Pro 2. Our LG G Pro 2 review unit has some corner sharpness issues but this may as well be a unit-specific problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Moving onto...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High Dynamic Range</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode captures two images with different points of exposure and combines them together. It is best used in scenes with contrasty light - super bright areas and deep shadows, which the camera sensor would otherwise fail to register simultaneously successfully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you can see the difference between a normal and high dynamic range image taken with the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The darker part of the scene is much better exposed in the HDR image. The same can be said about the building in the background and the sky behind it where you can see traces out detail that are missing in the first sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the difference is pretty big making Samsung's HDR mode quite useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the LG G Pro's Dynamic Tone mode (HDR). To begin with the LG G Pro 2 chose an exposure, which privileged the darker parts of the scene to begin with, so the difference between normal and HDR mode isn't as dramatic as on the Note 3. Detail in the HDR image appears slightly softer than on the Galaxy Note 3. The building and sky in the background don't really benefit much from the multiple exposures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG G Pro 2's normal exposure is superior to that of the Galaxy Note 3 but its HDR falls slightly short compared to its competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G Pro 2. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is certainly good in brightening up the shadows, but the result is a bit washed out and less contrasty than we like. The LG G Pro 2 HDR photos have better and more natural looking shadow areas. The phones are equally good in recovering the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to low light. We captured a couple of images in low light without and with the built-in flashes. We prepared an all-round best sample from each - as you know, in low light not all shots are keepers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this scenario most of what we've said so far carries over. In the normal mode the Galaxy Note 3 goes for a sharper image, while the LG G Pro 2 offers a softer approach. The detail is almost exactly the same once again but slightly in favor of the Samsung phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the flashes are turned on the LG G Pro 2 has the advantage. Its flash is stronger and produces the more natural-looking result. Better light results in higher detail as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 produced a little more detail without a flash while the LG G Pro 2 was better with a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, both the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the LG G Pro 2 offer excellent balanced 13 MP shooters that will be great for that picture moment. Detail is plentiful on both, colors are pleasing and there are more than enough modes to go around if normal shooting isn't enough for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full resolution samples we used from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And those by the LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the normal and flash sample in low light from the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the low light normal and flash images taken with the LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Effortless 4K video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 captures videos with a slightly lower audio bitrate than the LG G Pro 2. It sits at 123 Kbps with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 2 channels (stereo). The 1080p@30fps videos of the Galaxy Note 3 have a bitrate of 17 Mbps with a solid 30 fps framerate per second. The 1080p@60fps captured 59 fps per second with a bitrate of 27 Mbps. As for the UHD video capture it sports 29 fps framerate with a very high 47 Mbps bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 videos all record audio during video capture with 2 channels (read stereo) with an audio bitrate of around 153 Kbps and a sampling rate of 48 kHz. In the standard 1080p@30fps recording mode the bitrate is almost 20 Mbps and a framerate of a solid 29 fps. The 1080p@60fps has a higher bitrate at around 30 Mbps with a solid 60 framerate. The UHD video recording has the same 30 Mbps bitrate with a 29 framerate per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So an edge in video bitrate goes to the G Pro 2 concerning 1080p videos, while the Galaxy Note 3 UHD videos carry the highest bitrate. Audio bitrate is higher on the LG smartphone resulting in cleared sound in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to actual quality. Below we've assembled a comparison crop from samples at 100% resolution. The top represents 1080p@30fps and 60fps along with a UHD sample from the Galaxy Note 3. Directly below is the corresponding LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos were shot on a tripod so as to represent the ideal shooting conditions for both cameras. While the results are very close to each other, there is noticeable sharpening on the Note 3 videos. Its results are generally sharper than those on the LG G Pro 2. This is most noticeable in the UHD crop, which has more than twice the resolution of the 1080p samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p@30fps videos generally have higher detail levels than the 1080p@60fps videos but the quality drop on the Galaxy Note 3 is lower between shooting modes compared to on the G Pro 2. The 1080p@60fps sample from the Galaxy Note 3 is almost as good as the 1080p@30fps one on the LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except for the 1080p@60fps mode, the LG G Pro 2 produces a comparable level of detail as its competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can safely say we're dealing with two of the best camcorders around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Samsung phablet has more detail in every mode we shot with and its UHD videos are still second to none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the 1080p@30fps videos from both parties below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the 60 fps 1080p samples as well. Keep in mind that YouTube plays videos at 30 fps but the added smoothness should still be visible. First comes the Note 3, then the LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then, the cream of the crop 4K videos. The Note 3's sample is first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, if you want to do some extra pixel peeping, you can go ahead and look at our dedicated video comparison tool below. Notice how the Note 3 has a much better exposure during video capture. This is most evident in the low light sample, where things appear brighter on the Note 3's video. It's also sharper, despite lacking optical image stabilization.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As another exciting phablet shootout draws to a close, it's time to look back at who did their homework better. To a great extent, the fight between the G Pro 2 and Galaxy Note 3 decides which phablet will stand as the benchmark for the rest of the Android pack to try and beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year was a good one for LG - the Optimus G Pro held the best phablet crown for nearly six months before the Note 3 came around, while the G2 will remain the best smartphone on the market at least until this year's MWC debuts start hitting the shelves. Unfortunately, supply shortages and less than stellar marketing prevented Korea's second largest manufacturer giving Samsung a proper scare and throwing a proper challenge to the number one Android phonemaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out, the LG G Pro 2 missed a chance too to take a hardware edge on the Galaxy Note 3. Coming to market a good five months later than the Note 3 is a serious advantage, but LG didn't seize it the way it did with the original Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, LG did its best to produce a worthy successor of the G Pro. The company's latest phablet is looking extra sharp and the rear-button layout is making a difference. That is, once you get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger, 5.9" display of the G Pro 2 offers more screen real estate, but doesn't match the sunlight legibility and contrast of the Note 3's 5.7" Super AMOLED panel. In terms of sharpness, there's virtually no difference as both offer superb quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phablets pack identical Snapdragon 800 configurations with the same CPU, GPU and RAM making the question of which one is faster redundant. Android 4.4.2 runs on both devices, with LG offering it out of the box on the G Pro 2, while an official update was recently made available to Note 3 users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both TouchWiz and Optimus are chock-full of both useful and gimmicky features. You are surely not going to use all of them, and even some you'll soon forget existed, but there's plenty of stuff that actually matters for the user experience. And picking between the two is more down to your aesthetic preference than anything else, as the feature sets are very evenly matched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarities continue in the camera department. Both phablets record 4K video with their 13MP cameras, the Note 3 having a slight edge in the video recording quality. Come still photography however, and it's a real tie between the two - with (LG) of without (Samsung) OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An identical 3,200mAh battery lies under the back covers of the G Pro 2 and Note 3. However, Samsung's phablet emerged from our dedicated test as the more power-efficient device with a good 10 hours more of overall endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's the S Pen stylus. It definitely gives the Note 3 a productivity edge over the G Pro 2. The degree of precision and the extra level of interaction with the device (hover, link highlight) are an added bonus to the drawing and precise editing it enables. LG has also packed a lot of cool productivity tools with the G Pro 2, but nothing that quite matches the versatility of the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the LG G Pro 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are as close as two devices from different manufacturers can get. However, having had an extra five months for development, this is hardly what the LG engineers should have strived for. And even after such a delay, they don't have enough exclusive features in response to the mighty S Pen. To make matters worse, the Note 3 has undergone a couple of price cuts (it now costs less than an 8GB iPhone 5c), so the G Pro 2 will have a hard time matching the bang-for-buck too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it appears the G Pro 2 will have to settle for those who don't need an S Pen or who are simply no fans of TouchWiz. It's not an ideal position and certainly not one LG hoped to be in but, at the rate the phablet market has been expanding, second best isn't too bad. And it's not a distant second either.</paragraph>
