			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is the proud successor to the Huawei Ascend P7, although the company seems a little apprehensive about admitting it. The Chinese manufacturer hasn't quite settled on a naming convention, dropping the Ascend moniker in this iteration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei can honestly take pride in the aesthetics of its recent creations even if the naming continuity isn't quite ironed out yet. Visually, there is no doubt that the Huawei P8 follows the gorgeous Ascend P7 and the Ascend P6, and has even managed to refine that exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal case and the slim profile carry across a distinctly premium feel. The P8 is quite an impressive package but so is its price, especially on international markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Huawei uses an in-house HiSilicon Kirin chipset and this approach can swing both ways. Ending up as the odd one out is definitely a gamble, especially away from China and we are quite keen to see how the P8 fends for itself away from home, against serial hardware and big-brand domination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8's refined exterior is actually quite sturdy, a testament to Huawei's expertise in making premium-quality handsets. No compromises have been made in this department and Huawei offers amazing build quality in the high-end segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not quite certain that the brand's name however is easily associated with the premium segment - at least in Europe, but phones such as the Ascend Mate7, the Ascend P7 and the P8 that we currently have here are definitely steps in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's custom chipsets have also failed to deliver high-end performance in the past so that's one thing we'll certainly watch closely. The HiSilicon Kirin 930 chipset seems to match the competition's chipsets architecture but only proper benchmarking will tell whether its performance matches the Huawei P8 steep price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first, let's see what hides inside the Huawei P8 exquisite retail box and we'll do a tour of the stylish exterior.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei P8<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 ships in an impressive looking box. It is one of the most-premium packages we've seen in quite a while. The box has a semi-translucent plastic cap, which hides the tightly packed stuff inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accessories and the paper leaflets are housed separate cardboard boxes, while the phone itself is safely tucked in-between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The set of accessories includes a 1A wall charger, a Huawei headset and a USB cable. The accessories themselves are not as exclusive as the box would suggest as we've seen them ship with other Huawei products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite that the presentation is indeed superb, more than matching the high price tag of the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P8 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone looks gorgeous and its design is as refined as it gets no matter what angle you look at it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the Huawei P8 does tend to take after its predecessor - the Ascend P7, but the P8 is more refined and premium in every way. The overall appearance and styling of the device bears a lot of universal appeal. We find it hard to pinpoint some element that would put off a particular group of buyers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is all-metal with a slight texture to its mat finish and feels amazing to the touch. The material also provides just enough traction to get a firm grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8 is taller, wider and heavier than the P7, which is ok, considering the bigger screen and different material choice. Yet, it is just as thin, even thinner, which is quite impressive. The exact measurements are 144.9 x 72.1 x 6.4 mm and it tips the scale at 144g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another impressive feat is that the P8 has retained its signature flush design. Nothing is protruding, the device sits flat on any surface and there is no camera hump to speak of, despite having a 13MP camera with OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not much else can be said about the choice of materials. Huawei appears to have made absolutely no compromises in this department. The attention to detail is superb. Even the small glass panel on the back of the phone has Gorilla Glass 3 protection, just like the front panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing missing from the previous generation is the glass back, but, the metal one feels like an upgrade more than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is also perfect. Unfortunately, the P8 doesn't have any official IP certification for enhanced resistance to water or dust.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls on the Huawei P8 are almost identical to those of its predecessor, the Ascend P7. The button placement is also carried over and frankly, it is quite a good choice. The device handles well and all controls are easy to reach and responsive. The handset is, however, noticeable larger than its predecessor, so, there isn't really a one to one match in the outer shell and some things have been moved around and redesigned a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One impressive thing to note about the P8 is that it stick to a minimalistic and clean design all the way. Nothing is really out of place or excessive. Starting at the front, for example, Huawei has opted for a 5.2-inch Full HD display using an IPS-NEO panel. It is a little bigger that the one in the P7 and still, the deep black bezel blurs the line between screen and frame and makes for very natural and flush look, especially when the display is off. That is if you opt for the silver or black color option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new IPS-NEO panel delivers impressively deep black levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no capacitive buttons on the front of the unit and the Huawei logo has been removed from underneath the screen, leaving behind just a simple black surface - definitely minimalistic. Huawei does, however, offer a special screen protector, which through some clever capacitive trickery adds such buttons to the frame. Quite convenient, as the OS is also aware of the said option and it turns off the onscreen navigation on request for some extra screen real-estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is not much else in plain sight on the front of the device. There is the earpiece and the 8MP front-facing camera, tightly packed next to it. There are also proximity and light sensors beside the earpiece, but they are very well concealed. There is also a very small status LED near the top right corner, but it is absolutely invisible when off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going round the device, we find the left side bare, just as it is on the Ascend P7. There are only a couple of plastic accents here, which can be found on the opposite side as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side is where the action happens. It houses a total of four controls, but doesn't feel cluttered. The volume rocker is on top, with a nice oval shape and precision cut design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below it is the power switch, which still resides in its own groove, just like on the P7. This really helps in guiding your thumb to the right place. Also, the button itself has gotten a little bigger. Metal is again the material of choice, complete with a circular, brushed pattern as a finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the button, we find two separate card slots, both sitting flush on the frame. One houses the primary nanoSIM card, while on the Dual SIM model the second tray would accept either a microSD card or a secondary nanoSIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on the top of the device. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Huawei P8 has two symmetrical grills, but only one of them houses a speaker. The main microphone is hidden under the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side is perfectly flat, without a protruding camera lens, which is becoming a rarity with flagships nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the 13MP sensor has Optical Image Stabilization system (OIS) and it still fits inside a frame that is thinner than the Galaxy S6 or the iPhone 6. Right next to it, there is a dual-tone LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thecamera lens is perhaps too close to the edge and is quite easy to cover with your fingers, but that's just nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the back is all metal with a really nice feel to it. The glass insert near the top is where the antennas are located.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is equipped with a pretty standard IPS LDS panel with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. With a diagonal of 5.2-inches, it is slightly bigger than the 5.0-inch Ascend P7. The difference, however, isn't really that noticeable, but, the P8 does give you a distinct sensation of more screen real-estate, especially if you opt for film navigation and unload a few pixels off the GUI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density is pretty good as well at 424ppi. The display uses an IPS-NEO panel, which delivers quite deep blacks for an LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has really taken the IPS-NEO technology to the next level and the P8 shows amazing levels of contrast. The blacks are so deep that one can easily mistake the panel for an AMOLED one. Brightness is also quite good. Setting its level with precision, however, is a little difficult. Dialing the brightness down quickly dims the display to near invisible levels. A more precise slider would be greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the impressive contrast, the P8 offers average sunlight visibility. It is still quite usable outside, but, we found ourselves often bumping the brightness to maximum while outdoors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P8 battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is powered by a 2680mAh battery. It is non-removable and slightly bigger than the one in the Ascend P7, although not be a whole lot. Still, the P8 really shows improvements in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company really seems to have put a lot of effort in power management and optimization, as the P8 surpasses the only average 53 hours endurance rating of its predecessor by a long shot. Hopefully, the improvements will be carried over the P7 as well with future updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an overall endurance rating of 64 hours, the Huawei P8 is hardly a champion, but, you can rely on two days of average usage on a single charge, which is adequate by today's standards. Compared to its predecessor, the Ascend P7, the phone has brought major improvement in one area in particular - web browsing. The P7 is really lacking in this department with 7:13 hours and it si good to see that Huawei has addressed this with the P8, which now scores almost double with 13:32 hours surfing the web.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video playback has also been optimized and is now a lot more power-efficient. The P8 managed to last through almost nine and a half hours of playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has implemented a great battery manager with its EMUI and provide an Ultra Power Saving mode. You can considerably improve your battery performance by tweaking the phone to your needs and preferences. Naturally we did our battery test with all energy saving options turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no support for Quick Charging or wireless charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 comes in two main flavors - the UL00 and L09, which differ in connectivity. Both come with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE support and 3G with HSDPA, with 5 bands on the UL00 and seven on the L09. This ensures up to 42.2 Mbps download speeds and 5.76 Mbps uploads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions of the P8 are also equipped with Cat. 6 LTE, capable of up to 300 Mbps downstream. The UL00 has 8 bands at its disposal, while the L09 has thirteen. As already mentioned, a Dual-SIM option is also available with the extra card sharing the slot with the microSD card, meaning you can only choose to use one of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi 802.11ac is not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei is boasting three new connectivity features called Wi-Fi+, Signal+ and Roaming+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi+ means the phone will check which Wi-Fi network in your area has the best connection speed and will connect you to it. For instance, it can switch automatically among the hotspots available in your office building, choosing the one that has the best speed. It will also keep a historical list of networks you've accessed and can even auto activate Wi-Fi when there is a known Wi-Fi network close by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Signal+ marks a dual-antenna design, which improves reception. There is one antenna at the top of the phone and another one at the bottom so there is no way you kill the signal with you grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Roaming+ means the phone will take up to 3x times less time to connect to the phone network when you are visiting another country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.1 is also on board with A2DP, EDR, and LE mode. The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB Host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The satellite navigation chip inside the phone is compatible with GPS/GLONASS and BeiDou (BDS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on board too. NFC with contactless payments is supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only connectivity feature which is missing is an Infrared blaster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface powered by Emotion UI v3.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 boots the company's own EMUI. It's the latest EMUI 3.1, which is the first iteration to be based on Android 5.0 Lollipop, instead of KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this respect, the P8 is quite the ambassador of Google's latest platform and yet, it is the similarities with previous Emotion UI versions that seem to stick out, rather than the differences. Huawei may have adopted the new core for the sake of all the performance, stability and new API improvements it brings about, but, it is still heavily customized and, on the surface, the OS has retained its signature look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Huawei has done, in a nutshell, is adopt Android Lollipop, without Google's new material design. The user interface has remained flat with almost no traces of Google's latest aesthetics. EMUI 3.1 remains true to its style and has preserved the user experience mostly intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fans will also be happy to know that the OS is still packed full of various extras and additional functions, baked right in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen features a nifty "sunshine" effect as you drag your finger across. Huawei's signature feature is the option for changing the lockscreen wallpaper automatically with beautiful images on various topics. You can also have widgets on the lockscreen, iOS-style shortcuts, and even dual clocks when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics themselves are referred to as Covers and the phone comes with quite a collection of them and a means to discover and instantly download more. They are really being treated like first class citizen with a dedicated download center, complete with channels, subscriptions and auto-updates. You can actually go in, set a few of your preferences and let the covers cycle between every screen wake, so you always have something fresh to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the bottom of the lockscreen reveals a very iOS-like quick shortcut menu. It holds a few options for controlling the covers and cycling through them, as well as shortcuts to a recorder, calculator, flashlight and the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with five customizable shortcuts, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - and at least a couple of them will be populated by the preinstalled apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is customary for Chinese Android UIs, there is no app drawer like there would be on vanilla Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone or a Xiaomi. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well. The overview mode also offers option for transition effects, wallpapers and even edit the layout grid of the panes (4x5, 5x4, or 5x5).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system and app icons, system font, system color and the sound profile. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at random or specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The theming engine is so powerful that it can basically transform the UI into and offer incredibly varied experiences. There is also quite a rich selection of styles to choose from, ranging from childish, through cartoonish and animated, all the way to minimalistic, abstract and quite serious, conservative-looking ones. And if you don't fancy any particular part of a theme or wish to create one from scratch, every single aspect is customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two pages - one that hold all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles. You can swap around the ones you want visible on the first three rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shade has undergone some degree of modification. It is now transparent and creates a blur effect underneath, quite reminiscent of iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted apps, and there's a "Clear all" button that also informs you how much memory you've freed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the P8 isn't just big on eye-candy. Huawei has invested quite a lot of effort in various usability and accessibility features and most things that are not customizable through theming can still be rearranged and moved around. The phone comes with features, such as customizable navigation bar, simple homescreen, Do not disturb mode, and even one-hand optimizations for system apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode is self-explanatory - you can schedule it when to turn on and off, and you can add a list of exceptions. And for the rest of the time, when you would like to ensure a clean and stable connection with the outside world, there is Link+. It has a smart WiFi and Mobile data switching component for stable internet, as well as a Signal+ mode for enhancing cellular connectivity when travelling on a fast moving vehicle such as a high-speed train.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various display options are also accessible on a system-wide level. The UI can be tailored to your needs and the lockscreen can be as secure as you would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>EMUI 3.1 offers granular control over app permissions and their access to various system functions, such as network data and notification areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8 features a notification center, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has given battery management an equally thorough treatment. EMUI has a dedicated interface for managing what it refers to as protected apps. The notion is that only applications that are deemed necessary by the user can be left to run in the background and consume battery and possibly network data, when the screen is off. Any app not on the list has no such privileges. This level of control is astounding ad we really wish that other manufacturers would adopt similar mechanisms to give back users granular control of their hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom navigation bar with the default Android controls is customizable - you can swap the task-switcher and back keys, or even add a shortcut for the notification area. You can hide the navigation bar and bring it back with an upwards swipe from the bottom. There is also a one-handed UI mode, for easier menu surfing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Huawei didn't stop there either and if this level of customization wasn't enough, there is an array of other advanced control methods and accessibility features as well. We already mentioned Film navigation. It is actually part of a wider section of shortcuts, which can turn the frame of your device into a customizable shortcut dock. It still requires the special screen protector film, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion control is also big on the Huawei P8. There are flip gestures, as well as picking up, tilting and more. All of those are extensively customizable to your liking as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Suspend button - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your P8 with just one hand, but if that's not enough for you, there is always the one-hand mode - it uses the accelerometer to move the keyboard, the dialer and the navigation bar to the left or right side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, if you fancy operating the P8 entirely hands-free, Speech aware has you covered. The functionality resembles what we have seen on certain Nexus and Samsung Galaxy devices and boils down to the ability to trigger a voice command, even when the phone is locked and its screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei does this by constantly listening for a "wakeup word", by default "okay emy". Once triggered, the phone wakes up and awaits further voice instructions, like placing a call. Speech awareness is also quite customizable. The wakeup phrase can be changed and you can also train the device to better recognize your voce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of accessibility features just goes on and on. Others that deserve mentioning include: glove mode, smart cover and smart headset control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the P8 Huawei added what they funnily call Knuckle sensing technology. More of a gimmick than anything else, you can use your finger's knuckle to double tap on the screen and that would create a screenshot. You can also capture only a certain are from the screen by circling it, again with your knuckle.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is powered by a home-brewed HiSilicon Kirin 930 chipset. It is equipped with a total of eight Coretex-A53 processors, four clocked at 2.0 GHz and another four at 1.5 GHz. On paper, this looks like quite an adequate setup by current standards and we can only expect the chip to perform up to par with current high-end offers by the likes of Mediatek and Qualcomm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, the real problem with the custom Kirin 930 is that it features a far-less powerful GPU than those by the competitors. The Mali-T628 MP4 is hardly a powerhouse and can potentially hurt the graphics performance of the phone significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also interesting to note that there is a version of the phone with a Kirin 935 SoC. The difference between the two, however, seems to be limited to a higher maximum clock for four of the cores - 2.2 GHz. The Mali-T628 MP4 is still on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had at least a few Huawei devices come through the office and yet, there are no other entries in our database for either the Kirin 930 or the Kirin 935. The closest we have managed to come is the Huawei Ascend Mate 7, with a Kirin 925, the Huawei Honor 6, with a Kirin 920 and the P8's predecessor - the Ascend P7, which runs on a Kirin 910T. We have included them in our comparison as reference points for how the P8 compares to the rest of Huawei's lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the other chosen competitors, the Huawei P8 happens to sit in a pretty premium cost range. With an asking price of &#x20ac;450-&#x20ac;550, the phone is not quite up to par with the current generation of flagship devices, but definitely brusher elbows with last year's top-of-the-line offers. And don't get us wrong. We can definitely justify the price, as the Huawei P8 is a textbook example of a premium device through and through. Still, performance-wise, the P8 enters into a tough crowd, but, we'll let the benchmarks do the talking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just a small note, the new EMUI 3.1 is based on Android 5.0, so, we would expect that the P8 has all the benefits that the new code brings about at its disposal. So, to be fair, we have included, where possible, Lollipop benchmark scores for any other device on the list that has already received an update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough. The eight-core Cortex-A53 setup of the P8 really does leave its competitors in the dust. Bear in mind, that most other models on the list are now close to a year old and while still quite capable, they don't have the benefit of recent ARM advancements and technologies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the LG G Flex 2 outshines the competition with its beastly Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810, but not by a whole lot. The Meizu MX4 Pro does also show admirable scores in this department, thanks to its Exynos 5 Octa 5430 SoC, despite being based on older Cortex-A15 and A7 chips. Going down the list below the P8, we see that most scores are not that far apart. There is, however, a quite observable line of improvement in the Kirin SoC generations. The Ascend P7 with its Kirin 910T is at the very bottom with almost half the score of the P8. It is followed by the Honor 6 and then the Ascend Mate 7, in the expected order. The difference between the scores of the latter is not as significant, but, it proves, without a doubt that Huawei has done a nice job designing its own chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here we see pretty much the same arrangement. Here, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha takes the cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Meizu MX4 Pro it uses an Exynos 5 Octa 5430 chipset and just like the P8, it has a slightly underwhelming Mali-T628 MP6, albeit slight better. But GPU doesn't really seem to be the defining factor in the race, seeing how the Ascend Mate 7 uses the exact same Mali-T628 MP6 model and is almost at the bottom of the chart. Optimization seems to be key and the Galaxy Alpha has proved a prime example of software done right in quite a few of our tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark OS II, which is a truly all-round benchmark. Here, we get a first glimpse of the P8 falling short in overall scores. The result is most-likely due to the already mentioned poor GPU, which drags down the otherwise excellent number-crunching power of the eight core processor setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8 still surpasses its Huawei siblings, as well as the aforementioned Meizu and Galaxy Alpha, which is still an admirable achievement. This observation is further backed up by looking at the single and multi-core performance breakdowns. Little complaints can be made about CPU performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same, however, definitely can't be said about graphics performance. Things really look bad in this department, almost catastrophic. The P8 barely churns out enough frames to be on the chart. Frankly, we expected poor GPU performance, but, there seems to be something more going on here, besides the underwhelming GPU itself. Even the Ascend P7 (1080p screen) with its Mali-450 MP4 does better than the P8 and so does the Honor 6 (1080p screen) with a Mali-T624 MP4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But perhaps, most surprising of all is that the Ascend Mate 7 (1080p screen), which uses the very same Mali-T628 MP4 still manages to outperform the P8 in terms of graphics. This leads us to believe that there might be some severe optimization issues, most-probably related to the new EMUI 3.1 and the adoption of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Hopefully, these issues will be ironed out in the future, as the poor performance is really unexpected, even for the Mali in question.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Speaking of poor OS optimization, there seems to be a lot more of it in terms of browser performance. Bear in mind, however, that the below scores are from the bundled default browser. Chrome, which is also included out-of-the-box does a significantly better job.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 benchmark performance is a mixed bag and not surprisingly, suffering from the choice of custom hardware. This, however, is only part of the story. Kirin chipsets have historically been bundled with rather meager GPU's and this one makes no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>CPU performance however is spectacular and everyday tasks are a breeze with no noticeable delay or stuttering in the UI. The 3GB of RAM without a doubt helps in this respect too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapting EMUI for the Android Lollipop has taken its toll on GPU performance, which will hopefully be fixed come future updates. Still, if you are keen on doing a lot of graphics-intensive 3D gaming, the Huawei P8 shouldn't be your first choice. For most everything else, however, the device is fluid, responsive and a pleasure to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 phonebook is laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes. It actually resides in a single application along with the dialer and messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function. Tapping on a contact brings up a popup with access to a contact's scrollable info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can input a variety of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook supports blacklist option for blocking contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 held on to signal excellently and in-call sound was just fine. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its face while it's ringing would mute the call ringing. Alternatively, picking the phone to your ear while it's ringing, automatically answers the call. A sea of other customizable gestures is also available, as already mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers. It can also be docked to one side or the other for easy accessibility, or, span the entire lengths of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the P8 through our traditional loudspeaker test and it got an Average score, even, rather on the quiet side. It still surpassed its predecessor, the Ascend P7, but, don't rely too much on hearing your ringtone at loud parties.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. Hangouts can now integrate your SMS and MMS messages in addition to Gtalk and Google+ conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8 keyboard features some additional settings thanks to its Swype integration, including themes, split keyboard modes, and keyboard height, but sadly many of them are hidden within the input settings menu rather than as shortcuts from the keyboard like on most interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is support for gestures as well as integration of Google's voice typing with their downloadable language voice recognition packs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Orderly image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 may run on an entirely new Android version, but, as already stated, MIUI 3.1 has borrowed a lot of its styling and features from its predecessor. The image gallery is one of them. IT still offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. It defaults to the Timeline view, but you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements (which detects faces automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very intuitive and packed with options, including things like filters, effects, levels and even special watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood. Every teenager would be pleased with the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it came to playing videos, the Huawei P8 default player does a good job supporting every common video codec, but unfortunately it lacks support for AC3 audio as is usually the case with most Android phone anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a way to load subtitles, but Dolby Mobile enhancement is supported. Not much else, however, is available in terms of options and the player seems kind of basic. It still works great though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your own playlists, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice little touch is the ability to filter the songs by length, so no pesky ringtones show up in your library.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed not to find RDS support - you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is excellently clean, averagely loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 showed impeccably clean output when connected to an active external amplifier - each and every one of its scores was excellent. Volume levels were only average, but not too far behind the majority of the flagship pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones didn't cause much trouble either. The only thing to degrade was stereo crosstalk and that certainly wasn't among the worst we've seen. Volume levels were again only average, but we are certainly happy with the overall performance of the slim Chinese flagship.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has a 13MP camera for maximum image resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels. There's a dual tone LED flash to go with it. The camera has F/2.0 aperture and makes use of a RGBW sensor, which reportedly delivers improved highlight rendition in high-contrast scenes and lower noise in low light. Pixel size is 1.12um, which is quite small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a very clean and simple. On the right side on each side of the virtual shutter button you get swipe controls that will take you into the photo, all focus and video modes. To activate the Burst mode you just need to press the camera shutter longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side is an advanced menu where you can choose from more shooting modes such as HDR and Panorama, and adjust things like object tracking, smile shutter, touch to capture switch, geo-tagging on/off, ISO, white balance, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do have one small grudge with the camera and the viewfinder in particular. It seems to be slightly smaller than the actual photo, which is hardly a problem, unless you are trying to frame something as precise as possible, like our sample posters, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all focus mode is similar to Refocus on the Lumia phones - your P8 takes a few pictures, while you are holding your phone steady and you can choose the focus later, including all in focus. It works nice and hiccup-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 camera captures really decent photos, with plenty of resolved detail, accurate colors and edge to edge sharpness. Surprisingly, the digital noise in broad daylight is a bit more than we would have liked but it's nothing major. Shots came out crisp and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode works great too bringing up even more detail in the shadows, without sacrificing the image quality. The effect is nice and subtle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up close, the P8 does a pretty good job of focusing as well. Here is a macro photo to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has been putting a lot of emphasis on the P8's night photography capabilities as well. The RGBW sensor is intended to help in low-light environments and the results are pretty good. We took a few shots after dark and were pleasantly surprised by the level of detail the phone picked up. Noise is also kept at bay quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make things even more-interesting, Huawei has bundled a special Light painting mode in the default camera application. It produces stunning results. No matter how long you take to complete your creation, the rest of the scene seems to stay clear and sharp and doesn't change exposure. Here is some light art we made ourselves (we're not terribly good with this as you can tell). Interestingly, it makes a mirrored image so you can write in front of the camera and the words come out readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Light trails mode, which operates much like the Light Painting but doesn't reverse images. It captures the scene with the correct exposure and from there it keeps adding the light trails of the passing cars for as long as you like without any risk of overexposing the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei P8 takes high-res panorama images, with great stitching, excellent contrast and very good detail levels. It is among the best devices we would pick for panorama purposes, just like the Ascend Mate7 before it, bested only by the Apple iPhone 6 series. Here are samples in both orientations.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has plenty of smartphones to contend with in our Photo compare tool, which lets you see just how it fares against other 13MP shooters. We've placed it up against its cousin, the Ascend Mate7, to see if there is any noticeable improvement.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 offers 1080p videos at 30fps. Sadly, there's no 4K recording, although the hardware seems more than capable to handle it. There is a dedicated viewfinder for clips and, unlike the photo one, it seems to match up with the actual field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as MP4 files and have a bitrate of around 10Mbps for 1080p resolution, 12 Mbps at most. There's stereo sound at 96Kbps, but the framerate varies quite a bit, but generally stays closer to 29fps than to the pivotal 30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison the Ascend Mate7 put out a solid 25Mbps 1080p video at 30fps form its 13 MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result of the reduced bitrate, videos taken with the Huawei P8 are quite lacking in detail and sharpness. Once again - the dynamic range could have been better and we really expected more resolved detail from such a premium phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here a sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a 1080p@30fps untouched video (11s ~ 13MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's another one from the build-in Time-lapse feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 might not shoot the best video around, but it still did quite well in our comparison test. Bear in mind, that a future update might very well fix this, as, after all, EMUI 3.1 is Huawei's first go at adopting Android 5.0. Once Lollipop starts spreading to the rest of the product lineup, the camera situation on the P8 will perhaps be revisited. Until then we can hardly recommend it based on video recording qualities alone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droids nowadays, the Huawei P8 comes with two browsers to handle your web surfing needs. The stock browser offers largely the same functionality as Google's bundled Chrome browser, but we found the latter to be a more capable performer. Chrome also lets you sign in with your Google account and access open tabs and history from other sessions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Huawei's homebrewed apps is the Phone Manager. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's quite a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 comes with Polaris Office, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations. It comes with a very useful Safe folder, for protected storage. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has included some nifty camera features in the Huawei P8, some of which are accessed as individual apps. The Magnifier is especially nifty for looking at stuff up close, while the markedly female-targeted Mirror apps lets you get a quick look at yourself, with included brightness adjustments and zoom options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standards, such as notes, calendar, world clock with stopwatch and timer and a calculator. Nothing really special to point out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Huawei P8 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Almost no traces of material design were found, despite Google's latest Android version running underneath</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is exquisitely made and can easily compete in the big leagues. The handset meets the club's dress code and carries a matching price tag. That, of course, means the performance bar's been set quite high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company indeed succeeded in producing a high-end device. Aluminum alloy secures the premium looks, matched by excellent handling. The P8 will get your attention and the build quality won't disappoint in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the inside, the custom Kirin 930/935 SoC is actually capable of a big enough bang, but the Mali-T628 MP4 that Huawei stubbornly insists on is underwhelming. The new EMUI 3.1 definitely looks good on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop and offers a number of advanced features, but the overall performance just isn't flawless. This is hardly noticeable in the GUI or in everyday tasks, but some more-advanced applications and elaborately detailed games are sure to take their toll on performance. Video recording seems to have some issues as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, these shortcomings are far from a deal breaker for the majority of likely users. Hopefully, the OS performance will be tweaked up with a couple of updates, allowing the device to make proper use of its capable hardware. Other than that, there is a lot Huawei deserves credit for. The 5.2-inch IPS NEO display is gorgeous with nice vivid colors and blacks almost as deep as on an AMOLED unit. The 3GB of RAM provide ample room for multitasking and the 13MP camera is definitely up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick summary of our key test findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Huawei P8 is a solid device all-round, but the fact remains that its hefty price tag puts it in a tough company. The asking price might not be 2015 flagship grade, but perhaps enough to get you almost any of last-year's top-of-the-line models. And there's no shortage of viable contenders to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off at Samsung, ?550 might not get you a Galaxy S6, but it's more than enough for a Galaxy S5. The ex-flagship boasts a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, with the same FullHD resolution and Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood, there is a much more-conventional Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, coupled with an Adreno 330 GPU, which might be slightly aging, but can still breeze through almost anything you throw at it. The 16MP camera is also arguably better and you do get fingerprint and heart-rate sensors, a barometer, Qi-wireless charging and the advanced TouchWiz features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fancy something more recent, a couple of other Galaxy devices deserve to be mentioned. The Galaxy A7 is the top offer from Samsung's new metal line. Opting for it, you don't have to sacrifice the premium materials of the P8. Feature-wise it is not as rich as the S5, there have been some cuts in hardware to facilitate the premium build without ramping up the price. Still, you get a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, 2GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 615 middle-class SoC or Samsung's own Exynos 5 Octa 5430.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another, quite similar offer is the Galaxy Alpha. It costs just about as much as the A7, perhaps even a few bucks less. For that, you still get a premium metal frame, a smaller 4.7-inch screen with a 720p resolution and the same Exynos 5 Octa 5430 with 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy A7 ? Samsung Galaxy Alpha</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also has a couple of interesting offers in the same price range as the Huawei P8. You can actually pick up the extremely popular LG G3. Last year's flagship is still an impressive piece of tech. It boasts a 5.5-inch True HD-IPS screen with a resolution of 1440 x 2560. It does have some shortcomings in terms of colors and contrast, but at 538 ppi it is a glorious and crisp experience. The rest of its specs include a Snapdragon 801 SoC and 2GB or 3GB of RAM, depending on the version, accompanied by 16GB or 32GB of on-board storage. The 13MP main shooter with dual-tone flash is also arguable better than the one on the Huawei.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another LG device, this time form January this year, also deserves some attention. It is the G Flex2. Its signature feature is undoubtedly the 5.5-inch Curved P-OLED Full HD display, so if you are into curvy panels it is definitely a good alternative. It also offers a few hardware upgrades over the G3. Inside is a top of the live Snapdragon 810 SoC with an Andreno 430 GPU. It also comes in the two memory variants that the G3 offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G3 ? LG G Flex2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of viable ex-flagships continues with the Sony Xperia Z3. After the Z3+ was made official recently, it is now a lot more-affordable and fits the price range. Some of its features include a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS display, just like the Huawei P8. The devices are also comparable in size, although the Sony is noticeably thicker. Still, is does come with a Snapdragon 801 SoC, 3GB of RAM and let's not forget, the signature IP68 certification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is also on the list. Yet another legendary device. IT has become synonymous to metal unibody design and still has a lot to show. Its dual 4MP camera setup definitely distinguish it from most other devices and with its other internals quite similar to the ones in the Z3, it is yet another solid performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia Z3 ? HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 is a handsome device and built to high standards. Its stylish exterior and premium feel will get it quite a lot of attention. The P8 is well equipped too and is sure to please the majority of Android users, who value quality exterior and rich functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you are keen on specs and would like to squeeze every last drop of processing power out of your handset, the Huawei P8 shouldn't really be your first option. Its price tag, which by the way we wouldn't call unjustified, throws it right in the midst of a hostile crowd. The truth is you can pick up a more versatile device for the price, but you would have to look pretty hard to find one that is nearly as stylish.</paragraph>
