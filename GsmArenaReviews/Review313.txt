			<paragraph>The Nokia N81 8GB is a truly exciting smartphone combining the power of Symbian 9.2 OS spiced up with the new N-Gage platform. What we have in N81 8GB is entertainment and multimedia unleashed. Not only does its specs sheet impress, but it promises tons of fun. With that said you cannot blame us for being too eager to test it out, can you? So please make yourselves comfortable and join us for this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you all know, there are two versions of the handset - standard and 8GB. The standard version features a memory card slot, the other has none but offers the exciting 8GB of onboard memory. We are looking at the Nokia N81 8GB but all of it holds true for the standard Nokia N81 as well. Therefore, from now on we are going to simply call it Nokia N81.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions of Nokia N81 have been in the spotlight ever since their official announcement at the Nokia Go Play Event in London back than in August. The air is getting thick with anticipation, as N81 seems to have earned quite a lot of fans. No wonder with a specs sheet like this, though we know better than taking anything for granted. After all, the question is whether performance cashes the checks written by the specs. Besides, we just couldn't wait to play a few games and see if those dedicated keys are worth the fuss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A word of warning is due as our review is based on a beta version of the handset it's possible that the retail version will have some minor changes. But enough chit-chat, you are welcome on the Nokia N81 tour right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N81 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian goes flat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N81 is about the size of most other Finnish smartphones. It stands at 102 x 50 x 17.9 mm, which is almost identical to Nokia 5700 XpressMusic or Nokia 6110 Navigator. No need to fuss over a millimeter or two. The difference in weight however can't be overlooked, with the N81 weighing 15 grams more than the recently reviewed Navigator and good 25 grams more than the 5700 XpressMusic smartphone. Even Nokia's top multimedia device - the omnipresent N95 - is as much as 20 grams lighter. Not that it's too much of an issue, but there are a lot of people who don't want such a load in their pocket. In any case, the phone will be hard to squeeze in tighter pockets and, if dimensions are the most decisive factor when buying a phone, you will probably have to look elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, the handset is of solid build, with high-quality sturdy materials used on the casing. The slider construction also seems very reliable though it somewhat lacks smoothness. All in all - the phone is a typical Nokia in that aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the Nokia N81 front panel, at the top right corner is the video-call camera. Dead center at the top of the front side is an oblong plate with the earpiece right in its middle. The plate serves as a dual key (rocker) with the two gaming buttons on each of its sides. Invisible when not in use, the dedicated gaming buttons backlight in environments where they can be used. Under the gaming keys is the sparkling 2.4" display. It supports 16M colors and has a QVGA resolution. Offering stunning picture quality, the display ranks among the best even by Nokia's standards. Under the screen come a whole bunch of controls in what seems the most crowded of D-pads. The Navi Scroll key is the central element. It is truly unique for two reasons. Firstly, it offers the exceptional Navi wheel navigation and, secondly, its confirming center is very hard to press. This may sound unbelievable, especially given its ample size. In fact, it has to be pressed exactly in the center, otherwise the cursor will move before confirming. We did have some trouble with it and we have little hope that it's going to be fixed in the retail version. On the other hand, the Navi wheel is doing a truly amazing job but more on that later in the review. The square Navi Scroll key is framed within a larger pad with the four dedicated music keys at its angles. On the periphery of this frame-within-frame layout are the two soft keys (top), and the Menu key and Clear key (bottom). At the sides of the D-pad are the Call and End keys, placed on the sloping edges of the handset's front. Finally, on the right side of the scroll key we find the last control: the silver multimedia key. It has the same functionality as in Nokia N95 - opening a dedicated multimedia menu, which has been redecorated and is now looking even better and more convenient to use. Except for the multimedia key and the frame of the scroll key, all other buttons are completely flat. Regardless of their touch-sensitive disguise, they are actually regular hardware keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals the numeric keypad, which just happens to be one of our greatest disappointments with Nokia N81. The keypad is entirely flat with almost undetectably thin lines separating each row of keys. If you had any hope of typing on Nokia N81 without constantly looking at you fingers, you'll be vastly disappointed. The keys themselves are quite large but still fail to resolve the usability issues of this keypad. Built on the concept of a new gaming experience, the N81 will likely attract the young and it is not the smartest decision by Nokia to make the phone so texting unfriendly. After all, SMS is key to exactly this age group, which the N81 seems to be targeting and keen texters wouldn't appreciate having to put so much effort into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the handset we find one of the two stereo speakers at the top, the volume rocker right below it, and the dedicated camera key at the bottom end. The volume rocker is a bit too hard to press but our guess is that's a unit-specific problem of out beta handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other stereo speaker is symmetrically placed on the left side. This is a nice layout of the stereo speakers, as it prevents them from being muffled when the phone is laid on a table or when held in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Topside we find another thing that is a real rarity in Nokia phones - the lock switch. This is truly a convenient control, as it replaces the well known two-key combination with a single slide. Next to the lock switch is the 3.5 mm standard audio jack allowing use of regular headphones with your Nokia N81 for better sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom side of the handset, we come across four apertures there: the mouthpiece, microUSB slot, the charger plug and the neck/wrist strap eyelet. Is seems microUSB is becoming a standard in all recent Nokia models and is gradually replacing the miniUSB used in the models of the previous wave. The main reason for this is that microUSB is obviously more space-efficient than miniUSB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is quite plain, holding the Nokia N-series label and the 2-megapixel camera lens with LED flash only. We are still wondering why Nokia decided to go for a 2 megapixel camera module instead of at least a 3 megapixel cam. Auto focus would have been nice too. Upon removing the back panel, we find the battery. Nokia N81 is equipped with a Nokia Li-Ion 1050 mAh BP-6MT battery. We were quite satisfied with the power supply of our unit, which generally lasted about three days in moderate usage, while Nokia is promising up to 410 h of standby time or up to 4 hours of talk time. Expected music playback time is rated at 11.5 hours, while promised gaming time is up to 6 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery is the SIM card holder. It is quite difficult to operate, as you have to pull it out with your fingernail, to insert or remove the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up our impressions of Nokia N81 design and construction, we have to say that apart from the few flaws we have already pointed out, we are pleased with the phone. The use of quality materials benefits both the phone's sturdiness and design. On the other hand, the glossy front and back panels do tend to attract fingerprints, so keeping Nokia N81 clean is quite a time-consuming job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is strong and even, which greatly helps operating the phone in dark environments. However, lighting around the edges is very uneven, which spoils the refined and sophisticated look of the handset. It looks like a manufacturing blunder and may really be one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have to mention that the phone is nice to hold and one-hand and two-hand operation are equally comfortable. Except for the D-pad that is, mainly because its confirming center is hard to press correctly in single-handed operation. You really need one hand for holding the handset firmly and the other for precise aiming.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Picture perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we speak about phones, a 2.4" inch display is well worth a praise. With N81 and the N-Gage gaming experience it offers, the 2.4" display with 16M colors and QVGA resolution seems the spot-on choice. The display on Nokia N81 has great sunlight legibility, incredible picture quality and is large enough for everyone to see. You can hardly want any more even in this price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ring, ring?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before everything else a mobile phone should be good at making and receiving calls. After all, N-Gage or not, you'll eventually hold these gadgets up to your ear. Luckily, with Nokia N81 signal reception is on the familiar high level.Sound during calls is crystal clear, with no interferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia N81 stacks against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It is definitely not the loudest phone around. You can find more information about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian with a pinch of fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N81 is running on Symbian 9.2 OS and uses the well known S60 3rd edition graphic user interface. The improved Feature Pack 1 is no news anymore, as all recent Nokia smartphones are equipped with it. Among the strong points of the FP1 is the availability of multiple alarms, as well as the voice memo limit increase to a whole hour. Furthermore, it displays blue circles on running applications' icons to remind you to turn them off when you don't need them any more. No one wants used up RAM to slow down their smartphone. All that said, we need to mention that Nokia N81 is armed with the fastest Nokia processor to date (ARM 11, 369 MHz). The same CPU powers the Nokia 6120 Classic and Nokia 5700. Navigating the menus is very fast. All the commands are executed in an instant, which greatly contributes to the impression N81 leaves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of course features an active stand-by mode. You have a bar of shortcut icons for instant access to pre-selected functions at the top of the display, and scheduled events from the calendar together with tasks underneath. When selecting the shortcuts, you can choose any application or even a website. The functionality of the two soft keys is configurable too. There is also a line on the active standby display reserved for the currently running track or radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an offline mode, switching off all transceivers but allowing the use of the other features of the device. It is the default profile if you start the handset without a SIM card. The offline mode allows full access to the functions of the phone that do not require cellular network coverage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any S60 smartphone, the task manager pops up upon a longer press on the Menu key. It allows switching between applications or turning off any running application by pressing the Clear key. The four different main menu views are becoming standard for Nokia smartphones. The traditional options are the well known grid and list view. The more unusual looks are the V-shape and Horseshoe, which are somewhat uncomfortable to use. That, of course, is our subjective opinion and nobody is obliged to subscribe to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much to our disappointment, the touch sensitive Navi wheel functionality cannot be used for browsing the menu. We do find the Navi wheel a brilliant navigation solution. Pity, Nokia developers decided to limit its functionality to the gallery, music player and multimedia menu only. The Navi wheel is really fast and fun way of finding your way around menus. The only flaw it has is that it probably makes the D-pad confirmation center even tougher to press without changing your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia menu is where the Navi wheel has its potential unleashed. The menu can be started from anywhere by pressing the dedicated key and provides quick access to the multimedia features of Nokia N81. It is similar to the one in Nokia N95 but with a changed look and some added functionality. For example, the icons are changed to tabs with submenus for each tab, which greatly facilitates access. You can even rearrange the icons to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all recent Symbian smartphones, there is also a voice recognition feature. It's used for both starting applications and dialing contacts. It is not voice dependant, and doesn't require pre-recording of the commands. Voice recognition on N81 is OK with most of the commands, but still falls short of Nokia N95 or Nokia 6110 Navigator. Who knows, this may change with the retail version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Looking N-series<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the phone's looks, you can always pep them up by changing the theme. There are 5 preinstalled themes on Nokia N81, all named Nokia N-series. The absence of the standard Nokia theme is no surprise, as we're dealing with an N-series gadget. There is no limit however to themes you can add to an N-series device. Nice themes are downloadable for free or for a token price all over the internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical of Nokia smartphones, there are 5 predefined ringing profiles, along with the already mentioned Offline mode. This count is just enough for dealing with virtually any situation. If you still find the number inadequate, you can always create new profiles or modify the existing ones to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook knows no boundaries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Symbian phonebook, the one in Nokia N81 offers more than anyone would ever need to use. It has virtually no limit to either the number of entries or fields for each contact. Technically, all the available memory can be used on that. Though it's difficult to even imagine having that many contacts, isn't it? The contacts can be ordered by first or last name, depending on the user's preferences. Naturally, they can also be searched by gradual typing of the desired name. The phone will search in both first and last name fields, as well as additional names in those fields. This means that even if a contact has a more intricate name, you will have no problem finding it provided you remember at least a part of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can select from a huge number of preset fields, which you can repeat as many times as you like. Even if a contact has more mobile phones than pockets, you are still going to have a spot for each of the numbers. Plus, if you happen to need a field that doesn't exist, you can always use one of the existing ones and simply rename it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log department has always been a strength of all smartphones and Nokia N81 is no exception. It contains three tabs for dialed numbers, received and missed calls, which are able to hold up to 20 call records each. Furthermore there is a log application that stores all the calls, messages and data transfers for the past 30 days. The storage period can be shortened if you are low on space, but that is very unlikely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You've got mail?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are a person who likes to send lots of messages, then Nokia N81 is likely to get on your nerves. With the dead flat keypad and the lack of substantial tactile feedback mentioned you just can't help it. There is no way you are going to type as quickly as on Nokia 5700 for example. Still, not all is lost in this aspect, as Nokia N81 is doing great in terms of software at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor is the well know intuitive application for all Symbian S60 smartphones. It has a counter of the characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending. It goes without saying that a delivery report can be activated. The reports pop up on the standby screen when the keypad is unlocked, and are consequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor offers to either save it to the drafts folder or delete it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor is almost identical to the one just described. The only noticeable difference is the addition of a subject line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is also an audio message editor. If, by any rare chance, you want to create an audio message you might be pleasantly surprised with Nokia N81. The editor can either record the message right away or use a previously recorded sound clip. We can't help ourselves but wonder if this application will ever be put to use but, who knows? After all, MMS also supports sending sound clips, so the audio editor does nothing other than double a part of its functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client won't surprise anyone who has ever used a Symbian powered phone. It can download headers only, as well as the whole messages. There is also support for attachments, so Nokia N81 can meet almost any requirement regarding the user emailing needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our overall impression is that Nokia N81 is great for receiving all kinds of messages but not that good for sending them. That holds especially true if sending involves typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Navi wheeling the music player.<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player looks exactly like on other Symbian 3rd edition devices. At least, that's what you may think when you first look at it. The Navi wheel however gives it a real kick. Other than that, there are no changes regarding functionality. In fact, we don't believe it needs any. As usual, there is support for a huge number of audio formats including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA. The M3U playlists are also managed flawlessly and files are automatically added to the music library once downloaded to the phone. Tracks can easily be transferred to the phone via Bluetooth, USB or by simply downloading them from the internet. Upon completing a USB transfer, the phone automatically prompts scanning for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navi key is active in the music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets, which is a respectable count. If it still seems not enough to you, new ones are created in a matter of seconds and modifying the existing is just as easy. Same as with Nokia N76 or Nokia 5700, the music player of Nokia N81 cannot be switched off once it is started. It seems as this is becoming a standard with all new Nokia handsets and we really cannot help wondering why Nokia would force the users to have an unwanted program running in the background and consuming precious RAM. Still that's the way it is and we just have to live with it. With this phone, even the amazingly complicated jump-through-thousands-of-menus-until-you-can-exit pattern that worked on Nokia 5700 for example, won't do. Anyway, another thing to mention is that the phone also has a support for the A2DP Bluetooth profile. This means that you are able to play your favorite tracks on stereo Bluetooth headphones. We had no problems pairing Nokia N81 with third party Bluetooth headphones, and we guess the phone is perfectly compatible with almost any headset that can come your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N81 also features Real player and Flash player. The video player automatically displays the videos in landscape or portrait mode depending on their aspect ratio. You can also switch to full screen to make better use of the large display. When in fullscreen, the softkey functions are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing experience and only pop up when a key is pressed. Topped with the great picture quality and the generously sized display, playing videos is a charm with Nokia N81, indeed. As far as the Flash player is concerned, there is nothing special to note - it does the job it's meant to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the preinstalled content on your Nokia N81, you can always turn the radio on for a breath of fresh tunes. The FM radio automatically scans and saves the available stations in your area. We would have preferred RDS support, but it's not that much of a letdown.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being able to listen to your favorite tracks is one thing but playing them properly is completely different. We were more than glad to realize that Nokia N81 is good at both. Our audio quality test showed very good results and convinced us that Nokia N81 is a real step forward for Nokia in this aspect. It is way better than Nokia 7500 Prism, which we recently tested. The Nokia 6110 Navigator worthies nowhere near such a comparison. More details about the test itself here. And there go the results, so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery - N-series in its element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical N-series gadget, Nokia N81 is particularly strong in the gallery. The application is even better now, with the cool looks of the 3D rotating gallery enhanced by the Navi wheel functionality. This really makes browsing your pictures and videos on Nokia N81 a sheer pleasure. Switching between photos and videos by means of the Navi wheel is possible both in the gallery and when viewing a single picture. Furthermore you can zoom in and out of pictures with the two keys above the display, which is a great solution, saving some time and clicks. The zooming itself can be up to 8x revealing great detail but this is no news in Symbian phones. In fact, the only change to the functionality of the gallery is that it cannot be switched to portrait mode. This is kind of strange if you ask us, though no obstacle to usability in fact. Plus, the whole browsing and zooming thing is so quick and responsive that we can forgive almost anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Gallery with the Navi wheel and zooming with the gaming keys above the display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers great file-management functionality, allowing selecting and sending of multiple files at a time. In addition to that, the usual Symbian file manager is also at hand. Finally, there is an application manager to take care of the installed applications on Nokia N81. Not much to talk about here, as it is identical to the one in any other Symbian device. Its functionality boils down to providing details about installed applications, removing them and keeping a log on movements in both directions. It also has a shortcut to the Nokia download center, where loads of content for your mobile phone are to be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily the very useful "Search" application is also present in Nokia N81. Of course it's available at the download center for free, but it is nice of Nokia to have saved us the effort. The "Search" itself finds almost every item in your Nokia containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every chunk of data is checked and then shown to the user if it matches their demands.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera reduced in rank<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's astonishing that Nokia has decided to integrate a 2 megapixel fixed focus camera into the Nokia N81, instead of trying to close the gap in the three megapixel race. But let's leave our frustration aside and continue the camera test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks identical to the one found in the Finnish multimedia flagship Nokia N95. The camera options are shown with small icons near the lower end of the screen. These can be hidden to make full use of the display as a viewfinder. The main camera only shoots in landscape mode which is easily explainable by the position of the dedicated camera key. Besides, it feels far more natural to take pictures this way. Camera settings are identical to the one on Nokia N95 with one nice addition - grid lines can now be added to the viewfinder. You can use them to help compose your snapshots like a pro - the photography rule-of-thirds is that you should place your main subject either along these lines or at the points where they intersect. The rule-of-thirds also applies to landscape shots. There you should have the sky occupying either one third or two thirds of the frame. The other change made goes without saying - macro mode is not present due to the lack of autofocus on Nokia N81. Luckily the customizable ISO settings, white balance and scene modes are still present. Finally we need to mention that the dedicated camera button could be a bit bigger and easier to press. As it is with this phone, you either need to look at it or spend a few seconds finding it with your fingertips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of Nokia N81 is just what you would expect from a 2 megapixel Nokia camera - slightly below average for that pixel count. We were full of high expectations at first, as the display showed great previews of the pictures taken. However, when they were downloaded a whole bunch of flaws became visible. The noise levels are acceptable, but the photos in general look somewhat as watercolor paitings. You can also seen some strange color blotches in the shadow areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary camera can also be used for taking pictures. It is quickly accessed through the camera interface and can be used as a quick and convenient way to make self-portraits or contact images. It is also capable of recording video but that will most probably turn out unusable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the video recording of the main camera, it can shoot in QVGA resolution at 15 fps. Although this is a decent achievement to say the least, the quality is not that impressive. Just don't be fooled by Nokia.com specifications, where they state the Nokia N81 8GB can record VGA videos - it's obviously a mistake.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Get yourself connected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is definitely among the Nokia N81 priorities. A microUSB port is in charge of cable connections. If you do not have the required cable, you can always rely on Bluetooth v2.0 or Wi-Fi. In addition, there is a rich choice of network selections - GPRS, EDGE and UMTS are all present. We felt sorry that HSDPA has been missed out this time, but we could live with it, having all those alternatives at hand. The N81 8GB lacks a card slot too but, as we see it, card readers are rarely used for transferring data from and to a mobile, so it is not a big deal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>N-series on the internet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know what we think of Nokia smartphone browsers - they are simply great. The large display makes things even better. Even the most elaborate web pages fit on the screen and look just like on PC. There is the mouse cursor, which can be operated through the D-pad. As usual, it works great and is very easy to control. A semi-transparent mini-map of the page appears on the screen when scrolling. The mini-map can also be accessed for faster scrolling by pressing the "8" key. You can zoom in and out on the page using the "*" and "#" buttons. Naturally, all those functions are also available in the options associated to the left selection key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing is very fast and even complex pages didn't cause any slowdowns in scrolling or zooming. The browser also handles Flash objects and Java scripts with ease. All-in-all, it's another great job from Nokia. The large screen of Nokia N81 adds up to a remarkable result.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Being organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coming to the organizing options, we find another of Nokia N81's good sides. It has, as you might have expected, the whole package of organizer applications and features of Symbian S60 phones. The calendar has Month, Week and Day views. The four events you can schedule in the calendar are: Meeting, Anniversary, Memo and To-do. All of those have their own unique fields and settings allowing even further customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications however aren't as many as we would have liked on Nokia N81. The Quickoffice is missing, and so is the ZIP manager. At least the PDF reader is present but we do hope that in the retail version more of the office applications will be loaded. Else, you'll have to go to Nokia's download center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, a converter, calculator and voice recorder are available, as well as the Notes application. They offer the usual decent functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>N-gage gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N81 will come with three preinstalled games. All of them are based on the new N-gage platform and even the demo versions promise a pleasant pastime. The keys above the display also contribute to the improved gaming experience. You can take a look at our videos for a feel of the games on N81. At this stage purchasing the full games from the N-gage site is not yet available but it's expected to start in the nearest future. Then we'll also know what a game would cost to buy. It is sure however, that these games will excel at both graphics and interface and, as the list of expected titles shows, there will be something for everyone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Game over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Reviewing the Nokia N81 was fun, except for the short periods when it got on our nerves with its awkward D-pad. Having in mind that some of its disadvantages will be fixed, we think a strong and able Symbian device is joining up the ranks. A screen of this size is not so often seen, while its gaming powers add up to a really exciting gadget. There's no doubt however that the N81 is quite a niche product, even if it's not as outspokenly eccentric as its N-gage siblings. It's worth considering how many people will be tempted by the rich smartphone functionality and turned down by the excessively youthful image of the gaming-happy N81. The hefty price tag is no surprise but it may cause many to think twice before choosing a Nokia N81 over N95 for example. If you ask us, we'll definitely go for the N95, never mind its inadequate battery. Plus, the N81 is the game-centered device in the N-series, but many of its teammates are compatible with the N-gage games anyway.</paragraph>
