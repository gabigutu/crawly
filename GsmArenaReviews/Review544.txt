			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>150g of polycarbonate and 5 inches of a full-HD screen. Amazing what they'd call a mini these days. Technically, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is the compact version of the bezel-free Z9 but size isn't the first thing that sets these two apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in display diagonal is minor and both have 1080p resolution, which means the 5-inch mini has a tad crisper screen. The battery capacity is the same, which is also a point in the Nubia Z9 mini's favor. A memory card slot is another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But well, there's probably no way to break the bad news gently, so there we go. No edge-to-edge display for the Nubia Z9 mini. Other than that, the two look nearly identical and that's a compliment to the mini, which uses plastic where the bigger Z9 had glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, there're more positive side effects of that than negative. For starters, the mini is a good 50g lighter and the rear cover opens to a microSD card slot, which the superior phone didn't get. The mini is more customizable too via a number of optional back covers that can be purchased separately at less than $30 each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inevitable hardware downgrades have helped the Z9 adjust its price to fit the midrange bracket. With a tag of around $300 though, it has quite a bunch of rivals to take on, especially in Europe and America where ZTE's exposure and brand-awareness are still developing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the phone is not without its merits so we'd be foolish to write off its chances. The signature black and red exterior stands out and the software does have a few interesting custom features as well. Equipment-wise, the Z9 mini goes by the midrange book and is genuinely trying to over-deliver where it can without blowing the budget. It is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 SoC, along with 2GB of RAM. A reliable camera, LTE, the latest Android and expandable memory are among the major highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is trying to make its way through a crowd of midrangers which can turn hostile to ambitious newcomers. ZTE knows it needs to raise its profile in the developed markets and the Nubia line is at the spearhead of their campaign. Without the edge-to-edge screen, the mini is counting on the eye-catching exterior and the novelty factor to lure users away from the big name rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Proper localization should be an important part of that effort, as at the moment the Nubia Z9 mini is entirely geared towards the Asian markets and even our test unit is missing the standard Android services. This is not unusual for Chinese handsets but ZTE had better be working on language and software versions if it wants to carry some of its momentum over to Europe and America.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us to the next page to see the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini getting unboxed and posing for some close-ups.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini surely arrives in style. It comes in a spacious and lavish two piece cardboard box, in the signature black and red colors. The box is not as premium as the Z9's with its hard cover, but clearly not your average phone package either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contents are set on two levels. The phone itself is on top and underneath are the accessories. Unlike the Z9, which comes with a premium headset, the mini version only has a 1.5A charger and a thin red USB cable that matches the general color scheme. There is a Nubia sticker thrown in and a single extra item, a screen protector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not sure whether it will be in every package, but is definitely a necessity, considering the lack of protective screen coating on the phone. However, the fact that it is clearly an after-market solution with an image of an iPhone on the package does take away some from the otherwise tastefully executed packaging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Nubia Z9 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you can get past the overall size of the unit, the Z9 mini is quite attractive. The all black exterior with a light alloy frame and red accents looks extra sharp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Similarities between the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini and the bezel-less Z9 are by no means accidental. Of course, creating the Z9 mini involved a lot of compromise but the general look and feel is intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia Z9 and Z9 mini have a distinct styling of their own with slick dual-tone exterior and subtle but efficient red accents. The Z9 mini has lost the alloy frame of its senior sibling and glass on the back has been swapped for plastic. The reduced weight is welcome, plus it's a removable and customizable cover. ZTE has managed a nice finish too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 141.3 x 69.8 x 8.2mm, it's only a mini in name. It would've been unreasonable to expect much less from a 5-inch handset. 147g is acceptable weight, a definite improvement over the 192g of the original Nubia Z9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia Z9 mini is a stylish device, one that will stand out among midrange rivals, of which there are plenty. Although not particularly slim, the design is flush all around with nothing protruding bits such as a camera bump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some extra protection would have been appreciated on the front and the plastic back cover does look a little fragile as well, especially when detached.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls on the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini are almost identical to the Z9's. Buttons are laid out conveniently and everything is within comfortable reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single most notable difference between the Nubia Z9 pair isn't in the mini's favor. The bezel-free look aside though, the mini is doing most things right. For starters, it has a microSD slot - a dedicated compartment too, as opposed to sharing a slot with one of the SIM cards, which is the popular solution. The stand-alone memory card slot is perhaps the main reason for the Z9 mini to have a removable back cover and ZTE didn't miss the customization opportunity either. Exchangeable covers are available for around $30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users also get access to the battery which is officially non-removable but seems to be held in place by a small cover and a few screws. There is a seal that needs to be broken on one of the screws, but replacing the battery is not entirely ruled out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z9 mini has capacitive Menu and Back buttons, but no indication which is which - tiny dots are only visible when the screen is lit up. It's actually up to you - the two navigation keys can be swapped around in the settings. The home key has a red frame, which matches the camera accent on the back and ties together the whole design concept.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is not much else to note at the front other than the earpiece and the 8MP selfie camera. The proximity and ambient light sensors are very well concealed. There is also a tiny status LED in the top corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the SIM cradle only. It requires a pin to eject and sits flush when closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side has a total of two buttons - a volume rocker above power/lock button. Both are within comfortable reach. The frame looks quite like the one on the Nubia Z9, but isn't made of metal, the same goes for the buttons. Still, the plastic has an impressive finish that can be easily confused for the real thing, especially from a distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed at the top of the device. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Z9 mini is laid out quite differently from the Z9. The microSD port is placed in the far right with a tiny microphone hole next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the far left side there is a single speaker. Like we already said, this arrangement is far from typical, but at least the Z9 doesn't leave you guessing if it has stereo speakers or not, like the Z9 with its symmetrical grilles on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side is perfectly flat, without a protruding camera lens. Like the rest of the exterior, the back of the Z9 mini is quite similar to the Z9. However, the glass finish is gone, replaced with plastic instead finished to achieve the same visual effect. It doesn't look bad but the cover is a little too thin and rigid, and looks prone to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the glass effect hasn't helped the Z9 mini solve the fingerprint issues of the original. After just a few hours of use, the back of the handset is a greasy mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the camera still sits in the top left corner with the single LED flash beside it. There is a prominent logo in the center of the back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is equipped with a pretty standard LCD panel. It is only slightly smaller than the Z9's at 5.0-inches, down from 5.2. Except for the absent edge-to-edge effect, the two screens are probably identical and the min's screen is reasonably sharp, with nice deep blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping the resolution of the original Nubia Z9, the mini's screen has more pixels per inch. At 441ppi, the Nubia Z9 mini is a little sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual numbers are pretty close. The Nubia Z9 mini's screen is a little dimmer with a maximum brightness of 394 nits, compared to 440 on the Z9, but neither offers exceptional contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast ratio is even closer at 895. The mini's sunlight visibility is only average. It is actually a little uncomfortable to read the Z9 mini's camera viewfinder on a bright sunny day, as the camera interface is all dark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Nubia Z9 mini battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is powered by a 2900mAh battery, just like its premium sibling. This is plenty of juice for the midrange hardware, so we can forgive the not too slim profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hoped for the Z9 mini to beat its premium sibling but the reality was different. The Z9 mini scored an overall rating of 65 hours, which is 5 hours less than the Z9. Somehow, the Snapdragon 615 and slightly smaller screen weren't exactly more economical compared to the Snapdragon 810 and 5.2-icnhes of display diagonal on the Z9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z9 mini was almost unaffected by dual-SIM usage with about 3 hours less in the overall endurance rating. In comparison, the Z9 took an 11-hour hit from having two radios on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the rest of the scores, they are pretty decent for a midranger. The Z9 mini offers only about two hours of talk time less than its flagship counterpart and practically the same time in video playback. Web browsing is only around eight hours on the mini, which could be due to the QQ browser and lack of optimization, but also the slower chipset might potentially be working overtime on some pages that the Snapdragon 810 would typically breeze through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Z9 and the Z9 mini allow a good deal of user control over apps and power consumption. This includes detailed monitoring of battery performance, as well as limiting background services and control of power-hungry apps. The OS is even nice enough to notify you automatically if any power-hogging is detected on the system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no support for Quick Charging or wireless charging on either model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is a dual SIM device, dual standby device with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and 3G with HSPA. 3G supports a total of six bands, whereas 4G has seven.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can reach speeds of up to 42.2Mbps of download and 5.76Mbps of upload on HSPDA, as well as 150Mbps of downloads over Cat.4 LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot mode are also available. Bluetooth 4.0 is also on board with A2DP. The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The satellite navigation chip inside the phone is compatible with GPS/GLONASS. There's an FM radio too. NFC is missing on the Z9 mini, as opposed to the original Z9.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface with no traces on Material design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the Nubia Z9, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini runs an Android 5.0.2-based software that has been heavily retouched with the Nubia UI 3.0.8. If you have experience with phones aimed at the Chinese market you already have an idea what to expect - a colorful, app drawer-free experience. There are also some bad translations and odd, but many times in a good way, options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, the elephant in the room. Our test unit came from HonorBuy and is intended for the Chinese market. Consequently Google is nowhere to be found on the handset as it is blocked on the vast Asian market. That means no Google Play Services, no Play Store, not even Gmail. Well, to be frank the latter can actually be added to the default email app, but other than that, using the Z9 mini you have to side-load most of the Android apps you might be accustomed to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, ZTE has included the Chinese alternatives for most mainstream apps in the ROM, but those are of little use outside the country. With root there are ways to enable Play Services, but this might be more than casual users can accomplish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, ZTE's latest OS is in fact based on Android Lollipop and even more impressively, on a fairly recent 5.0.2 build. Nubia UI 3.0.8 is based on Google's latest platform and yet it has little to no visual resemblance to vanilla Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has adopted the new core for the sake of performance, stability and API, but it is still heavily customized and on the surface the OS has retained its signature look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What ZTE has done, in a nutshell, is move to Android Lollipop, without Google's new material design. The user interface has remained flat with almost no traces of Google's latest aesthetics. Fans will also be happy to know that the OS is still packed with various extras and additional functions, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard - you get a dialer and camera shortcuts and can access the notification area. The dialer can actually be swapped for another app, but selection is limited. There is no squeeze to unlock, like in the Nubia Z9, but we don't really miss it, seeing how we couldn't get it to work properly on the Z9 anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like many other custom Android builds from China, Nubia UI doesn't have an app drawer. Everything is laid out on home panels instead. The homescreen deviates from Android standards. It has a special pane on the left, which is dedicated entirely to neoShare (a feature of the Weibo social network) and shortcuts to the various camera modes. The other homescreen panes hold widgets and shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the launcher style popular in China, no app drawer, instead drop everything into the homescreen (think iOS, but with widgets here and there). Folders help organize the madness if you have too many apps and you can dock the 4 most used apps at the bottom row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like the look, you can try out different themes. They change the wallpaper and icons, sounds too. Of course, you can also edit those one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has also developed an online portfolio of themes, wallpapers and ringtones. This is actually pretty common practice for Asian devices, as customization is a major selling point of smartphones. If none of the provided themes appeals to you, you can also edit every aspect or even create a new one from scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area combines notifications and quick toggles, plus a brightness slider. Only the top three quick toggles are visible at first, the rest are revealed with a second swipe. You can rearrange them so you can make the toggles you use most visible by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has implemented a pretty powerful Notification Center that gives you granular control over what apps get access to fire notifications. You can even define the types of notifications each application can generate - pretty thorough indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher is launched by long pressing the Home key and shows cards with all running apps, their shortcut and name below them. There's also an X that will "Accelerate" your phone by closing running apps. The phone even calculates how much RAM the process with free. Our advice - don't do it. The mantra "free RAM is wasted RAM" applies here. There is also a whitelist for services that you want to be skipped during the clean. It is definitely convenient and the important things usually get detected and put here automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the quick toggles you get to enable SplitScreen mode. If you guessed "run two apps at the same time" you get a cookie - the display is split in two (you can move the division line) and you can run one of several apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the best multi-app implementation we've seen, in fact it has some rather irritating issues. For one, you can view the homescreen twice, dock and all, which just looks weird. Also, not all apps resize to fit their allotted portion of the screen, most remain a downscaled 16:9 version of themselves, which is often too tiny to use properly. The good news is that even third-party apps seem to work in this mode and some of them are smarter about resizing than the Nubia's native apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can drag the division line all the way to the bottom, which will minimize that app to a small floating icon that can be used to reopen the app in its split-screen state.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Easy mode is available that shows huge, easy to hit shortcuts, four on a screen plus two docked icons (phone and SMS). The selection of apps is limited to the bare essentials in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ability to swap your back and menu buttons is definitely a nice little touch and can ease your transition to the Nubia from most other Android devices. For the moment these are the only two options available for customizing the capacitive navigation buttons, but the interface suggests that perhaps more will be added later. Further customization would be cool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accessibility and gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini lacks the edge to edge display of its bigger sibling it also lacks all the interesting gestures associated with it. Still, the phone is packed with interesting touch and motion controls, as well as a few accessibility features to ease the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are arranged into a total of five groups. First, there is double tapping the screen to unlock. It is a really handy feature that is finding its way on an increasing number of devices. There is also palm screen locking. You simply cover the screen with your hand and it locks. This works pretty well, but does tend to accidentally lock your device from time to time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has also added a few extra twists to taking screenshots. If you hold the power key and volume up, instead of down as you would for a normal screenshot, you get a free selection interface in which only a fraction of the display can be selected and captured. Also, swiping up on the screen with three fingers is a quick way to capture a screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you long for the nifty app switching of the Z9, the mini has an alternative for you. Simply swipe left or right with three fingers. It is actually quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of other available gestures - you can mute the device by simply flipping it around and also clear all your notifications with a little shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as accessibility goes, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is fairly well equipped with fine tuning such as color correction and inversion, font scaling and even captions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A word of warning - the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini software in its current state was really not meant for the western market. Most of the software has an English translation but oftentimes it's of Google Translate quality. It ranges from odd phrasing to downright incomprehensible. And that's if you're lucky enough to get a translation - the app store, for example, doesn't have a Latin letter in sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not the end of it. A lot of the apps that are on the phone are China-specific. At best they are not familiar to a western audience, at worst they just plain don't work, like the map app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has officially announced that it will be bringing the Nubia Z9 to the US and hopefully the Z9 mini as well. This means that a more English-friendly version is on its way (should land in Q3). We don't yet know if it will feature the Google Play package or not, but if it does (as it should) it will address many of our complaints.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini might take after its bigger sibling in terms of looks, but, as it's price tag would suggest, it is a undoubtedly mid-range offer. It is powered by what is currently Qualcomm's go to mid-range SoC - the Snapdragon 615. We have seen devices perform rather well with this chip, but it can also do quite poorly in our benchmarks when not properly implemented and utilized. The custom OS can have a major impact in this respect as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is equipped with a 5.0-inch Full HD screen, which is great for visuals, but does put some extra strain on the Adreno 405 GPU. RAM is set at 2GB which is plenty for most every task and the dual-band ac Wi-Fi chip should provide a stable stage for browser performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for contenders, it really wasn't difficult finding Snapdragon 615-powered handsets to pit the ZTE up against. Samsung, for instance, has based a lot of new devices on the very same platform, like the Galaxy J7 and the metal A7 and A8 models. All three are priced slightly higher than the Nubia Z9 mini, but still within mid-range limits. HTC also has a couple of units with the Snapdragon 615 inside - the Desire 820 and 826.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And on the local market, there is Oppo, with the R5 and R7 models - both also slightly costlier than the Nubia, but still based on mostly the same hardware platform. The vivo X5 Max is also in pretty much the same boat and so is the Archos 50 Diamond. ZTE itself has another Snapdragon 615 phone, which we have previously reviewed - the Blade S6, so we are throwing it in the mix as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also included a few other devices from the same price bracket as the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini. A quick search reveals that for about ?230 to ?300 you can currently pick up a Samsung Galaxy S5 mini or a Galaxy S4. Also the more-recent Galaxy A5. Other viable candidates include the Sony Xperia M4 aqua, the LG G2, most any Motorola Moto G, the Asus Zenfone 2 and a few other interesting offers. The following benchmark results show how well the Nubia Z9 mini stacks up against each one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough. Having eight cores is a definite plus and the pretty standard Snapdragon 615 clock speed of 1.0 GHz and 1.5 GHz for the two clusters has proven itself capable under loads and otherwise easy on the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini at the very middle of the chart. We can therefore conclude that the phone makes pretty good use of its Qualcomm chipset, but could potentially do better. Below the Z9 mini we find the vivo X5Max, which runs on the same chip, although the difference is negligible. However, we can clearly see the Blade S6, another recent ZTE handset way down the list with over 2000 points less, so the manufacturer definitely shows progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is some room for improvement. We see that the Xiaomi Mi 4i and Sony Xperia M4 Aqua both scored marginally better, so did the Archos 50 Diamond, the HTC Desire 820 and the two Oppo phones, not to mention the Samsung Galaxy A7, also running on a Snapdragon 615 chip. So, there is still a lot of power to be squeezed out of the silicon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini did a lot better for itself, which speaks well the performance of the rest of the device's internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, it managed to outshine all of its Snapdragon 615-powered competitors and only fall short of a pair of octa-core Mediatek devices and the Asus Zenfone 2 with its Intel chip. That is a remarkable achievement, but it is also an isolated occurrence among all of the test, so take the Antutu score with a grain of salt.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark OS II, which is a another all-round benchmark. The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini appeared to be breezing through this benchmark as well. The overall score paint much the same picture as Antutu, with the ZTE leaving its equally-specked competitors in the dust. Thankfully, however, we came prepared and put the phone through our anti-cheat version of the same benchmark. We also made sure to cool the unit properly between tests, to eliminate any doubt of thermal throttling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can observe the regular scores:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can clearly see that the Z9 mini falls short in the multi-core department, but that seems to be completely offset by the rest of the tests and the single-core score. However, the anti-cheat test reveals a boost in the scores, just enough to give the ZTE an edge. Now, we could be wrong, but these are the numbers we got. Judge for yourself:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Graphics performance for the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is as expected for the Adreno 405 GPU inside. Scores are pretty consistent with the equally specked competition. It is also important to note that the Z9 mini is equipped with a Full HD display, which takes its toll in onscreen tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 4i does seem to outshine a lot of the competition in the GFX 3.0 tests, both on screen and off screen, but the difference in frame rate is hardly noticeable in real life. As for the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua, HTC Desire 820, ZTE Blade S6 and Acer Liquid Jade S, they all have the "advantage" of a 720p screen resolution, which results in the impressive frame rates onscreen.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on the Browser performance the ZTE Blade Z9 mini has some glaring issues. This is where the odd OEM software really falls short. The enclosed scores were achieved with the phone's default browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is clear that it can't come even remotely close to the performance of a powerful and highly-optimized browser, such as Chrome. Furthermore, the fact that the OS is missing the Google Play store and most other services related to it, makes switching to another browser quite troublesome. We did actually manage to side-load the Chrome apk, but, as expected, the Google account login didn't work.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nubia Z9 mini benchmark performance is a mixed bag and not surprisingly. The phone is equipped with perfectly decent mid-range hardware, but riles on a highly custom implementation of Android. As with most devices geared for an Asian market - the GUI is refreshing and houses a lot of nice little feature and functionalities, but comes at the price of bad optimization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE has already stated its intention to bring the Nubia Z9 to the US, which in tern means that the OS should be optimized for international use. Hopefully, that means that the Z9 mini will get the same software transformation. However, the mini version might never venture outside China, in which, we urge any prospective buyers to consider the current state of the OS and weather it will suit their needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook with Yellow Pages built in<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is fairly standard, a part of the same multi-tabbed app as the dialer. You can assign personal ringtones for each contact and scan a business card to quickly add a new contact. Since there are no Google Play services don't count on getting your phonebook synced with the initial setup. Thankfully there are third party solutions for that, but you do have to side-load them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab of this app is titled "Yellow Page." It looks like local listings, complete with search, but it was in Chinese only and it didn't seem to work in our area so we couldn't really try it out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer shows your recent calls with the keypad on top (which can be hidden to make more room for the call log). Smart dialing is enabled - that is you can quickly search your contacts by typing - but the phone also pulls numbers for various shops and businesses from the Internet. The Info button next to each number shows more about that business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 is a dual-SIM, dual-standby phone. Each SIM gets its own ringtone and call button so it's easy to tell which number is getting called and calling from the right number. Call recording is available from the settings menu and can be set to begin automatically with each call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also switch which card is used for data from the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini scored below average on our loudspeaker test. It is on the quiet side and we wouldn't really count on it in a noisy environment. When DTS is turned on, along with volume enhancement, the device does reach an average score, quite close to what the bigger Z9 managed to accomplish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the dialer, the messaging app lets you easily send a message from either SIM card. Once you open a message thread you also get a clear indication of which SIM card received a given text too. The app itself looks like it belongs on iOS, it has a fairly clean UI but it's functional. A tab shows only starred messages and you can use search to find others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incoming messages (including MMS, naturally) are showed in popups and you can enable delivery reports. Creating a new message simply pops up an input field at the bottom and doesn't really switch to a new interface, which is kind of confusing at first, but is easy to get used to. There is a wide array of multimedia content that can be attached to a message, automatically converting it to MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email there isn't the usual Gmail app, instead you get a custom solution that supports Gmail but also a number of providers popular in China (163, qq, sina, etc.) along with Hotmail and Yahoo. Multiple accounts are supported and you can view the messages in a combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is attractive (again with iOS aesthetics) but it lacks some goodies of Gmail - push notifications (i.e. instant delivery of emails) and swiping between messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 uses the standard Android Keyboard, but also comes with Sogou, which handles Pinyin and handwriting input for eastern languages. The Android keyboard is quite good at that itself and has customizable appearance and button arrangements, plus swipe input. Sogou on the other hand has more knobs and switches than the Starship Enterprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options menu houses screen upon screens of toggles which often make little sense due to bad translation. There is even an option to use an old-style num-pad layout. Remember those? The convenience of having to press each button a set number of times to type a letter? Anyone? Well, it is in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dictation is not available though. Additional goodies like split-keyboard mode or changing the size of the keyboard are not present either. The one-handed mode scales the whole screen, including the keyboard, there's no dedicated small keyboard (not that you'd need one at 5.0").</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery sorts photos and videos by date or by folder. It also features Neoshare integration so you can browse photos others have posted online as well as post yourself. If you sign up for a Nubia account (you'll need a valid phone number to receive an SMS confirmation) you'll get 5 gigs of free storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the more privacy conscious, you can protect images with a pattern. A security question will be set up in case you forget the pattern. The gallery has some fun editing options that allow you to create collages from multiple images or animated GIFs instead. Filters and effects are abundant as well. Any teenager would be spoiled for choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's integration with Neoshare (a Weibo service) and your Nubia account, but no western cloud services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player integrates offline and online playback. Confusingly, the Local tab shows a number of floating links that lead to online features, instead you have to hit the Songs link. After that things are standard - music sorted into tabs with a Shuffle all button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Download Manager, you can download songs for offline listening, or just go into the Online tab and browse available artists and playlists. The online services are provided by Xiaomi Music and do not work outside of China.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you pick and offline or online track, you get Dolby Digital Plus sound enhancement. There are several presets, but you can create two custom ones. There's a volume leveler and surround virtualizer, plus a 5-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player will also automatically look for lyrics to display while playing the track, though it failed to find the words to some very popular tracks. This is likely a regional issue (i.e. we didn't test it in China) rather than a small lyrics library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the ZTE Nubia Z9 supports both FLAC and ALAC - lossless digital formats, the second one is used by Apple (so no re-encoding needed if you have an iTunes library).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini is equipped with a radio receiver and even has RDS. The radio app itself is pleasant to use and has a clean interface. Also quire reminiscent of Apple software.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player is fairly simple in terms of UI but very capable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It lacks subtitle support. You can view the video in a small floating window, a feature inspired by TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have access to the same Dolby Digital Plus sound settings and here you can make use of the Dialog enhancer (to reduce the "loud explosions, quiet speaking" thing that modern movies do). Strangely, you can't change the audio settings while watching a video, they are accessible only from the main screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, our unit had some issues with the audio quality testing procedure and no coherent data was gathered. Perhaps it is an isolated issue with our test device. For what it's worth, the Z9 mini did sound exceptionally loud when outputting to headphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It there is one department that ZTE hasn't cut corners with the Nubia Z9 mini, it would definitely have to be the camera. The phone is equipped with a 16MP main shooter with a maximum resolution of 5312 x 2988 pixels. As is evident, this is actually a 16:9 sensor, which is definitely a rarity even in mid-rangers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is pretty close to what you get in the Z9 and only seems to lack optical image stabilization. Sadly, unlike the Snapdragon 810, the Snapdragon 615 inside the Z9 doesn't have the power to record 4K video, which is a shame considering the required resolution is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the camera is very capable and shares the same powerful and feature rich app with its bigger sibling. Even the front-facing camera on the Z9 mini is impressive. It has an 8MP sensor and can do 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very clean and simple. On the left side, you get quick toggles for the flash and timer, a button to switch between the two cameras and a settings shortcut. On the right there is a shutter button with video mode beside it, a quick preview windows and a PRO toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings are quite a few, but surprisingly easy to navigate. Sone of the options are pretty advanced. You get a gradient, a few grids, depth of field detection and even shutter priority mode. There is also speed camera, which when enabled, allows quick shots from a locked screen by double-tapping the volume button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z9 mini camera does have a dedicated video interface, although if you shoot photos in 16MP, there won't be any difference in the field of view. Unlike most smartphone 4:3 camera sensors, where a 16:9 video has to be cropped inside the 4:3 area, the Z9 mini has the advantage of using the full size of its sensor for video. This means that you can actually capture a lot more in frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video mode has its own separate set of settings, which might not be as many, but are quite useful. Besides video quality the Z9 mini has the option to lock the focus while recording. This is really convenient in a lot of circumstances, when you don't want nasty focus-hunting mid-clip. There is also a toggle for disabling zooming when recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if these options aren't enough to satisfy your photographic needs, there is also a dedicated pro mode. It has exposure control, shutter, white balance, iso and manual focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, even with the PRO mode, the camera interface still seems orderly and clean. A lot of that might be due to the fact that ZTE has removed all its special camera modes and filters and placed them in a dedicated screen on the launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of these advanced modes are really fun to use, especially in low-light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini camera captures really nice photos, with plenty of resolved detail, accurate colors and edge to edge sharpness. The 16MP camera isn't only impressive on paper, it delivers quality shots and the unit definitely strikes above its price league in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode works great too bringing up even more detail in the shadows, without sacrificing the image quality. The effect, however, is far from subtle and does tend to produce oversaturated whites in some shots. But if you shoot a few times, at least one is bound to come out nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, every time you shoot with HDR enabled, the Z9 mini actually saves two versions of the shot - one with the effect and one without. So even if the result is not satisfactory, the shot isn't necessarily lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up close, the Z9 mini does a pretty good job of focusing from up close as well. Here are a couple of macro photos to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini takes high-res panorama images, with great stitching, excellent contrast and very good detail levels. Artefacts rarely occur - ZTE has really been outdoing itself with the panorama software lately. Here are samples taken in both orientations of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP front-facing shooter does a swell job as well. Here is a quick selfie sample for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia has plenty of smartphones to contend with in our Photo compare tool, which lets you see just how it fares against other 16MP shooters. We've placed it up against its bigger sibling - the Nubia Z9, to see if there is any noticeable difference in quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   ZTE Nubia Z9 mini in our photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the budget-friendly device offers a splendid camera experience, especially for its price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini shoots 1080p video at exactly 30 fps. As we already mentioned, the 16MP are well over what is necessary for 4K recording, but the Snapdragon 615 chipset simply can't handle it. That is a shame, but even at FullHD the Z9 mini performs almost like a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolve detail is great and the solid fps results in smooth motions. There is also stereo sound at 96Kbps. Another nifty little trick that the Z9 mini can do is lock its focus while recording. This is ideal for shooting from a fixed vantage point and eliminated all possibility of nasty focus hunting in our test videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here a sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a 1080p@30fps untouched video (10s ~ 13MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia Z9 mini does also come with a HFR video mode, which seems to work OK, but is sadly limited to a max resolution of 720x480 pixels. At that point the detail is simply not there, rendering the mode all but unusable. We suspect this is yet another Snapdragon 615 limitation and perhaps it would have been best to just remove it from the camera app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini really managed to shine in the camera department, video included. The phone managed to capture sharp and smooth videos with impressive resolve detail and a constant video and audio bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   ZTE Nubia Z9 mini in our video compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-light performance is also quite impressive and overall, the Z9 mini can easily be suggested as an affordable sharpshooter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser: feature overload<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia comes with the QQ Browser. You may not have heard of it, but it has tens of millions of users. It's one of the most feature-loaded browsers, having a built-in ad blocker and page compression out of the box, with plug-ins to add even more stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see what you get. One feature we like is swiping left/right to go back/forward. That means there's no gesture to switch between tabs though (tabs are supported, obviously, you just have to go through the button). Another interesting option is to scroll web pages with the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the browser is somewhat Safari-like and there is indeed an option to make it tell servers it's an Apple browser. That will be used rarely, only on sites that show different pages for iOS devices. The browser supports skins so you can customize its look too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's compression, which is enabled by default. Tencent servers will compress pages before sending them to your phone (you can chose the image quality: Low, Medium, High), which speeds things along on slow connections. You can block images altogether too. Another trick for faster browsing is to preload the page the browser thinks you'll open, but that may cost you if you are on a data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an ad blocker though it didn't have a 100% hit rate. Another privacy feature is Stealth mode, which is a type of Private browsing. When you first launch the browser it informs you that your privacy is a high priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get to plug-ins. No, not Flash. One plug-in is enabled by default called "Compare Prices," we're not sure which sites it works on though (not Amazon.com, AliExpress.com or dx.com). The other two suggested widgets are "Game Zone" and "Thunder Widget" (not sure what this one is for). Those two you have to install manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we saw already, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini doesn't rely much on the Google-developed Android package. The phone does come with a full suite of apps and you can get more from the store - not the Play Store though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned before, ZTE is working on a US version of the software, which will most likely come with the Google Play suite. The version of the software we tested is intended for China and will work great there. Not so elsewhere. Play apps will function much better in the west.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app store on the Z9 mini is one of the apps that was not translated, not even a bit. Obviously, it's not as well stocked as Play, but it doesn't work as smoothly either - even updating apps shows the install dialog you may have seen while sideloading apps. This means updating 10 apps requires a lot of hitting "Install" then "Done."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GameBox is a place to download games and compare scores with your friends, similar to Google's Play Games. The app also supports QQ and WeChat accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're not getting Google Maps either, instead there's Amap. The app doesn't work - it completely lacks mapping info for most of the world, you can't even see London or New York, let alone their streets. There's a full map of China, though the app loads map tiles slower than we're used to. There's the Baidu app, which is a bit better but still far from functional anywhere outside of China. Both are in Chinese.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at something easier - the Calendar. That does work and it's a capable (if heavily iOS-inspired) app. No syncing with your Google calendar, not even if you add your account. It can sync with other online calendars and you get the usual views, including agenda.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TimeManager, aka the Clock app, supports multiple alarms each with their own ringtone and repeat pattern. There's also a world clock, stopwatch and timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice addition that most other custom skins lack is the Backup app. You can create local backups or store them in the cloud (only the Nubia cloud is supported). The app will store personal data (contacts, messages, etc.), system data, apps and even media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Software update app that can either download a ROM automatically or use one you've downloaded manually. There are even handy shortcuts to boot into Fastboot mode or into the recovery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Screen projection app handles DLNA duties if you don't want to bother with MHL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth companion app requires an additional dongle, which will let you take calls, read messages and listen to music wirelessly. You'll also get a reminder if you walk out of range of your phone. The Bluetooth Finder app works similarly, but with a Nubia Bluetooth tag that prevents you from leaving things behind or misplacing your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the Z9 mini is missing both the IR blaster and the NFC hardware that that the Z9 has and is thus missing out on some cool applications, like the Remote control app and the Smart tag one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A file manager lets you explore the internal memory and it has built in support for ZIP and APK files. You can connect USB OTG storage and browse that too, or sync files with your Nubia cloud account (no other cloud services are supported). However, its menu structure is a little confusing and you have to switch tabs to actually brose ant OTG device or view the file structure itself. Still, it is pretty feature-rich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are additional tools available out of the box - from the NotePad, through the SoundRecorder to the simple calculator and flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia UI experience is definitely a mixed bag. On the one hand it is highly-custom and a lot of native Android features are missing. The Asia-specific app package is a whole other problem, but one of major concern for usability on international markets. No the other hand, however, like so many OEM Android builds, Nubia UI offers a refreshing take on Google's OS with lots of often neat features burned right in. One prime example is the extensive Powersaver app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is an amazingly in-depth hub for managing most every aspect of your phone's battery. It monitors charging, discharging an even stores historical data, organized by process, non the less. It can also toggle power modes and if that isn't enough to manage your battery consumption - there are per app controls. With a few clicks you can determine which applications get network access or the ability to spawn background services. The attention to detail in the application and its depth are amazing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the ZTE Nubia Z9 mini was deprived of the defining feature of its bigger sibling. No edge-to-edge screen, so why bother?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bezel-less screen is probably the Nubia line's best shot at getting out of obscurity in markets long cornered by the prominent names in this industry. What would the odds be if you take that special feature away? A Chinese brand selling mostly at home and doing good business in India against the likes of Sony, Samsung and LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you think about it though, all the praise and positive publicity the bezel-free Nubia Z9 is getting will be worth nothing if the price tag scares you away. We're not saying it's not fair for what the phone offers but's it's serious cash for a phone from a second-tier maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comes the mini at half price. Mind you, the mini moniker is rather misleading here- with a 5" Full HD screen, Lollipop, a capable camera, LTE and a solid chipset by a respectable vendor. A good-looking handset too, with a distinct face. The plastic mini looks almost as impressive as its bigger sibling, which got treated to a glass unibody. However, the mini's removable cover helps customizability and lets you pop in a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia UI is visually appealing and has some extra functionality baked right in. The Z9 mini packs an impressive camera for the price range too. The 16MP Sony-made primary unit produces beautiful photos and the pro mode and extra filters help enhance the imaging experience. The 8MP selfie cam rounds off a solid package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z9 mini is built on the Snapdragon 615 SoC, which powers devices by the likes of Samsung, HTC, Sony, Motorola and Oppo. Integrating Cat. 4 LTE and dual-SIM support the Qualcomm chipset has become the popular midrange choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If ZTE is going to compete with the above in the Western hemisphere, the decision seems justified. Samsung's Galaxy A5 and A7 are a good example of what the Nubia Z9 mini will be dealing with. Part of Samsung's new metal-clad lineup, the pair looks sharp with both phones notably slimmer than the Z9 mini. Each offers a Super AMOLED screen and you get to choose the level of equipment that fits your budget. The cheaper A5 is powered by Snapdragon 410 and has a 5" 720p screen. The A7 offers FullHD resolution on a 5.5" diagonal and a Snapdragon 615 SoC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy A5 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy A7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is roughly the same size and level of equipment - it fails to match ZTE's FullHD screen but tries to make up for it with water resistance. There is also a dual-SIM version, so Sony has that covered as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia M4 Aqua</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Domestic rivals Huawei have beaten ZTE to a European release of their Honor 7. It seems the right way for the Nubia Z9 mini to respond to the headstart and superior equipment is a competitive price. The super-slim Oppo R5 is another challenger from China to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei Honor 7 &#x2022; Oppo R5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, ZTE is perhaps learning from its compatriots - Nubia is being positioned as a premium brand with no reference to ZTE on the device itself. Quite like the Honors by Huawei used to be when the company was first arriving in these parts of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, while Huawei and Oppo are relatively easy to compete with on price, ZTE may struggle to profitably match the discounts offered by Xiaomi and Meizu. The Meizu m1 note is slightly bigger than the Z9 mini with a 5.5-inch display and is powered by a Mediatek chipset, but we found it to be near unbeatable value for money in our review. The Xiaomi Mi 4i is looking no less threatening with Lollipop and Snapdragon 615 for a fraction of the Nubia Z9 mini's price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Xiaomi Mi 4i &#x2022; Meizu m1 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So ZTE have a tough riddle to solve. Phones by the major brands are more expensive but they are often being subsidized and ZTE should be trying to secure carrier deals to neutralize that advantage. All the while working hard on Europe and US-friendly software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the meantime, the mini will no doubt benefit from the bezel-less screen hype around the original Nubia Z9. No infinity screen here obviously but therefore 50% off the full price. If it sounds like a fair deal, the mini won't disappoint. It won't surprise you either.</paragraph>
