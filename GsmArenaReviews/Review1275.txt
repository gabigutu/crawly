			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the original Motorola RAZR came out in 2004 it turned the mobile world upside down with its slim profile and impressive design. Motorola sold more than 50 million units of the device, which makes it the all time best-selling clamshell. However, Motorola didn't quite manage to continue riding the enormous wave of success which the RAZR set and inevitably lost momentum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now though, the RAZR name is back. This time around the Motorola RAZR doesn't come in the clamshell form factor, but it sure has all the charisma and power to become as huge a success as its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just look at that specs sheet:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can plainly see the Motorola RAZR isn't anything short of an Android smartphone powerhouse. There's just so much to like about it and we can't really see any deal-breakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the glorious 4.3-inch qHD Super AMOLED Advanced display, going through its super slim waistline and ending with the extraordinary materials used for its body - the RAZR is definitely a head-turner. And it has the performance to match those looks, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, with that out of the way, let's go straight to the Motorola RAZR hardware inspection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Holding the Motorola RAZR for the first time you immediately notice how thin and light it is. Motorola has put the new RAZR on an extreme diet and the results are fascinating. The RAZR boasts a waistline of just 7.1mm which, in fact makes it one of the slimmest smartphones in the world. Of course, there's a bit of a bulge around the camera lens, but this won't be where you would normally be holding the phone so we are willing to let this one slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR build quality is quite impressive, too. Motorola R&amp;D obviously wasn't kept on a short leash with this one and nor were they afraid to use materials that might bring the production price of the smartphone up. That's why you'll find quite a lot of nice surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, the back of the Motorola RAZR is made of Kevlar, which is five times stronger than steel. The backbone of the phone is made out of stainless steel for extra rigidity. But most impressive of all is the special material Motorola have dressed the internals of the RAZR with to avoid it being killed by splashes of water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR doesn't disappoint in the display department as well. With its 4.3-inch qHD Super AMOLED Advanced display, the device stacks up pretty well against the Samsung Galaxy S II, not to mention how it crushes both the HTC Desire Z and HTC 7 Mozart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has launched a bunch of new accessories for the RAZR as well, just like they did for the Atrix. One of them is the Multimedia dock, which has multiple USB ports and an HDMI out port to connect with your TV Set. It is wired to the phone itself, but wireless control of the whole thing is possible through Motorola's Smart Controller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Controller, which resembles a remote control, uses Bluetooth and controls your phone via a trackpad and the four standard Android buttons. The trackpad supports multitouch and when you operate it a typical black mouse cursor appears on the screen to guide you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature of the remote is its ability to be used as a wireless phone receiver. Flip it and you can take a call via the integrated speaker and microphone. The Smart Controller has an HID Bluetooth profile, which means that if properly configured, you can use it with virtually any Bluetooth device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two new lapdocks were also introduced. The Lapdock 100 and 500 will transform the RAZR into a full-fledged notebook utilizing its hardware to the max. Looks like Moto want to continue the trend they set with the ATRIX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we'd be taking a short tour around the Motorola RAZR UI. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a quick hands-on video to demonstrate the Motorola RAZR user interface. Motorola have added a few custom touches to the Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and they seem to be working well from what we can tell so far - adding extra functionality (like lock screen camera launch) without getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>About 30 seconds into the video one of the coolest home-baked additions to the Motorola RAZR interface appears. Functionality similar to that of the Smart actions has been available through various third-party apps for some time now but Motorola is the first to actually bake it in the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is basically a clever way to manage your phone based on its location, battery status, the time of the day and whatnot. For example you can make your phone go to vibrate automatically whenever you are at home and it's past 11 PM. Or activate its Wi-Fi whenever you enter your office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many presets available, but creating actions of your own isn't hard at all. Multiple triggers can be added and all must be in effect for smart action to execute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool feature will be brought to other devices as well in the near future, but Motorola provided no exact time frame for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other cool new feature of the Motorola RAZR is the MotoCast media server that you can run from your desktop PC or Mac. You can then stream multimedia content to your phone through both 3G and Wi-Fi networks and if you want you can even download some of it to the phone for offline usage. It's a great way to keep all your videos, images and music tracks available without wasting too much storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MotoCast even lets you access the files on your computer and allows you to get documents over-the-air, as long as you have any type of a working data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all we are really pleased with the Motorola RAZR performance. The general interface browsing is smooth as silk and we even managed to get a 720p Flash video to play on this one (though 1080p was beyond its capabilities). Here comes the video proof of that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We left the Motorola RAZR feeling quite positive about its market prospects. The slim and powerful smartphone is exactly what the company needs to bring back the glory of the old days and while the RAZR alone will hardly make it the world's number 1 phone maker, it's certainly a huge step forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or so it appears, as we'd need to spend some more time with it before we can give a final verdict. Still, the potential is all there and it will be a real pity if the Motorola RAZR doesn't live up to it. The innovative build materials, the really impressive screen and the super-slim body, without sacrificing anything in terms of performance is too great a package to be wasted. Here's hoping Motorola will get the rest of it right, too.</paragraph>
