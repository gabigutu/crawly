			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T Wireless is long overdue. The market is brimming of dual-core Android devices and the slide-out QWERTY packing Samsung Captivate Glide has only just arrived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, it?s been a relatively quiet year for the fans of the hardware QWERTY droids. The offerings are few, while the potential users are plenty ? good news for Samsung?s entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of specs, the Samsung Captivate Glide is rather closely related to the Galaxy R ? the two major differences between the two phones can be found in the screen department and, of course, the presence of hardware QWERTY in the case of the Captivate Glide. The smartphone sports an NVIDIA Tegra 2 CPU with two 1GHz cores and a gig of RAM. The display has been taken straight from last year?s Galaxy S ? not a bad a thing since the 4? Super AMOLED unit with WVGA resolution is still is one of the finest screens on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, we?ll begin by taking a look at the key features of the Samsung Captivate Glide, followed immediately by its main disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there is plenty the Samsung Captivate Glide has to offer. Its hardware QWERTY is one of the most comfortable examples we?ve encountered. The Tegra 2 CPU on the other hand, while not a typical fixture for Samsung?s Android lineup, is certainly respectable in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our initial disappointment came from the fact that the device lacks even the slightest reference to the Galaxy S II family, despite the fact that the Captivate Glide is properly equipped to be a part of it. On this instance, we believe that both Samsung and AT&amp;T have overlooked the marketing potential which such a branding would have offered (Samsung Galaxy S II in all its different incarnations is still selling quite briskly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to continue next with an unboxing of the Samsung Captivate Glide, followed by design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare bones retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the retail box of the Samsung Captivate Glide, you will find a charger, a USB cable, and a couple of booklets. There are no headphones or microSD card in the bundle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The omission of headphones, memory card, or both, as in this particular case, has been occurring a lot lately. We don?t believe that a device from the price category of the Captivate Glide should have these essential accessories omitted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to its Android lineup in the United States, Samsung is not particularly bold in terms of design. The Captivate Glide is no exception from the trend ? it is unmistakably a member of the aforementioned family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same rule applies for the device?s build quality. High quality plastic is the predominant material at play here, while the front has seen the Corning Gorilla Glass treatment. While we ourselves would have preferred a metal-clad body for the phone, we can?t help but appreciate the weight advantage of the plastic construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide measures are 124 x 64 x 13 mm, and its weight tips the scale at 147 grams. This is quite a commendable achievement ?the closest competitor of the Captivate Glide in terms of weight is 20 grams heavier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is available only in an all black color scheme ? hardly a surprise given its business aspirations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4? Super AMOLED Plus screen of the Samsung Captivate Glide is packing the usual WVGA resolution. Its compact (compared to the other Samsung made droids) size allows for a decent pixel density and, thus, nice and sharp content display. We are sure that we have also mentioned to you the superb contrast levels and viewing angles of this particular Samsung unit ? it is still better than most of the competition offerings despite its considerable age.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the usual suspects ? four touch sensitive buttons like in all the high-end Android offerings from Samsung. Above the screen are the ambient light and proximity sensors, the earpiece, as well as the front-facing camera unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung Captivate Glide, you will find the volume rocker. The power/lock key is on the right. We hope that, by now, you have gotten used to not seeing a dedicated camera button on your Samsung made Android device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide-out QWERTY opening mechanism is located on the right side of the device. The keyboard itself is one of the most comfortable examples we have encountered in quite some time. Its four rows of key are perfectly spaced out and nicely illuminated. The four main buttons for controlling the OS are at hand, as well as arrow buttons ? you can operate the device without even touching the screen if you want to. The buttons themselves feel pleasantly firm when pressed. With a metal bezel surrounding them, they are nice to look at as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Samsung Captivate Glide, you will find the 3.5mm audio jack, as well as the microUSB port slot, which is protected by a sliding cover. On the bottom of the device is where the mouthpiece resides. It is tucked into the tiny battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP shooter and its LED flash are located on the back of the device. The loudspeaker is keeping them company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the battery cover of the Samsung Captivate Glide. Both the SIM and microSD cards are hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1650mAh battery of the device is the same as the unit used in the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II. The Captivate Glide came out of our battery test with a score of 39 hours. This means that you will have to charge your device every 39 hours if you use it for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the full scoop on the battery test of the Samsung Captivate Glide here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Captivate Glide very easy to handle. The plastic on its back has a nice texture to it, therefore preventing accidental drops. The 4? screen is on the lower end of the size charts these days ? it allows you to easily operate the phone with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we found nothing to frown about as far as design and build quality of the Samsung Captivate Glide go. The company has stuck with the familiar formula which has worked pretty well for it in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to take a look at the software department of the device. Don?t be surprised if things look familiar here are well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and TouchWiz 4.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are absolutely no surprises in the software section of the Samsung Captivate Glide. The smartphone comes with the extremely familiar Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread, dressed in Samsung?s latest TouchWiz launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Captivate Glide in action for you. Check it out below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen can be removed by swiping in any direction. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen got plenty of tweaks too. You get rectangular design for the widgets and a lot of functionality. The process of adding widgets is visually enhanced too with attractive transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a QWERTY device, the Samsung Captivate Glide will see a lot of action in landscape mode as well. Here, the homescreen layout changes a bit ? the four docked icons move from its bottom to the left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the proprietary Samsung widgets allow you to edit them directly on the homescreen. We find this feature to be particularly neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is improved as well. You can now create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. With 1GB or RAM and with the Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications straight on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a proper dual-core device, the Samsung Captivate Glide offered silky smooth OS experience. We are now about to take a closer look into the NVIDIA Tegra 2 performance credentials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>CPU performance: NVIDIA Tegra 2 is up to snuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The NVIDIA made CPU in the Samsung Captivate Glide is a sharp departure from the usual silicon suspects in the dual-core Samsung devices. Still, we found its performance to be more than acceptable, when it benchmarked it. The results are below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are could have been better in the browser benchmark performance though. The Vellamo score of the Captivate Glide came out quite average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By now, we all know that the synthetic benchmark scores often have little reference to the actual user experience. The same goes for the Samsung Captivate Glide. The device was practically lag-free ? it handled everything we threw its way with ease.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook does it all as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the original Galaxy S. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too. If you don?t need that, you can still opt for the phonebook to augment your existing contacts info with stuff downloaded from the social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony, voice commands really work too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would naturally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fully covered as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of virtual text entry, the Samsung Captivate Glide offers you a whopping three options in addition to its hardware QWERTY. First, you have the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers very big and comfortable keys. In landscape mode, the keyboard takes up most of the display and the even bigger keys make it one of the most comfortable virtual mobile keyboards around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the above choice, you have the stock Android keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype. All in all, you have a keyboard for every mood and occasion. Plus you can download more off the Android Market ? there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser are a familiar sight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and s soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is simple yet powerful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (adjust them back or forth a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with WMV through AVI (DivX and XviD) and MP4 to MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Captivate Glide played Full HD files just fine. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera does a good job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Captivate Glide offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too; we?re only listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures from the device's camera cam out really good. There is plenty of detail to them; noise can be found only in the darker areas. See them below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video camera tops out at 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the camcorder of the Samsung Captivate Glide cannot capture full HD videos ? you will have to make do with 720p ones. We cannot think of a logical reason for this occurrence ? the device has plenty of horsepower to handle video recording in full HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos, captured by the Captivate Glide were of good quality. The camcorder however, tends to change focus while recording - a well known issue for all Samsung camera units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below is a 720p video, captured with Samsung Captivate Glide?s camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here goes an untouched 720p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity will overwhelm you with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G. There?s HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s technically not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Captivate Glide for AT&amp;T allow great user experience. The sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung offers you a couple of Hubs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone 7 ? Samsung, at least, seems to think so. They?ve added two Hubs to their QWERTY offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Hub lets you buy or rent movies or TV shows. Its interface is neat and intuitive, while its setup will take you no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an office editor for the overly productive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide comes with Quickoffice preinstalled. It?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a full-blown hardware QWERTY on board, one can get seriously productive with the office editor of the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a YouTube app although it?s really irrelevant here. It cannot match the resolution the in-browser flash player can give you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Don?t go anywhere without Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also find your way indoors with Google Maps too. The latest version of the software brings you indoor navigation of a number of shopping locations and airports across America (for the moment at least). We found the function to be quite neat, despite in Beta form.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics, the Captivate Glide can run every Android app designed for phones. The NVIDIA made CPU is especially capable when it comes to video games ? there are a few titles which are exclusively made for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS version is 2.3.5 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also books, movies, and music. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide is aiming for the interest of a special group of people ? the messaging and social network junkies, which abound here in the United States. We believe that, especially for those who are already fond of Android, the device will be a welcome upgrade. It also has plenty of appeal for potential OS converts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the hardware QWERTY of the device a lot ? it is a perfect addition to an already familiar package. Having it on board, along with the Exchange ActiveSync support and virtual private network access and device encryption capabilities, makes the Samsung Captivate Glide a serious business alternative ? something which until recently was almost exclusively reserved for the offerings of a certain Canadian company. In the case of the Captivate Glide however, you are bound to have a much better experience in terms of OS and sheer entertainment capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the smartphone?s hardware is more than adequate. The presence of an NVIDIA Tegra 2 CPU made us raise our brows at first and be a bit skeptical. It turned out that there is no reason for such feelings ? it performed up to our expectations. Plus, you get access to the graphics-rich Tegra-only games in the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We gotta admit, the lack of full HD recording is a bit of a letdown. The other fault is the lack of any Galaxy related branding. Like we mentioned earlier, Samsung and AT&amp;T have overlooked the brand potential here ? the Captivate Glide is more than capable of carrying the Galaxy moniker. Besides, its predecessor on AT&amp;T, the Samsung Captivate, was marketed as a Galaxy S phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide is priced at $199.99 with a two-year contract on AT&amp;T?s network. Currently there are not many Android alternatives on the market. It appears that the manufacturers had their focus elsewhere this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Droid 3 on Verizon Wireless is a capable alternative. It sports a more solid build and an extra row of keys on its QWERTY. Its screen is also of higher, qHD resolution. The Droid 3 will set you back the same amount of money as the Captivate Glide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Droid 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile MyTouch 4G Slide is another QWERTY option. The HTC made device is essentially a keyboard-equipped Sensation 4G, save for the screen resolution. It does however, offer a brilliant 8MP shooter with enough modes to put some point and shoot cameras to shame. You must keep in mind though, that the T-Mobile customized UI of the device might not be to everyone?s taste. The MyTouch 4G Slide currently sells for the highly acceptable $99.99 on a contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile MyTouch 4G Slide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above two are the only Android alternatives with dual-core CPUs on the U.S. market at the moment. If you are the strict business type, it is worth taking a look at the BlackBerry Bold 9900 and Torch 9810. Both RIM devices offer comfortable QWERTYs to go with their business credentials. You can find them on AT&amp;T for $199.99 and $49.99 respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Bold 9900 ? BlackBerry Torch 9810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Captivate Glide is a well-rounded device, despite coming a tad late to the market. It should be a welcome upgrade to the single-core Android QWERTY users, as well as an interesting alternative for the business crowd. We do believe that with a proper marketing budget, it will have its share of success. The lack of serious QWERTY-equipped competition will certainly help its cause.</paragraph>
