			<paragraph>It's been a while since mobile phones became an essential business tool and a huge number of devices are being specially designed for the purpose (not even mentioning the camera-free versions of some handsets). Nokia Eseries is almost a default name that comes to mind. Following a comprehensive review of Nokia E71, we are set to explore the other hot Eseries gadget. It's Nokia E66 with a priority appointment in our office. Refreshments served upon conclusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're obviously on a streak here, dealing with phones that are, above all, tools. All right, after a bit of blue collar comic relief with the Sonim XP1, we're back to the corporate floor with Eseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 lacks the full QWERTY keypad of its sibling- the E71 but still packs some serious business power. The great looks and the more than decent multimedia capabilities are also a welcome bonus. Those working in camera-restricted areas are probably the only ones to frown at the business slider but who knows - a camera-free version might be lurking out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screening the market for a worthy alternative of Nokia E66, we almost instantly stumble upon Samsung i550w. It has almost the same specs as the Nokia, comes with a larger screen and costs less. Now, all that doesn't make your choice any easier. Nokia E66 has much better build quality and looks so much hotter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, Samsung seem to have a sub warming up to run against Nokia E66. The Symbian-based Samsung L870 is no lesser looker with that brushed steel hull, though quite trimmed down on specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software goodies are also noteworthy: E66 has some extras that are normally only available to Feature pack 2 (and even some that are Eseries exclusive like the dual homescreen modes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry and their Pearl series are also trying to pressure Nokia E66 but at this stage they don't seem to have the ultimate challenger. It's either 3G or GPS, or some other important feature missing, to relegate RIM's devices to a lower league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, without the full QWERTY keypad of E71, Nokia E66 is exposed to quite some pressure within the Nokia's very own Nseries too. With the same OS and Feature Pack 2, the Nseries devices can cover almost all the business applications of E66 and be powerful business tools in their own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not keep our Nokia E66 waiting. Next on our agenda is design and ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxed to surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia E66 is much to our liking. For starters, the phone comes with Nokia's fastest and smallest charger. It's so tiny that you can comfortably to carry it around in a pocket. Not that you'll need it too often: the battery is rather good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2GB microSD card also comes with the E66, so you're pretty well covered for the most common scenarios (unless you are among the few that do demand more storage space on their mobile phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice leather case and a leather lanyard are in the box too, and so is a CD with PC synchronization software. The supplied handsfree, much like the E71, won't let you use the hands-free remote with another headset (no standard audio jack on it). Finally there is a whole load of paperwork including manuals, quick start guides and a few leaflets - nothing essential as usual.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E66 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 stands at 107.5 x 49.5 x 13.6mm and has a volume of 62.6cc, which make it really pocket-friendly. In all fairness, the weight of 121g isn't the most flattering but the great finish and solid feel do take their toll. The Nokia E66 is the slimmest smartphone slider currently on the market and this might just be enough for quite a lot of potential buyers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What most people associate with business handsets is stillborn design, lots of keys and anything but nice to look at, let alone shove in everyone's face. The Nokia E65 did break that rule and we are now happy to see E66 follow suite. The metal accents up front and the back panel look awesome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece of Nokia E66 is placed at the top of the front panel, with an ambient light sensor and video-call camera on either side. Below are the 2.4" display and the main controls around the traditional D-pad. All are large enough and very solid to press, especially the two selection keys and the call and end keys. The rest of the controls include the so-called one-touch keys, the back and the solid D-pad with its large and comfortable confirming center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting detail is that the keys don't have any labels on them unless they're illuminated. This gives the phone really sleek, albeit somewhat strange looks when backlighting is off. The final element on the front panel is the mouthpiece, which is placed on the chin right where the slider rests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.5mm standard audio jack, the microUSB port and the infrared port are on the left side of Nokia E66. The USB port is covered by a small plastic cap for protection. The audio jack didn't receive the same treatment but our experience shows that those are better left as they are: a lid often gets in the way when trying to plug in a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger plug and the lanyard eyelet are at the bottom. There is nothing special to note here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lanyard eyelet and charger plug</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Nokia E66 we come upon the two volume keys, the voice command key and the dedicated shutter key. They all have sufficient size and tactility and we are more than pleased with them. The one thing we didn't like here is that the camera key doesn't automatically start the camera application, so you have to launch it elsewhere from the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find an unpleasant, though not unexpected, surprise. It's the same utterly tasteless cheapo red power knob much like the one on the Nokia E71. We would've only understood that styling in a self-destruct-do-not-ever-press button. Another disappointment about the power key is it's quite hard to reach when the slider is up. Be it for powering the phone on or off or for quick switching the active profile - you have to close the phone to press the key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The steel back panel of Nokia E66 is a true redemption though. The problem we experienced with E71 still stands but fingerprint smudges are the price to be paid we guess. Reraside we find the 3 megapixel auto-focus camera lens, with LED flash and self-portrait mirror. While we can say right away that the LED flash is no good, the rest of the camera performance will be discussed in more detail latter on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is also to be noticed on the back panel - right in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is removed by pressing the two release knobs on either side at the bottom. The all-metal part easily pops out, which is another point earned for the device. Under the cover we find the microSD card slot and the 1000 mAh Li-Ion BL-4U battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it is not nearly as impressive as the 1500 mAh monster mounted on the E71, the Nokia E66 battery pulled off a more than decent performance. Quoted at 7.5 hours of talk time and 264 hours of stand-by, it sticks out a little over two full days of heavy usage. Good enough, considering the power-hungry applications in there (GPS, Wi-Fi, 2.4" screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put Nokia E66 to our usual GPS battery test to see how far you can get with it. We left the device in standstill position with GPS satellites locked and the display constantly on. The E66 kept going for 6 hours straight, which is quite a good achievement, though nowhere near the unbelievable 14 hours of E71. Just as a reference, Nokia 6210 Navigator lasted about 4 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have somehow missed it by now, let's say it again - the build quality of Nokia E66 is tremendous. The phone looks great and, if it wasn't for the eye-soring red power key, we would've been tempted to say it's perfect. Anyway, we are so in love with E66, we're willing to think of it as a beauty mark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 features a 2.4" 16M-color QVGA display. Its performance is completely up to Nokia's usual high standard with great contrast and brightness. Those make the picture really vibrant and a pleasure to look at. The ambient light sensor also makes sure the display is maximum user-friendly under any kind of lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E66 screen offers the usual uncompromised legibility under direct sunlight. No matter how bright the sun outside, you can always read the display easily without trying hard finding a proper angle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is among the best we've seen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliding Nokia E66 open reveals the alphanumeric keypad which we're really fond of. It has large keys with terraced layout and great touch orientation. Press feedback levels are also commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem is the insufficient headroom for the fist row of keys, where the slider does get in the way. It can be troublesome for users with large hands but it seems the new Eseries are more interested in reducing size than accommodating this concern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the main controls on the slider, which do deserve an excellent mark too. The backlighting is also strong and pleasing to render the E66 perfect to handle in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia E66 you are extremely unlikely to experience any reception issues. Sound during calls is very clear and free of any interferences. The phone sports the really nice Smart Dialing feature, which helps you quickly find a contact straight on the standby screen. All you need to do is type some digits and all contacts with names (first or last) containing letters corresponding to them get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 sports an advanced call manager for filtering your incoming calls. You can opt for various settings - accepting only calls from your contacts, from all non-private numbers or from anyone. In addition you can set up different ringing profiles that can be scheduled to activate at a certain time (hour and day). Finally, you can also set the behavior of the phone when rejecting a call - busy tone, reject with SMS or answering machine on are some of the options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia E66 also has support for VoIP calls - you just enter your account details and you are all set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional speakerphone test with Nokia E66. Unluckily it turned out to be one of the quietest handsets we have seen so far. This means that missing a call in noisy environment is rather likely with the Nokia E66. Here is how it ranked among a few of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's Symbian S60 UI, Feature Pack 1 (and a bit of FP 2)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 runs on Symbian 9.2 OS with the Series60 3rd Edition user interface. Much like the E71, it has the Feature Pack 1 preinstalled but it benefits from a number of enhancements and upgrades inherent to Feature Pack 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 is powered by a single 369 MHz CPU and has 128MB of RAM. Those are some really good numbers in Symbian terms, allowing it to go fast and smooth with no holdups whatsoever. Even the new animations and transition effects that pervade the menu aren't causing problems. Memory Full warnings are highly unlikely and you should make quite an effort to deplete the available RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an accelerometer, which allows its user interface to automatically rotate. In fact, this is the only feature that Nokia E66 has over the E71, and is probably more of a compensation for the fact that the landscape screen is more comfortable for browsing documents and multimedia content. Nokia have learned their lesson this time and have added a nice transition animation when changing the screen orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's main menu has two view modes: a 4 x 3 grid of icons and a list. However with the E66 you cannot even opt for having animated icons as with most other Nokia phones. This is probably just another way of reiterating the business targeting of the phone. At least the font size is configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The circle next to the icon of a running application is a well known Symbian indication reminding users to quit unwanted applications that are still running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby mode goes without saying on Nokia E66. This is a nice and convenient way to bring shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access. Furthermore, each of the one-touch keys can be customized to access any feature of choice (actually two per key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two soft keys functions can also vary. If active standby mode isn't activated, you can also assign shortcuts to the directions of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 has an automatic key lock. It gets activated upon a user-defined interval with the options ranging from 5 seconds to an hour. This option can also be disabled if the user sees fit. There's even a remote lock option, which prevents your personal data from being accessed, if your phone gets stolen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novel feature in Nokia E66 allows you to toggle between two different phone setups. Each of them can be customized with its own theme and homescreen applications for maximizing usability. This way you can have a leisure and a business profile and switch between them at a single click on your home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in memory is 120MB, which is a decent figure by all means. The included 2GB microSD memory card comes in very handy for extending it but even higher capacity cards are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test showed that Nokia E66 has no problem handling an 8GB microSD card, which is the largest one currently available on the market. Accessing applications or any other files on the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice any difference compared to accessing ones in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It is launched by the dedicated key on the side of the E66 and is doing a good job, being fully speaker-independent and recognizing a very high percentage of the user commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore Nokia E66 has a built-in message reader that gets started once you press and hold the right selection key in standby. It then automatically reads all your new messages including SMS and emails.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are four preinstalled themes on Nokia E66. The rest is left to the imagination of the user, as you can download as many other themes as you wish. There is hardly anything in greater number than themes for QVGA Symbian devices out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia E66 just clicks. No changes have been made to it but we can hardly think of anything worth changing anyway. It is simply great - offering storage space for a virtually unlimited number of contacts and fields, with all the available internal memory potentially usable for the purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on your preferences, contacts on SIM or in-phone, or both at the same time get displayed. The contacts can be ordered by first or last name, and can naturally be searched by gradual typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers an enormous variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of any. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give a specific ringtone to each group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application, although not exactly a part of the phonebook, is also one of the Symbian elements. It can hold up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key in standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers. You can even filter the entries (by contact or by type), a useful feature if you're looking for a specific call.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What you get with this phone is an Eseries device with a very comfortable keypad. That probably is enough to put a broad grin on a heavy texter's face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four message editors on-board: SMS, MMS, audio and e-mail. The SMS editor is the well known intuitive application from the last few versions of Symbian S60. It has a counter of the characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that a delivery report can be activated. The reports pop up on screen, once the message reaches the addressee and are subsequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor has virtually the same interface as the one we just described, with the added subject line being the only difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio message, albeit technically a type of MMS, has its own editor with simple and easy to use interface. It can either record the message on the spot or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email is the highlight in the Nokia E66, as it supports a wide range of personal and corporate email standards such as Microsoft Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, Nokia Intellisync Wireless Email solution, along with System Seven and Visto Mobile. Encryption is also on board, as well as mobile VPN support for connecting to secure corporate Intranets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Nokia has got everything covered except for Blackberry Connect support. Nokia claims that since they are offering their own push email service similar to Blackberry Connect, they are now direct competitors and, as such, they would no longer offer Blackberry Connect support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a decision, which clearly shows that selling their email service to end customers is more important to Nokia than selling their handhelds. While this may sound perfectly reasonable to Nokia marketing department, it might make a few potential E66 buyers change their minds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Nokia have added the ultra easy email setup. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your email address and password to start enjoying emailing-on-the-go. Nokia E66 takes care of downloading all the relevant settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you can think of. Push email support is also on board, so we can hardly think of anything the E66 lacks in this department - except for the BlackBerry connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Nokia E66 is a great texting device. It has very good typing ergonomics and good software coverage and that are basically the most important things you need. Of course it can't compete to the QWERTY-enabled E71 (let alone the Nokia E90 and other similarly sized devices) but again - it was never meant to. The E66 is a phone you can comfortably slip in your pocket, and it still does more than a good job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player means business too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Normally one wouldn't expect a business-minded handset such as the Nokia E66 to have really fancy music features. In this case they'd be wrong: the music player is as good as Nseries, dubbed the multimedia flagships. Not that it costs Nokia much to put the time-proven Symbian S60 music player but it earns a point for the device nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a huge number of audio formats supported including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA. M3U playlists are also managed seamlessly and transferred files are added to the music library trouble-free by choosing the refresh option. Furthermore, upon completing a USB transfer, the phone automatically prompts scanning for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filtering tracks by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing is also at hand. This can turn out really useful if you have a really huge music collection uploaded to your E66.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and stereo widening effect. You can also create new equalizer presets if the preloaded ones won't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia E66 also includes support for the A2DP Bluetooth profile, which allows listening to music on a Bluetooth stereo headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if music is not a high priority, Nokia E66 has a rather good frequency response. However the rest of the readings in our audio quality test aren't really impressive. There is nothing too disturbing but still most of them are slightly below average. Given the business targeting of the device and the fact that we've seen Nokia do even worse, we would call the audio quality of Nokia E66 acceptable. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 features a Real player for playing your video clips. The video player works in both portrait and landscape modes, and allows switching to fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen of this size watching a video fullscreen is quite an enjoyable experience. The softkey functions are hidden, so they don't stand in the way and picture quality is good enough, so - a good general mark for Nokia E66 here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 features an FM radio too, to compliment its multimedia capabilities. It lacks RDS but the proprietary Nokia Visual radio partially makes up for that. If allowed to, it can download all the local stations and save them to the handset with their names. The bad part about it is that it cannot use a Wi-Fi connection but only network-based data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia E66 has a decently functional image gallery allowing you to do almost anything with your photos. It offers less (or more likely almost none) of the Nseries eye-candy but that isn't that much of a bother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily browse images and zoom in up to 8x. Both portrait and landscape modes are available when browsing photos. In addition, the whole browsing and zooming thing is really fast and even comparably large files aren't causing much delay. We have seen even better in some Nokias but this is a business handset we are talking about and we are more than happy with its speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the nice slide show with customizable settings, including playing a pre-defined track from your library, is mysteriously gone leaving you with manual browsing only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also offers smooth file-management functionality. Still, with the state-of-the-art file manager on Symbian you are not likely to need it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Underwhelming 3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is one element where Nokia E66 really fails to impress. The 3 megapixel resolution, the LED flash and the self-portrait mirror might seem appealing but their performance quickly ruins the good impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of lens protection is the first problem to come to mind. This means that the camera will get scratched in no time unless you use the leather case (or any other case) all the time . At least, the E66 has a dedicated camera key which makes using the autofocus snapper much more comfortable than on the E71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact this key and the camera user interface is the best part about the E66 imaging capabilities. The UI is the same as on high-profile Nokia cameraphones, offering more than extensive settings. From manual white balance and ISO sensitivity to exposure compensation, gridline, sharpness and contrast settings, as well as various effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, despite the built-in GPS, the Nokia E66 doesn't offer geotagging of its camera photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sequence mode and self-timer are no news. Sequence mode can come in handy for making time-lapse movies. The flash can be set to four positions: automatic, always on, red-eye reduction and always off. Small font tooltips are displayed to indicate what the phone is doing at each specific moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality however is below average. Pictures lack detail and noise levels are very high. The colors are also far from precise and contrast is well behind the best in business. Even in great light conditions we could hardly produce decent pictures. Hard as we try, there is little good we can say about image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the warning has been issued let's show you what the photos looks like. You can check out the sample photos made with the E66 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording is another disappointment with the E66 camera. Once again, the business mindset lets the E66 get away with the otherwise poor video maxing out at QVGA at 15 fps. As a whole, the camera is the one feature of E66 where you shouldn't expect a lot. It outranks the E71 by only the dedicated shutter key and that's the only improvement. Otherwise, it's the same awful picture quality as the QWERTY-sibling; thumbs down for the E66 camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>E-series: all about connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All right, after a few tumbles, we're back where Nokia E66 knows better than make compromises. The phone has it all in terms of connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the seemingly outdated Infrared through Bluetooth v2.0 and USB v2.0 to Wi-Fi - Nokia E66 has it all. 3G comes with HSDPA support for the fastest network data transfers around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A hot-swappable card slot is also on board, which can sometimes just be the quickest way of transferring data.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The internet browser on Symbian devices is one of their best applications. Nokia E66 makes no exceptions with great page rendering and lots of customizable options. The adjustable font size, zoom level and text wrap are all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor takes browsing another level up. It is easy to control and works like a charm. A mini-map can be activated to help navigating large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The web browser also offers landscape view and fullscreen is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the web browser is one of the most RAM-hungry applications, with the E66 you are extremely unlikely to run out of RAM even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background. The ample 2.4" display also contributes to the great browsing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final touches to the Nokia E66 browser are the built-in full Java and Flash support. This means that there is virtually no online content that your E66 can't handle. Even flash videos on the desktop-targeted YouTube and the likes are no problem, without needing a separate client.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time-management is one of the most important among them business phone virtues. That's why we wouldn't expect any less than the best from Nokia E66 and luckily that is exactly what we get. There are a lot of nice applications, all very user-friendly and functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the E71, E66 has a calendar slightly different from other Symbian devices. The month view mode now allows the events for the selected day to also appear on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other three view modes are to-do, weekly and daily and there are four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each of them has its own unique fields and some allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mobile office was the slight disappointment for us. It can still handle Word, Excel and and Powerpoint files but, unlike E71, editing isn't supported right out of the box. The extra dig aside, that's not something we would have expected in a business handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionly, there is a number of other updates and upgrades for the Quickoffice that come for a price but none of those is really essential and most users can do just fine without them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A PDF reader is also part of the Nokia E66 preinstalled content and a ZIP manager allows extracting archived files straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other prebundled organizing and time-management applications are: a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to get into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar enough. The ActiveNotes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E66 alarm clock application is also very nice. It allows a practically unlimited number of alarms to be set, each with its own name, set-off time and trigger days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the wireless presenter you can handle presentations straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The printer application enables printing content straight from your Nokia E66.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a scanning application, which uses the camera to scan business cards or text. Much like in the E71, it doesn't do too well though, failing to recognize most of the words correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sports tracker application allows you to keep track of you recent workouts and follow your improvement in time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also present in Nokia E66. Its reserved line in the active stand-by menu no longer comes as a surprise. After all, an application this useful really deserves to be conveniently placed. The application itself finds almost every item in your Nokia based on a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and results are then listed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia E66 features a dictionary with a rather rich database. English comes pre-installed and you can also download dozens of other languages for free from the Nokia download center.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the last things to cover in Nokia E66 is the built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity isn't the best you can find on the market but it can do the job if you aren't on a hurry. Our guess is that the receiver itself is the same as the one used in Nokia E71. It takes its time getting initial lock and that can be as much as 10 minutes if you cold-start it in a moving car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The added A-GPS functionality can notably reduce this time but still won't do wonders. However, this is not a Navigator, so we probably shouldn't be too demanding. Anyway, initial lock time with A-GPS is significantly better and rarely exceeds a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 comes with Nokia Maps application pre-installed. The 2.0 version is nice to work with and has very detailed map coverage of a huge number of countries and a lot of extras such as traffic information, voice-guided navigation and so on. Furthermore, Nokia E66 comes with a free three-month license for voice-guided navigation. The rest of the extra features however have to be purchased separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't want to use Nokia Maps, you can go for a third-party application, as there are quite a lot of those available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is not bad though and, with the complimentary license included, we see no reason for changing it. It has decent looks and easily customizable route planning algorithm. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and simply use the phone as an electronic map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the Nokia E66 GPS functionality is positive, with only the chip sensitivity allowing room for improvement. Still, the E66 can do the job just fine, except for those rare occasions when you will be in such a hurry that 5 or 10 minutes might be make or brake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that the E66 went on for 6 hours in our dedicated GPS test. An impressive number by all means and you can check it against some other phones we have put to the same challenge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games are also on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Business tools like the Nokia E66 aren't keen on games but we guess it doesn't hurt having some aboard. Especially when the two preinstalled titles are so good. The first is a collection of card games including15 games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is an arcade-style car racer with rather decent graphics. The Racing Thunder has a really simple gameplay but isn't nearly as easy getting good at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are to take gaming more seriously than that, sky is the limit, as there is an enormous amount of games for Symbian online.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with the upgrader's point of view, we'd say a jump from E65 to the E66 is totally worth it. The phone has improved in nearly every area compared to its predecessor and addresses most of its issues. The price tag is still slightly on the steep side but we guess it will be a great bargain in no time. And even as it stands now, the Nokia E66 still is a great purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximizing the reach with one and the same styling and feature sets used across different form factor is no news in the industry. Think Nokia 6500 classic and slide, or the Samsung Soul lineup, if you will. With Nokia E66 and E71 though, it's so easy on the user with almost complete replicas available in different design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, Nokia E66 is as good for business as its QWERTY peer. It might not have the stamina and keypad of the powerful E71 but that was hardly the objective in the first place. We like the E66 for being a worthy alternative in terms of shape and looks, without compromising performance. It adds a pinch of fun to the whole thing too, coming out as more of an all-round device than strictly a business tool.</paragraph>
