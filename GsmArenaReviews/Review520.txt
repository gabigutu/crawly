			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: voting is now closed! Which phone hides behind which letter is revealed on Page 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, the iPhone 6s Plus and the Galaxy S6 edge+ - two behemoths of the smartphone world. That's a lot of S's, and 6's, and Plus's and it sure gets confusing when choosing between those two. The iPhone 6s Plus finally got the long overdue camera upgrade with more megapixels and 4K video, while Samsung has tweaked further the camera used on the Galaxy S6 generation flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're sure many among you are wondering which one of these two extremely expensive devices would make a better smartphone. We'd love to chime in with our opinion and we couldn't wait putting the hottest phablets of the season head to head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The detailed comparison review however is due out for tomorrow. For the time being, you're welcome to pick your favorite in our blind camera test featuring the two smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you've gone through the voting, we're sure you will be itching to learn which one is A and which one - B. We'll update this article with this information tomorrow - around 14h UK time along with the results from the voting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we've resized all the samples down to 1600 x 1200 pixels - that's the typical size most people will use them on social networks or email/IM sharing, and thus it would be easier to observe which camera would suit you better. There is also a 1:1 crop comparison between if you'd like to check out the detail from up close. We've shot all samples using the 4:3 aspect ratio setting on the Galaxy S6 edge+ as opposed to the native 16:9 aspect ratio just so we facilitate this blind test. In 4:3 aspect ratio the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ outputs photos in 12MP resolution and that makes it a lot easier to compare head to head with the iPhone 6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough chit-chat, it's show time!</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #1: Daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first test is a daylight scene. We suggest you observe the general colors, the exposure and contrast. If you are a pixel-peeper, you can also use the provided crop to evaluate the overall processing, the resolved detail, and the noise levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #2: Daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second test is mostly about the dynamic range though you might as well use it to evaluate the general stuff like in the scene above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to dynamic range, it's worth paying attention how much of the shadow detail has been captured without sacrificing the highlights. Make note that sometimes incorrect brightness and contrast settings on your computer screen may play a huge role in determining the winner in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #3: Indoors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The third one is an indoors scene. We've got a high-contrasty scene where not everything is lit perfectly. Noise is quite likely to creep up in the shadows and cameras with poor dynamic range will most certainly fail in capturing this scene properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #4: Dusk landscape<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next task is a dusk landscape. In this case we don't expect much of the fine detail to be captured. Instead, in this scene we focus on the general colors and exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #5: Night time cityscape<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sixth topic is an urban scene at night. You should probably make your call based on the general colors and exposure, as well as based on the resolved detail and the amount of the digital noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #6: Flash test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here comes the flash test. The iPhone 6s Plus has a dual-tone flash, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ has a regular single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scene #7: 4K video daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally, we come to the 4K video capabilities of the two phones. The images below are full resolution screenshots from the respective 4K videos, while the crop gives you a more direct comparison so you can evaluate the resolved detail and the specific processing patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for the winner in this scene above:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voting is now open and the results will be announced tomorrow, October 15 at around 2pm UK time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Blind test: the reveal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time to tally the votes - you have had 24 hours to pick your favorite cameraphone based on a few sample photos plus one video screencap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PHONE A is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PHONE B is the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones offer different field of view, but we tried our best to make this blind test as fair as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results are roughly what we expected them - the Galaxy S6 edge+ won in all but the most demanding daylight and low-light scenes. The iPhone 6s Plus seems better suited to handle sunsets and dusk scenery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a short summary of the votes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first scene explored the capabilities of both cameras in broad daylight. The Galaxy S6 edge+ image is sharper, with more resolved detail and punchy colors. The iPhone's on the other hand offers more realistic color rendering, better exposure and while it lacks the sharpness of the Galaxy, it's still a good one. About 57% of the votes went for the Galaxy S6 edge+, which means our readers prefer more detail and punchier colors than soft images with a more realistic look. on the other hand, 57% is not a surefire win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second daylight scene was specifically chosen to strain the dynamic range of the camera sensors. The iPhone 6s Plus did noticeably better here revealing a lot more detail in the shadows. Both cameras had their HDR options turned off for this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>About 82% of the voters chose the iPhone's higher dynamic range sample before the Galaxy's so it looks like a sure victory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The indoors scene was shot in a shopping mall and while both devices did very well, the Galaxy S6 edge+ is less noisy and captured more detail. About 73% of the votes are indeed in favor of the Galaxy smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dusk sceneries have always looked gorgeous and are often captured with various devices, including smartphones. We tried one with our rivals here, too, and the results and the votes are a mixed bag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S6 edge+ sample is brighter than it should be and while it may look better downsized, the iPhone's image is much closer to reality. It has more detail, less smudged detail by noise and due to lack of overexposure you can notice more clouds in the sky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voting here was tougher apparently, partially because of the Android/iOS bias and partially because of the demanding scene. Oddly, the Galaxy S6 edge+ won, but just by a whisker at 54% vs 46% for the iPhone 6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The night shots are an absolute nightmare for the mobile cameras. While the Galaxy and the iPhone shots look horrible in 1:1 magnification, the iPhone still did better overall - it used a lower shutter speed and lower ISO and thus retained more detail. The white balance and the exposure are better on the iPhone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>About 74% of the votes went for the iPhone 6s Plus. Check out the full resolution samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd expected the iPhone's dual-tone dual-LED flash to do better than the single-LED flash on the Galaxy S6 edge+, but we were wrong. The only thing the iPhone did better is to keep some of the detail in the background. The Galaxy's processing is much better, as is the resolved detail, white balance and color rendering. About 93% of our readers thought the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are the full-res samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, on the 4K video test the iPhone 6s Plus is in disadvantage as it has a forced software stabilization all the time and thus it has a narrower field of view. The Galaxy's video has more detail while still capturing more objects in the frame, which made if a favorite among 81% of our readers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our complete comparison review of both devices is due later today, so stay tuned!</paragraph>
