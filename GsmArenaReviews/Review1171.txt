			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the dust still settling from one of the most exciting smartphone battles the industry has seen, and clouds of stardust swirling around a complete review, it's time to step back and take a sober look at two great phones. Two glorious chapters in Android history, two milestones on Samsung's rise to the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping a cool head about gadgets like these two isn't the easiest of things but one has to be calm and rational in matters of upgrade and, ultimately, money. To get the obvious out of the way, the Samsung Galaxy S III boasts a massive HD screen and double the CPU cores of its predecessor. It's as simple as that - and more than enough for most people. What we're trying to do here is look closer at the differences between the two generations and find out what the upgrade costs and what it's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III is clearly the better equipped phone - it bests the S II on practically every count - but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right Galaxy S for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick list we threw together to help you get an idea of what Samsung improved on with the S III, but also why an S II might still be a smart buy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Why the Galaxy S III is better<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Why the Galaxy S II is still good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of all the reasons listed, price is perhaps the biggest ace up the Galaxy S II's sleeve. Yes, it's gotten old, but it remains a very solid device, albeit in an upper-midrange position. Then there's the vibrant developer community around the S II, which might give it Android 5.0 Jellybean, even if Samsung decide not to do that officially.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, if you are after the cr?me de la cr?me in Android, the list is pretty short and the SGS III is on it. Samsung have treated the Galaxy S III as a droid royalty and the smartphone is getting plenty of cool accessories (wireless charging, AllShare Cast, the Pebble), fancy software (S Voice, etc.) and it's practically a lock for a Jellybean update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the full picture, we'll need to look at hardware and software, performance and camera. The next page kicks things off with a look at the hardware and the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III continues the trend in the Galaxy S series to make the screen bigger and better. The S II has a 4.3" screen (though later incarnations grew to 4.5"-4.65"), while the S III jumps straight to the head of the pack of what still counts as a phone, with its 4.8" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That extra half-an-inch (12.7mm) comes at a cost though - the Galaxy S III is 11.3mm taller and 4.5mm wider than its predecessor. What you get is nearly 11 square centimeters of extra screen real-estate. We'll get back to the screen itself later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone it technically thicker - 8.6mm vs. 8.5mm for the S II - but its thickness is a lot more evenly spread (the S II has a hump on the lower back and around the camera). The Galaxy S III has only a small bump around the lens and its tapered edges make it feel even thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outside of the Samsung Galaxy S III comes in Blue and White varieties, where the Blue has a sort of brushed metal look. Samsung calls the plastic used in the S III "hyperglazed", which means there's a transparent layer on top of the colored plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be honest - it doesn't look quite as inspiring as some of its competitors that pack fancy polycarbonate or aluminum unibodies. The Galaxy S II uses a regular, patterned plastic for the back and while it was nothing extraordinary, it looks a little better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least, the Galaxy S III stuck with the user-replaceable battery and the microSD card slot you can use to expand the memory, so it's not losing any points here. Samsung made the switch to microSIM (so if you're upgrading, you'll need to ask your carrier for a new SIM or cut the old one down to size), but at least they've moved the microSD slot away from the battery and it's now hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of batteries, the S III comes with an impressive battery - not Motorola RAZR MAXX big, but big nonetheless. The latest in the S series has a 2,100mAh Li-Ion power pack, which is 450mAh more than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery alone isn't the whole story though - there's a new chipset and a new screen in play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3G talk time went up to 10 hours and 20 minutes (up from 8 hours and 35 minutes) for an S II running ICS. With two extra hours of video run time, it now lasts 10 hours. Web browsing meanwhile stayed pretty much the same - a little over 5 hours. That's not bad, considering the extra screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, our battery rating for the Samsung Galaxy S III is 43 hours - virtually the same as the 42 hour rating that an ICS-running S II got. Less efficient standby is what kept the S III from scoring higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even though you'll need to charge the S III as often, at least you may get to squeeze in some extra talk time or watch another episode of that TV show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III supports wireless charging, though the launch of the wireless charger was delayed. You can get a third-party solution for the Galaxy S II, but having a genuine accessory is usually the better option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen - WVGA RGB vs. 720p PenTile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III is technically not the first Samsung smartphone with a 720p resolution screen. There is the Galaxy Nexus and also the Galaxy Note. A couple of Galaxy S II variants have also dabbled with 720p, but one of them got canceled before it even made it to the factories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the increase in resolution means that the Galaxy S III has 300+ ppi pixel density, despite its larger screen. That compares quite favorably to the 217ppi density of the S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matter of matrix type is often hotly disputed - PenTile vs. RGB. But it's hardly a contest, the pixels on the Galaxy S III screen are so tiny that they don't become apparent until you're looking at the screen from much too short a distance (our eyes start hurting even before this point). The Galaxy S II screen is very good too, but it just can't match the sharpness of the 720p unit when it comes to tiny text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upside of going with PenTile, according to Samsung, is that the panel's life is increased compared to RGB panels and their picture quality lasts longer. Samsung says the S III screen will remain in excellent condition even after two, three years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had a Galaxy S II in our office for over an year now and if there is degradation, it's too subtle and gradual to notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, resolution isn't the whole story. The Galaxy S III screen is slightly dimmer than the one on the S II, but much brighter than the 720p Super AMOLED of the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gorilla Glass 2-covered screen does noticeably better in bright sunlight despite the slightly lower brightness. Actually, the Galaxy S III is the best performer in this category that we've seen since we started running the test. It beats even the excellent ClearBlack display of a Nokia N9 and is well ahead of the iPhone 4S screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II isn't a bad performer in this category though - it comes somewhere between the N9 and the 4S. It comes pretty close to the brand new HTC One S and has slightly higher subpixel density than it too, so it's fair to say it does well against newer competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III has an interesting add-on - an RGB ambient light sensor. We've contacted Samsung about it and they say typical ambient light sensors detect only green light (it's the one the human eye is most sensitive to), but they don't work too well under fluorescent lighting. The RGB sensor detects all visible light and supposedly makes better adjustments to the screen brightness.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Software and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S II and the new model run Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with TouchWiz on top. And while the general interface is quite similar, the one on the Galaxy S III is more polished and it includes even more goodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen for one is much more functional - four shortcuts, weather forecast, dual-clock when roaming, news ticker and nature inspired aesthetics are appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ICS brought face unlock to the S II, but the Galaxy S III takes things a step further - Smart Stay uses the front-mounted camera to make sure the phone never locks or even dims its screen while you're in the middle something. The whole face detection thing also got into the gallery with Buddy photo share and Social tag able to recognize people's faces and allow easier to access their contact and SNS info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging on the S III also got improved with some clever features - direct call allows you to put the phone up to your ear and dial the contact whose info or text message you were just looking at. Smart alert will have the phone vibrate when you pick it up to notify of missed events - that's great for the times you just grab the phone without even looking at the notification LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few other nice tricks (double tap the top of the phone to scroll to the beginning of some lists, Pop up play and so on), but the biggest potential game-changer that the latest Galaxy S brought was S Voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've covered S Voice in a blog post and in the S III's review, so you know it needs more work done, but it still doesn't seem ready to enter your daily routine. You still might prefer it over Apple's Siri though - particularly if you're a Spanish, Italian or a Korean speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy phones typically come with an AllShare app that serves DLNA duties. The Galaxy S III, however, adds AllShare Cast support, which uses a wireless dongle to stream HD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III also brings MusicSquare along with updated sound-enhancing technologies. MusicSquare is similar to Sony Ericsson's SensMe and builds playlists automatically based on the desired mood of the songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II was one of the first devices to support Wi-Fi Direct - a technology that combines the easy pairing of Bluetooth with the high speeds of Wi-Fi. The S III builds on that with S Beam - the data is still channeled over Wi-Fi Direct but the pairing procedure has become as simple as humanly possible over NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest weakness of S Beam is that currently only the Galaxy S III supports it, but Samsung is sure to put it on more phones. As for inter-maker compatibility, the Galaxy S III can still do the simple-but-slow NFC transfer or the fast-but-slightly-more-complicated Wi-Fi Direct transfer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the S II and S III can do fast Bluetooth 3.0 transfers too, but the S III tacks on Bluetooth 4.0 LE for accessories with low-power, low-bandwidth needs (think heart rate monitors, smart watches, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knowing the Galaxy S phones are surrounded by an active hacker community, a lot of these software tricks have a very good chance of landing on the old Galaxy S II.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks - supercharged performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S II and S III use Exynos chipsets of the house with Cortex-A9 CPU cores and Mali-400 GPU. The S III has double the CPU cores (which are also clocked slightly higher) and it's clear that the GPU either has more cores or has been overclocked (Samsung doesn't say which one it is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III shows a pretty decent increase in single-threaded performance over the S II as revealed by BenchmarkPi, considering the increase in clock speed is only 200MHz.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting all the cores to work results in a more than double increase in performance for the Galaxy S III - which is what you would expect of a quad-core phone (and with higher CPU clock at that). Not all CPU loads are as nicely multithreaded as Linpack, however, so that's about the maximum speed increase we can expect to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant highly appreciates the overall performance enhancements that Samsung built into the Galaxy S III, showing a massive advantage for the newer phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 and GLBenchmark show that the Mali-400 GPUs inside both Galaxies are not the same. NenaMark runs at display resolution - meaning the Galaxy S III has 140% more pixels to work with and it still beats its predecessor (and comes very close to the 60fps sweet spot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark runs offscreen at 720p resolution - putting both phones on equal footing. The benchmark shows a 62% performance increase, but again, it's not clear if it's more cores or higher clock speed (or both) that causes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Galaxy S II turns up very playable framerates, so even if the graphics on its screen won't be as sharp as on the S III, it's still a good portable gaming machine (on par with NVIDIA's GPU inside the Tegra 3, assuming equal resolution).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark Egypt (offscreen 720p)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are the browser benchmarks. The Galaxy S III is a speed freak, but the S II holds its ground. It's still one of the highest scoring phones in SunSpider and BrowserMark alike. You're unlikely to notice major differences in browsing speed on either phone (but the extra sharp screen on the S III sure is nice).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera - how 8MP beats 8MP<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the face of it, both cameras are the same - 8MP with LED flash. But the camera unit in the Galaxy S III is different than the one used in the S II and the differences are not too trivial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The set of features each camera offers is the first change you're likely to encounter. The S III uses its extra processing power to do things like full resolution burst shots (up to 20 photos), take full-res 16:9 photos while recording 1080p video, snap 8 photos and pick the best one automatically and recognizing people right after the shot is taken (no just detecting human faces, the S III can tell who is who).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image quality is concerned, Samsung changed the way photos are processed in the Galaxy S III. Photos have better contrast compared to the S II and color balance is a tad more accurate. The S III boosts the green channel more than the S II, which gives its photos a slightly different look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of resolved detail has gone up a notch and the noise levels have gotten very low. It's not a drastic upgrade and photos from the Galaxy S II are still pretty good, though the S III manages to resolve the thin lines that the S II smudges away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you factor in the slightly wider viewing angle of the Galaxy S III, it's not a bad overall improvement, but the jump in quality isn't quite like the one we got when moving from the Galaxy S to the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepared a couple of 100% crops from the photos to highlight the differences between the two cameras - the amount of resolved detail, the noise and color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning to our Photo Compare Tool for confirmation, the ISO chart clearly shows the increase in both horizontal and vertical resolution - it's not much, but it's there. The noise reduction doesn't appear to have been boosted (the gravel, grass and white noise patches look the same), but the level of noise has gone down noticeably (look at the grey background or the color patches).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under artificial lighting (the third chart), the Galaxy S III processing settles on a better white balance (S II photos have a tint).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II and S III both shoot 1080p videos at maximum, though as we saw with the still camera, that doesn't necessarily mean they have the same quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty similar on both phones, with the exception of the virtual shutter key available on the Galaxy S III. You know, it can snap full-resolution 16:9 stills while shooting video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones shoot 1080p videos at 17Mbps in MP4 containers and stereo sound with about 130Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A welcome upgrade in the S III is that the field of view doesn't change when you switch from 1080p to 720p. On the S II, 1080p samples used to have a narrower field of view and you had to switch to 720p if you needed to fit more into the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy S III, however, you get pretty much identical framing for both video resolutions - slightly more than you get from the S II in 720p mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This puts the S III at a bit of a disadvantage - because it fits more things in the frame, there are fewer pixels available to draw each object (as the resolution is equal). Still, the phone performs admirably - there's plenty of fine detail, no jaggies or compression artifacts, no noise either. The Galaxy S II is still a good 1080p shooter, but its videos are softer, with less detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our toy Ferris wheel setup makes the difference clear. In the Galaxy S III videos, the grass looks much better, the banner text is sharper and more readable, the wooden planks are more clearly defined and the shadows are resolved much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S III maintains the advantage under low light - the banner text is still legible and the grass is recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our ISO chart shows noticeably improved resolution (both horizontally and vertically), the Galaxy S III is one of the best 1080p shooters in our database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S III vs. Galaxy S II in the Video Compare Tool </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 100% crop from our setup pinpoints the improvements in image quality. In some areas, the difference is quite stunning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If it's just a matter of which of the two phones we'd like to have in our pocket, the answer is a straightforward "Galaxy S III, please". The S II was a trusted companion, but it no longer tickles our inner geek, while the S III feels like it comes from the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the checkout, we started having second thoughts - the Galaxy S II will easily remain a great phone for another year, even if not quite as good as its successor. So, if you already have it and are not too keen to spend, it will easily last you till the Galaxy S IV, which is sure to come some time next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are murkier for those who don't already have a Galaxy S II though - sure, the phone is cheaper now, but is it worth spending money on a phone that already has a few gray hairs?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the long run, a Galaxy S III (if you can afford it) is the better choice - it won't have aged that much by next year (when the S II will be old and creaky) and you would have gotten to use the better smartphone of the two during that time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, its resale value will be higher after a year, so the cash you've spent for owning the phone might not be much more than getting an S II now only to sell it dirt cheap later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, this conclusion will shock no one - the newer phone is better and that's hardly a surprise. But the thing is, if you had to choose which one to buy just now, the S III is better by just enough to make spending the extra cash worthwhile.</paragraph>
