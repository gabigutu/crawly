			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel showed its sporty side with two Go devices - the OneTouch Go Play smartphone and the Go Watch smartwatch. Both brave the elements and can control a GoPro action cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Alcatel OneTouch Xess tablet, a whopping 17.3" device for the home. More specifically for the kitchen - no, really, Alcatel has deals in place with cooking channels and everything.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OneTouch Go Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel OneTouch Go Play is a sporty phone for outdoorsy types. It's IP67 rated, but goes further than that ? it can handle salt water too (IP ratings are for fresh water only). The phone comes with an 8MP/1080p camera on the back, but you can buy a case that lets you attach your GoPro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Go Play will cost under $200, meaning even the cheapest GoPro camera will cost more than the phone itself. Still, if you want two separate devices this is one way to go about it. One potential downside for shooting adventure videos with the Go Play alone is that you get only 4GB out of the 8GB storage, so you'll have to buy a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone itself feels lighter than we expected from a rugged phone, the 2,500mAh battery doesn?t scream "endurance" either. The 5" screen has 720p resolution, the contrast was fairly nice but the viewing angles weren?t very good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Go Watch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the same family as the Go Play, the Alcatel Go Watch also has an IP67 rating and GoPro integration. It can serve as a remote viewfinder and control the action cam, for under $150. Keep in mind that GoPro's Smart Remote is $80 alone and the watch features a heart rate sensor and an altimeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen (1.22", 240 x 240px) looks quite decent by smartphone standards but we found the UI a bit laggy. On the plus side it supports both Android and iOS devices. This isn?t an Android Wear watch by the way, it runs proprietary software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wrist bands and plastic casing of the Alcatel Go Watch can be exchanged easily ? to try out a new color combo or just because you damaged the old casing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel OneTouch Xess<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Whoo boy, that's a huge tablet ? the Alcatel OneTouch Xess features a whopping 17.3" touchscreen (it's pronounced "excess" if you couldn?t tell). That's bigger than most laptops, the thing weighs 2kg (4.4lbs). The stainless steel body does look pretty awesome though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, it's not meant for use on the go. It does have a 10,000mAh battery so it can go without a charger for quite a while too. The big kickstand/handle makes it clear this is an at-home tablet. You can prop up the Xess on a table or hang in on a wall. The stand snaps to 30°, 50° and 75°, it also hides a stylus behind it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel sees the OneTouch Xess being used in the kitchen ? you can control it without touching it with your greasy fingers while cooking. The company says it has secured deals with various cooking channels, the tablet will come preloaded with cooking apps and a shopping list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can also be used as a replacement for an all-in-one PC. The 17.3" screen has 1080p resolution ? low for a tablet, okay for a desktop monitor ? and you get two full-size USB ports plus 3W dual speakers from JBL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t get a price for this one, but we can't imagine it will be cheap.</paragraph>
