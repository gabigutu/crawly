			<paragraph>Nokia N71 is another Symbian 9.1 smartphone in the collection of Nokia. The new clamshell is well equipped and is aimed in the mid-range of customers. It is based on the S60 3rd edition user interface. N71 has 3G UMTS support and can offer fast data transfer via GPRS and EDGE. Besides the 2 megapixel camera there is also a VGA one for video calls. The construction and design of the phone are quite controversial as it is bulky and somewhat unstable in hand, but this, of course, is a matter of personal taste.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 is based on the 3rd edition Series 60 Nokia user interface and thus is very much alike Nokia N80, E60 and N91. All four phones have huge possibilities but lack software as the S60 UI is brand new and the developers have not yet produced applications for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Grey and silver<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 looks and feels very big for a clamshell. The phone is rather thick and wide. The design is well balanced in the two-color scheme of gray and silver outlining. Its dimensions are 98.6 x 51.2 x 25.8 mm and when you hold it in your hand you will feel frustrated with the sheer volume of this piece. It is heavy too, 139 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N71 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are people who like solid, massive phones and they will most definitely enjoy Nokia N71 but it is much too big for our taste - especially when it comes to clamshells.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Massive but not solid<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A big surprise in N71 is that although it is a big phone and is supposed to be very stable, there are some construction mishaps in it. The most major one is the top part of the clamshell. When it is closed, it plays a bit to the both sides. Probably that comes from the poor hinging of the two parts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing mechanism, however, works perfectly. It produces a click sound so you would know when you have reached the desired position. Nokia N71 has two opened positions. The first is for video calls and the phone is not fully opened yet. We usually call this a "sitting" position since in that position the phone is made to "sit" on your desk while you are making a video call. If you go all the way, it will seamlessly open entirely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Semi-opened and fully opened N71</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel consists of grey plastic and shelters the external display silver frame. On top of the display is located a NOKIA sign and below it is the functional key. This key is used for silencing or rejecting incoming calls, pausing and playing music, etc. The camera lens and the flash LED are beneath the silver frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N71 front ? Camera lens and LED flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone has a very clean design and only has a white NOKIA sign on the very top and the battery cover with its release clip. The bottom of the back side of the phone is bordered with silver plastic. The battery and the cover are one whole set - the capacity of the Li-Ion battery itself is 970 mAh. It is integrated with the plastic cover with the use of plastic clips. The SIM card slot is in the top part of the battery bed and the card needs to be pushed inside the phone's body and then be pressed by the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N71 back ? Under the battery cover ? The SIM card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone is for the loud speaker grill and the Infrared port. The port is on the top and the grill is located on the bottom. The right lateral side of the phone is empty. The bottom of the closed device holds the On/Off/Profiles button. It is located on the front panel's bottom. The back panel's bottom doesn't have anything on it. The top of N71 is reserved for the clamshell mechanism which is in silver, the Pop-Port connector and the miniSD memory card slot. The slot is protected by a tiny plastic which I, myself, consider unstable and easy to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N71 left side ? Right side ? Bottom ? On/Off/Profiles button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When opened, the phone's top part consists of the main speaker on the top, a small N71 sign on the left, the video call VGA camera on the right and the main display grey frame. The bottom part of the opened device is reserved for the keypad and the microphone on its bottom. They keypad is divided in two.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SMS is just fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Nokia N71 is practically good. It is separated in two parts, top and bottom. The top part is with the functional and navigation keys. Alone in the very top is the Multimedia button. When pressed, this key brings up the Multimedia Menu. Below it is the four-way navigation key with confirmation button in its middle. This is quite confusing as the four ways aren't easy to press without special effort and you may press different way by mistake. Surrounding the navigation key are the two soft keys and the red and green receiver keys On the next row are located the Pencil, Menu and C correction buttons.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The bottom part of the keypad is for the alphanumeric keys. They are very well elaborated and can be easily distinguished in the dark. All keys on the keypad, except for the navigation key, are made of grey plastic and leave good touch impressions. The four-way navigation key is made of silver metal. The keypad backlighting is great, except there is one interesting issue. The backlight illuminates all buttons except the top Multimedia key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good, even great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 has a 256K colors display with 320 x 240 pixels resolution. The manufacturer, however, has already shown to the public better displays in their previous models N90, N80 &amp; E60 to say for example. This display performs very well both in good and bad light conditions. It is large enough to enable the phone to display its features. The displayed picture is vivid and sharp and the backlighting of the display is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   N71 display ? Display backlighting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When active, the external display is 65K colors with 96 x 68 pixels resolution and displays the date and time and the operator name. When inactive, it displays the time but the clock is rather illegible. It can also display the played track if you are listening to music and shows the caller's number and picture if any when receiving calls. Missed calls and received messages are also displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    External display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Network signal reception is perfect and sound quality during calls is at a great level.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S60, the IIIrd<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Series 60 3rd edition user interface is not an innovation anymore. It is well known from the reviews of Nokia N80, N91 and E60. Nokia N71 is another smartphone with Symbian 9.1 which runs on the S60 3rd edition user interface. The active stand-by display of the phone shows the network signal strength, date &amp; time, operator name and battery level on its top row. Below it is a row of the most used applications and a list of organizer and calls information like calendar tasks, notes and missed calls and received messages. The labels of the applications assigned to the two soft keys are located in the very bottom of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N71 main active display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is available in two views: matrix grid and listed view. The matrix grid is based of 3 x 4 icons and the listed view shows 5 icons at a time. The sub-menus are both in grid and listed view but most of them cannot be changed. The Multimedia menu is another option in the phone and can be brought up by pressing the Multimedia button. It opens a four-way animated menu with four assigned applications that can be changed by the user's preference. Nokia N71 performs very well in matter of speed. There aren't any major lags in the phone response and that makes working with the phone an easy job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Main menu in two different themes ? My own sub-menu ? Multimedia menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has 10 MB internal memory and a 128 MB miniSD card in the package (market dependent) for expanding the memory. As the phone supports MP3/AAC/MPEG4 file formats, it can be used as a music player but it is not what it is made to do. It is mostly for satisfying the needs of the users who want their phone to have a bit more than just the basic features of the modern mobile phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>N71 phonebook is the same as in any other Nokia Symbian phone. It uses the shared internal memory of the phone and has almost 11 MB as a limit. Contacts can be ordered either by first or last name and are searched by gradually typing the contact's name letter by letter. They can also be organized in groups but cannot be used as a calls filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Phonebook capacity ? Browsing the phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a large amount of available fields which can be assigned to a contact. Starting with Title, First &amp; Last name, Suffix, Company, Job title, Nickname, Mobile, Office, Home phone numbers, Video call phone numbers, Internet telephone, PTT, Fax, Pager, email addresses, web addresses, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Assigning different fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personalized pictures and ringtones are supported as well. When a contact of your phonebook is calling you, a picture of your choice is displayed on the screen next to his name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The log<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 calls log is separated in four tabs: Recent calls, Dialed Numbers, Received calls, Missed calls. The Recent calls tab contains all calls made with the phone in the last 30 days while the other tabs shows the last 10 calls in every category. Every record of a call shows the call duration, date and time of the execution of the call and the number you've talked with.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging all-in-one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging menu of Nokia N71 has an Inbox for all SMS, MMS, EMS messages and files received through Bluetooth or Infrared. The received emails are stored in a separate inbox. Writing messages is very easy with N71 as the keypad is comfortable and allows the user to write fast. There is a T9 dictionary to assist the writing process. There is a character counter in top part of the display which shows the characters left until the message will be divided in two or more parts. Next to the characters number there is a number in brackets which tells you the numbers of messages that will be sent. The messages editor and reader display up to 7 rows en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Inbox ? Reading a message ? Writing a message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works very well and handles POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols. N71 downloads and opens attachments seamlessly. The email inbox displays the new messages highlighted so you would know which emails are still unread.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music in the background<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As in previous S60 3rd edition Nokia smartphones, N71 offers the same music player with an equalizer and playlist support. The phone allows music to be played in the background as the track is displayed on the active stand-by display below the calendar information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Music player ? Running in background</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has FM radio but you have to plug in the head speakers in order to listen to the radio as their cable serves as an antenna. The radio is very easy and intuitive to use and can remember your favorite stations once you've set them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great results, great performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 has a very good 2 megapixel camera. The camera application is very similar to the one in Nokia N80, just adjusted for portrait shooting and in many aspects the N71 camera is a 2 megapixel version of the N80 camera. In fact, it is a lot more convenient to use the Nokia N71 camera for sightseeing for example. You will have to start the camera application only once. When you are not shooting, you can just close the clamshell. If you need it again, you can just open the clamshell and the camera is ready to take the picture immediately. We didn't had Nokia N80 along with N71 to compare the performance, but in all camera operations, N71 seemed faster - this is easily explainable - Nokia N71 has to work with smaller images (2 MP vs. 3 MP) and also has lower resolution display, less pixels to draw. However, Nokia N71 lacks the macro mode we can find on N80.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a lot of shooting modes like Portrait, Landscape, Sport, Text, which is very convenient. The exposure compensation and the white balance can be adjusted without pressing too many buttons. Of course, you can select to store your photos in lower resolution or with higher compression. A LED flash should help you in shooting close objects in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Using LED flash in complete darkness</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the Nokia N71 photos is a pleasant surprise - low noise (look at the sky in the samples), true colors and high dynamic range for a phone (no over exposure). We notice a little underexposure in the N71 photos, but this is definitely a better approach than blowing the highlights, it's really easy to adjust the exposure later on the PC. If you like your photos brighter in the first place, you can always use the exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For everything except macro shots Nokia N71 can rival the top rated 2 megapixel cameras of Sony Ericsson K750 and friends. You can see how K750 performs at the same scenes in our 3 megapixel shootout, K750 was a honorable referee there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Full size photo samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>           Photos resampled to 1024 x 768 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At highest setting Nokia N71 can shoot video in MP4 format and CIF resolution (352 x 288 pixels). The quality of the video is on par with N80 and it is a lot better than what we usually get in the phones. Capturing in 3GP format is also possible. The digital zoom can be used during shooting, the exposure and the white balance can be adjusted.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can look at your photos with the help of the Gallery application. It uses the same rotating view as in Nokia N80, but in portrait mode. The thumbnails of the pictures are read ahead and cached. Once read, all operations within the Gallery are very fast.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Seamlessly connect to almost anything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 has Bluetooth, Infrared and USB connectivity options and they work so easily that you can connect to almost anything that supports these standards. There are applications to install a Bluetooth keyboard and use it with the phone and there is another application for setting a printer to print files from N71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Connectivity menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization with PC is seamless with the Nokia PC Suite. There is also a Nokia Xpress Transfer application for fast transfer of files from your phone to your PC or backwards.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Perfect browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of Nokia N71 is the same as in N80 and E60, but as the display has lower resolution, N71 displays less on its screen. It works great and offers powerful features. There is a mouse cursor that can be navigated easily, you can switch between different pages and you can zoom the part of the page you are in interested in. The browser supports flash clips and most Java scripts. An intriguing fact is that Nokia N71 (as well as N80 and E60) has two different browsers. One of them is this advanced one and the other is an old Symbian browser, which was used in earlier models.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multi-tasking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 has an Organizer menu and a Calendar icon in the main menu. This is quite confusing but is not unusual. The Calendar has Monthly, Weekly and Daily view. You can assign Meeting, Anniversary, Memo and To-do tasks in the Calendar. You can also put alarms on those assignments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calendar: monthky &amp; weekly views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can open office Word and Excel documents but cannot edit them. You can only zoom in and out and read the files. There is a dual clock application in the phone. You can set two different times and dates in two time zones. You can set alarms from the Clock application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Word document ? Excel document</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Organizer menu consists of Notes, Converter, Calculator and Recorder applications. The Converter converts Currencies, Area, Energy, Length, Mass, Power, Pressure, Temperature, Time, Velocity and Volume. The calculator is very simple and easy to use. Regrettably, the Recorder has a one minute limit for voice records. This seems quite illogical since the phone has enough internal memory and a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator ? Recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile security and blogging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An intriguing thing is that the Nokia N71 has an anti-virus application. It is the F-Security application which protects your phone from mobile virus attacks. Another interesting application is the Lifeblog feature which is for mobile blogging which is becoming increasingly popular nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Imaging and My own sub-menus</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D Snake<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 has two preinstalled games, Snake and Card Deck. The Card Deck game is a pack of popular card games like Klondike and Golf. The Snake game is a new 3D labyrinth of the popular Nokia Snake game. We must admit that it offers quite an amusing and addictive gameplay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Card Deck ? Snake</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controversial choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N71 definitely has its great sides and can offer much to the end users but lacks design touch and due to its bulky size will repulse many customers. Of course, there are people who enjoy bigger phones and will like the new Symbian Nokia but probably for the majority of us N71 won't be the first choice of preference.</paragraph>
