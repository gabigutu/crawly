			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of a kind would be a massive overstatement but there's something about the Nokia 6760 slide that's clearly against the usual run of things. Full QWERTY keyboards are an increasingly common sight on Symbian smartphones so this can't be it. However, the Nokia 6760 slide is a generic messenger - noting to do with Nseries, Eseries or even XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, the 6760 slide was first seen and used in the US as Nokia Surge. It usually takes quite a while for Nokia handsets to cross the pond and that makes the 6760 / Surge concept interesting enough. Whether it was custom made for AT&amp;T and then given a go at home is irrelevant. Nokia now have a smart messenger ready to roll in the lower midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new 6760 slide (we'll use its European name from now on) is ultra compact and the full-QWERTY keyboard is backed by no numpad on top. The Internet and Messaging shortcuts up front are quite handy though and make perfect sense in both portrait and landscape hand hold. The neat messenger is trying to balance features, looks and ergonomics to offer all-round experience within budget. The absence of Wi-Fi support is a letdown, but the rest of the features are from the top drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian-driven Nokia 6760 slide has a responsive and fast user interface and offers various social networking integration. The good web browser and robust messaging should be welcomed by users with a solid data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We called it a generic messenger and there's nothing really impressive about the idea behind this device - unless you've never seen or heard of E75 or 5730 XpressMusic. Not to mention the N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, an ultra compact Symbian smartphone with a full QWERTY keyboard seems to make sense. The 6760 slide certainly misses on some features but it does well to position itself as a typical carrier's handset. Fast data, solid messaging and friendly size will perhaps convince enough users they can live without WLAN. Plus, the 6760 slide styling seems to be trying to find middle ground between the too executive Eseries and too juvenile XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We called it ultra compact too and we mean it. It's hard to believe the 6760 slide is a Symbian smartphone to begin with. A formidable PocketPC like the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO makes it look almost toy-like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you find yourself interested in the new kid on the block, go ahead and take our guided tour of the Nokia 6760 slide. Symbian has little to no surprises perhaps but let's see how this little messenger handles and what it can do for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 6760 slide is quite modest. It only offers a charger, short USB cable and wired headphones with a remote/mic. The only bonus feature is the 2 GB microSD card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6760 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide is among the most compact QWERTY sliders we've seen and size will be quite an advantage in the eyes of some users. The weight of 123 grams is also friendly enough but the good hand balance is perhaps the more important thing to note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing to say about the 6760 slide is that despite the handset's compact dimensions, the keyboard itself is extremely comfortable. The 4-row layout has accommodated amazingly large and well-defined keys. The two Shift keys on each side of a huge Space bar are quite convenient, while two large buttons allow you to toggle Num Lock and Sym lock comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sliding mechanism, however, is very poorly done on the Nokia 6760 slide and makes a clattering sound. The cheap looking plastic up front is the other aspect that we are less than delighted with. The soft rubbery finish of the rear is a lot better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall handling of 6760 slide is very good though and the Shortcut buttons (Internet and Messaging) on the slider are quite comfortable in both landscape and portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide has a relatively small 2.4" 16M TFT display for its dimensions and it doesn't take full advantage of the available space at the front of the handset. We're not impressed with the QVGA resolution either - but in the end, it's what you get in the top-of-the-line Eseries too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has great sunlight legibility and its backlighting is very good - the same goes for the keyboard by the way. Both indoor and outdoor performance is excellent. An ambient light sensor integrated in the earpiece makes sure the display and keypad backlighting turn on when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call and end keys and the two soft keys share a slightly raised deck up front, the D-pad placed dead center. The front of the handset looks quite neat but we guess separate buttons could've been better in terms of press feedback and tactility. The D-pad feels a bit too stiff and produces loud clicks when scrolling up and down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side the display are the three additional hardware shortcuts: browser, menu and messaging keys. They were obviously styled with landscape use in mind but are reasonably comfortable in portrait mode too. Their usability is undisputable but the actual finish is a disappointing. They do look cheap and poorly backlit and their finish will perhaps be the first to wear off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing is their functionality cannot be changed - they don't have the dual press / press-and-hold action of the Eseries either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The asymmetrical frame around the display takes a slight inward bend to create a small groove - perfect for a thumb rest when sliding up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide-out QWERTY hardware keyboard is among the best we've tried. The centrally placed yellow marked numpad will be frequently used, as there's no front alphanumeric pad on the 6760 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you're surfing the net or typing a message you will need to press the yellow Num lock to activate numeric mode. On the homescreen you can directly enter digits and dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset sports the volume rocker and the shutter key. While the dedicated camera key is very responsive with soft feedback, the volume rocker is uncomfortably placed towards the bottom of the right side. The memory card slot is under the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dead center on the left side is the microUSB slot covered with a plastic lid. Mass storage mode is supported by the 6760 slide doesn't charge off USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone you'll find the battery cover latch and a tiny mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the other sides, the top one seems a little crowded. The 2.5mm jack, loudspeaker grill and the sealed charger port are placed there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plain backside of the handset has a nice and soft rubbery finish and features only a 3 megapixel camera lens with no other elements apart from the obligatory logos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the capable 1500 mAh BP-4L Li-Ion battery that powers the N97, among other Nokia handsets. It's said to provide up to 500 hours of stand-by and 5 hours of talk-time in a 2G network or 500 hours of stand-by and 4 hours of talk time on 3G. Based on our experience, a single charge will keep the phone going for as long as four days of moderate use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice and compact Nokia 6760 slide has a very friendly feel and near perfect QWERTY keyboard. It's a shame that part of the impression is ruined by the wobbly slider and the altogether cheap finish. The lack of a numpad could be a problem at times when you need to quickly dial a number. That said, Smart Dial is even more badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, compromises are to be expected in the price range of the 6760 slide. Maybe some of the disadvantages will be offset against the compact size, excellent keyboard and friendly handling. We can't help but note though we've seen many low and midrange S40 handsets that were better built than the 6760 slide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Latest Symbian S60 3rd<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide runs on Symbian 9.3 OS with the Series60 3rd Edition user interface. It has Feature Pack 2 like most of the E-Series phones such as the E52, E75 or the recently released E72.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6760 slide comes with the new S60 icons for a pinch of 5th edition (touch) styling. The interface can freely rotate to landscape mode thanks to the accelerometer, which also offers silencing calls and snoozing the alarm by flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto-rotate smoothly kicks in as you slide the QWERTY keyboard in and out too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby mode goes without saying on the Nokia 6760 slide. This is a convenient way to add shortcuts to all your favorite applications on the homescreen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can bring different kinds of notifications on the homescreen: from email boxes and voice mail, through calendar and to-dos to the currently running track in the Music player and FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide built-in memory is 128MB, which is a decent amount. The included 2GB microSD memory card comes in very handy for extending it, and higher capacity cards up to 16GB are supported too (as we confirmed ourselves).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing applications or any other files on the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice any difference compared to accessing data in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system which works fine. It's fully speaker-independent and recognizes a very high percentage of the user commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's a nice security feature known as Remote Lock. If your Nokia 6760 slide gets stolen or lost, you simply send a coded predefined SMS message to remotely lock the phone. After three unsuccessful attempts to unlock it, it wipes itself clean of all personal or sensitive info. You might not get your 6760 slide back, but at least nobody will get your personal data either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of the Nokia 6760 slide. Reception levels are good and there was no interference whatsoever. Sadly, there is no Smart dialing feature on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the built-in voice recognition system is doing quite a good job recognizing most of the commands. It is also fully speaker independent and doesn't require prerecording of the commands. Bear in mind though that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a name, voice dialing only dials the default one with no option to change that as you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results from our loudspeaker test. The Nokia 6760 slide has a very good loudspeaker and well balanced voice reproduction but scores a Good mark on our test. No worries - it is as good as it gets for a non-multimedia phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit this link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian phonebook with Windows Live integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian devices have phonebooks that can basically do anything you can think of with your contacts. Storage space can potentially extend to the whole phone memory, which is hardly possible to deplete. The Nokia 6760 slide can do much more than this though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it offers Windows Live integration in contacts in a separate tab located next to the OVI tab. Logging on with the Windows Live ID gives you direct access to Messenger, Hotmail, Spaces, Search and msn.com which is a great step towards full integration with Windows live services. Of course, OVI integration is fully supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. Given the Windows Live integration, a Hotmail inbox is predefined in the messaging submenu. The 6760 slide supports Nokia push Messaging as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages share the all too familiar intuitive editor. It has a counter of characters left up to a limit of 160. An indicator in brackets shows the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching from SMS to MMS is as simple as inserting some multimedia content. The phone prompts you to scale down photos that are too large for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports pop up on the standby screen and are then saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. The best part is that the Nokia 6760 slide is yet another handset that sports the ultra easy email setup we came to know and love in recent Nokia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service (be it POP or IMAP) is ready to run on the 6760 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments and signatures and generally the Nokia 6760 slide can meet most email needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated Nokia Messaging email client has better looks and functionality than the ones in the past. Each of the folders of your mailbox can now be sorted by whatever filters you might like and can then be searched through if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set what the folders preview should look like, i.e. how many lines should be given to each entry, whether title dividers should be applied etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player: Symbian regular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Full-featured music capabilities are not supposed to make or break for a messaging phone but the music player of the Nokia 6760 slide is still pretty decent despite the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated music keys, D-pad control over the music player the only option. There are a huge number of audio formats supported including eAAC+, MP3, WAV and WMA9. M3U playlists are also managed seamlessly and transferred files are added to the music library trouble-free by choosing the refresh option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filtering tracks by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets, bass booster and stereo widening effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide naturally also includes support for the A2DP Bluetooth profile, which allows listening to music on a Bluetooth stereo headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Regular video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 features Real player for playing your video clips. The video player works in portrait or fullscreen landscape mode and rotates automatically thanks to the accelerometer sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft key functions are hidden so they don't get in the way, and they only pop up when a key is pressed. Of course it's up to you to set the default view option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP4 video clips support is fine but you will probably resort to another player. The reason for this is quite simple - the 6760 slide lacks DivX and XviD support out of the box. Luckily, finding applications for the S60 3.2 that support those codecs is a fairly easy task (though you might have to pay for them).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well balanced audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide is on the better side of handsets we have tested as far as audio quality is concerned. It didn't break any records but the well balanced output is enough to earn it a good mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are average at best but the frequency response and the distortions are excellent. It's a bit different performance than the one its business cousin the E75 delivered but again it should be good enough for most of the users out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6760 slide vs Nokia E75 frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide sports stereo FM radio with RDS, controlled by the well known radio app. Upon starting, the app asks about your location in order to set up the proper frequencies for your area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. Scanning for alternative frequencies when traveling can also be set to automatic. You can save up to 50 radio stations and the option to play through the loudspeaker is available. There's no broadcast recording though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 MP camera fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Obviously the camera is not a priority on the Nokia 6760 slide. The 3MP fixed focus lens itself is quite unnoticeably located in the left upper corner with no LED flash or even self portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is also very basic with few options and settings available to the user. The sequence mode, self-timer, adjusting the white balance and color tone pretty much sum up the features at hand. Even the toolbar consists of only four black and white icons. There's not even geotagging despite the fact that there is an embedded GPS chip on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the 6760 slide is decent. Contrast is good, though the dynamic range is not the best out there. Also colors are somewhat dull. Noise levels are low but you can see oversharpening on almost every photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 6760 slide. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording doesn't improve our impressions of the camera on the 6760 slide, managing only QVGA videos at 15 fps. The actual quality of the recorded video is not very good either - though there's a fair bit of detail captured, it is periodically smeared by heavy compression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is very modest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Nokia 6760 slide is quite modest. It offers few options and is not intended for intensive image handling. Otherwise, no changes are to be seen here in terms of features - pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and zoomed in up to 2x. The gallery's functionality is basically copied by the file manager when you access your pictures from there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: fast data but no WiFi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 6760 slide spec sheet lacks important connectivity features such as Wi-Fi and a 3.5mm audio jack. If you can live without these two, you'll find the rest of the features reasonable - Bluetooth and USB v2.0, 2.5mm audio jack, quad-band GSM/EDGE and dual-band HSDPA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide comes complete with an elaborate browser to make use of the connectivity set and a dedicated hardware key on the front panel. The browser has excellent page rendering and works in both portrait and landscape mode and switches automatically thanks to the accelerometer sensor. The zoom level is easily controlled and the font size can be modified to fit as much content as possible on a single page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help find your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones can hardly be accused of lacking time-management skills. Even if you do happen to miss an application you need on your Nokia 6760 slide, there is plenty of third party software out there. However for most everyday uses it's unlikely you'll need anything more than the package you get straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has the typical three different view modes - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel, PDF and PowerPoint files seamlessly. Editing documents is not supported though by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the complete application from the Nokia Download center for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other office application is a ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated Search application works great. It can search almost the entire phone, or in separate sections as music, applications, messages, emails, landmarks etc. It can also search online using Google.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi here, Ovi there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typically for the latest Nokia devices the 6760 slide has tight Ovi integration with the Ovi contacts preinstalled on the phone. You may share with your friends all type of media via Ovi Share and see all the stuff your buddies have published.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff. In addition you can even share your GPS location so your friends can view immediately where you are at that particular moment using the Ovi Maps (something along the lines of Google's Latitude service).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to. What else can we say - it all works exactly as advertized. Your contacts need not have an Ovi-connected phone, they can chat with you just fine over Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6760 slide comes with two full-featured games - the Asphalt4 and Marble games. They both are well known titles that Nokia put on most of their handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps and GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6760 slide has a built-in GPS receiver and Ovi Maps preinstalled. The application on our Nokia is the latest 3.01 version. It took under a minute to get a satellite lock with A-GPS on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however always need an internet connection and cannot be preloaded on the phone in advance like you can do with the regular map data and the desktop Map loader application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3D view is also available in addition to the regular 2D mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though the Nokia 6760 slide does not feature a digital compass, it has an option to align map to route so you can always see the route as it naturally progresses or to align the map north.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The dashboard is as usually onboard and displays speed, pace, altitude and geoposition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional features like traffic information and city guides can also be activated but they come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in case you are still unhappy with Ovi Maps you can go for a third-party application and there are quite a lot of those available. GPS-wise, the not-so-big screen on the Nokia 6760 slide can hardly be considered a treat for full-featured in-car satnav use. Still, it can fill in when you need an occasional location service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The separate GPS data app displays all the information concerning the current route from A to B points.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A friendly and compact messenger like the Nokia 6760 slide undoubtedly has its own place in the Nokia portfolio. It is far from perfect though and the brand definitely has better options for those who need superior hardware and additional functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of Wi-Fi support can be compensated by a solid data plan but the small display and questionable build quality may be too much of a compromise. The solid messaging and excellent QWERTY keyboard give the 6760 slide enough focus and motivation. But it certainly risks being eclipsed by some of its own Symbian siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be insane to put the 6760 slide in the same league as the E75 but the 5730 XpressMusic looks by far the more logical choice in terms of sheer value for money. With nearly the same price tag, it brings extra features such as a 3.5 mm audio jack, dedicated music keys, Wi-Fi, and camera with Carl Zeiss optics, autofocus and LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5730 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6760 slide is not the usual Nokia phone though. It may as well be that its future was decided far away from home. It's a reasonable assumption that both Nokia and AT&amp;T are happy with how the Surge performed overseas. So, Nokia decided to build on that by releasing a basic Symbian messenger that might be popular with European carriers. Not least, there's a niche on the market that seems too small for the S60 top brass but still worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is one possible rival of the 6760 slide that's yet to be released on the market. It only fails to offer a smartphone platform but has a larger 2.8" touchscreen display, 3.5 mm audio jack, Wi-Fi, faster HSDPA and native DivX video support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 is another full-touch QWERTY messenger to hope for solid carrier-subsidized sales. Just like the 6760 slide it's got 3G but no Wi-Fi and is focused on social networking. The GW520 bets on touchscreen against the Symbian skill of the Nokia 6760 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GW520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the 6760 slide won't get away with the lack of certain features as a stand-alone offer but can hope to find some level of popularity if carriers embrace it (and go for some heavy subsidizing).</paragraph>
