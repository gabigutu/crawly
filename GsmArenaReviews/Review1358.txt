			<paragraph>HTC is holding a special press conference in London today. The company presents the HTC Sensation, which previously leaked as the HTC Pyramid. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see a GSM version of the EVO 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is the phone that today's event revolves around. It's a truly capable smartphone, you can even see how it stacks up next to the Samsung Galaxy S II here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation uses the latest Snapdragon platform with a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor and the Adreno 220 GPU and packs a 4.3-inch S-LCD touchscreen with qHD resolution. It has an 8 megapixel camera capable of capturing 1080p@30fps videos. The camera comes with a new Instant Capture feature and stereo sound recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's UI has been revamped to Sense 3.0 ? you can see some of the new looks and animations in the video above. The Sensation also features the new HTC Watch on-demand video service, where you can rent or buy movies straight from your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation will become available exclusively from Vodafone in its key European markets this May, while the rest of the carriers and retailers will get it in mid-June.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation 4G is the US bound variety of the Euro version and will be available exclusively to T-Mobile USA starting this summer. The vague launch date could even mean Q3 2011.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another piece of news we took from the event was that the HTC Flyer tablet will launch on 9 May all over Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That was all. There will be no other announcements, which means the international EVO 3D will stay in rumorland for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hit the next page for our first impressions from the HTC Sensation.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>What sets the HTC Sensation apart is the powerful dual-core platform, the big high-res S-LCD screen, the 8 MP camera with Full HD video recording and the updated HTC Sense interface. The phone also packs an MHL-enabled micro-USB port (MHL standing for mobile high-definition video link). What that means is you can use the port for either USB or HDMI connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the real world the HTC Sensation feels remarkably light - it feels as light (if not slightly lighter than) the regular HTC Desire. It's got some nice clean shapes and the back is a mixture of smooth plastic and aluminum which could slip out of your grip if you're not careful. The design reminds us a lot of the Desire S and most importantly of all, it's got a curved display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yep, the display is curved but it's not readily noticeable. You can hardly tell from first look however according to HTC, the curved screen should allow your finger to easily feel when it's nearing the edge of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's interesting is that the Sensation's LCD itself isn't actually curved but rather the Gorilla glass on top is curved - like on the Nexus S really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, unlike the Nexus S - it's only the outer edge that's curved inward, the majority of the glass just looks and feels flat. You can hopefully see it below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation comes with the updated HTC Sense 3 UI which similarly features on the already available Sprint-only HTC EVO 3D. It adds a lot of new functionality to the lock screen including an application quick-launcher and also allows you to get live status, stock or weather updates without unlocking the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the HTC Sensation in action:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Meetup event<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also attended the HTC Meetup - the consumer event held by HTC to get fans together to showcase their latest dual-core Sensation. Best of all, everyone was invited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides mingling with the present HTC fans we also used the opportunity to spend some more quality time with the HTC Sensation. We even ran the Quadrant benchmark on it but the poor thing obviously was not up to the task (probably due to the pre-release software which still referred to the device as 'Pyramid'). We'll obviously have to wait for the Sensation to hit retail status to get a meaningful and comparable result that truly reflects its performance. And it is a snappy bugger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As previously mentioned along with the HTC Sensation, HTC also announced their new HTC Watch service. It's essentially an on-demand video service for renting or buying films to watch on your HTC device. It comes complete with a full video marketplace where you can browse items, watch trailers, queue downloads and of course watch movies via an interface that's fast to use and good to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the HTC Gallery app. Looks a little more like stock Android, funnily enough; at least when browsing whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greatest novelty of HTC Sense 3 is the active lockscreen that can show real-time information regarding weather, stocks, friends and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the HTC Sense homescreen and it's Weather and Friends Stream apps are not that different from before.</paragraph>
