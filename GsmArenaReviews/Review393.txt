			<paragraph>The Nokia N93 has been on the market for some time now and it did arouse a lot of commotion when it was first officially announced. The extraordinary Carl-Zeiss optical zoom combined with a Vario-Tessar lens was enough to rocket the anticipation of Nokia fans to the skies. This combined with video capturing in VGA resolution at a high framerate is an outstanding achievement that not before long was something reserved for the digital camcorders realm. Now the time has come to see for ourselves how good in reality the ground-breaking Nokia N93 is.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is supposed to be delivered in a package along with a Nokia stereo headset HS-23, a Nokia USB cable CA-53, a Nokia TV-out cable CA-64U, a wrist strap, a pouch, and a 128 MB miniSD memory card. All this is market dependent of course, so take that information with a grain of salt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dubbed as multimedia computer, the Nokia N93 was highly awaited by our team since the specs sounded more than promising. The eagerness to try it first hand built up as time went on and the first sample pictures and videos captured with the phone started to pop up here and there. The mobile is supposed to be one of the top multimedia phones on the market and it was even voted European media phone of the Year 2006-2007. You can understand our impatience to test it and since you are reading this review, you probably share it, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N93 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it turned out that the striving for making it the utmost multimedia machine has turned the Nokia N93 into the utmost uncomfortable mobile phone to use in your everyday life. The sheer size of the thing makes it a portable device that most probably would end up lying on the shelf besides your digital camera just begging to be taken out on those weekends out of town. What we are trying to say is that the multimedia part of the device has evolved so much that now it's no more comfortable to carry it with you and take the occasional snapshot from time to time - while this was the original idea when incorporating digital cameras into mobile phones. Nokia has just crossed the line and went too far this time - venturing into an entirely different product category. But when you take a not-so-good digital camcorder, combine it with a not-so-smart smartphone, add up a size that would easily make you start thinking of carrying a bag, and finally put a price tag exceeding that of the latest PocketPCs and smartphones on the market, then? you are in for a highly dissatisfying product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 is available in two colors - silver and black. Our phone we got to test was the black one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Taking a closer look?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Right in the center of the outer panel of the flip you can see the small secondary display. Below it is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N93</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom rim of the flip you can see the Infrared port which blends nicely with the phone's design and is barely noticeable for an inexperienced eye as well as a rather large eyelet used for the wrist strip supplied with the retail package. We cannot imagine that someone might hang that monster of a mobile on their necks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Bottom side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper part of the handset's body is taken by the zoom lens. Unlike Nokia N90, the lens cannot be rotated. There is a plastic protective cap, which you might lose soon if you don't use the supplied string. The swivel joint for the upper part of the clamshell is positioned on the right side of the lens tube. Besides the camera lens and the LED flash, the left side of the handset incorporates the miniSD card slot and the Pop-port for data cable connection and TV-out functionality. Both are hidden underneath protective rubber caps. Right next to the Pop port is the standard Nokia charging port, the tiny one. The miniSD card slot has hot-swap functionality but it's recommended that you exit all running applications before taking the card out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Left side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the phone is rather bare in fact and incorporates only the On/Off key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Top of the phone ? on/off key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the clamshell is more interesting as it houses the zoom lever. Inside it is a button marked with a red dot. It is used as a shutter key. Below it is a key that is a full copy of the navigation D-pad on the numeric keypad. It's very convenient to use it with the screen rotated in camera mode. In fact, when you rotate the upper part of the clamshell that way the camera application gets automatically started and the main navigation D-pad gets disabled so you can navigate through the available options only with the side D-pad. Below the side D-pad there is a key used for changing between still camera and video camera modes when you are using the handset as a camera. In any other case a longer press on that key locks the keypad. Below that key there is yet another key that is used to turn on/off the flash. It works even with the clamshell closed, this way allowing you to use the LED as a flashlight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Delving even further?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Opening the clamshell reveals the large, and rather comfortable, we must add, keypad. Besides the navigation keys, there are the standard Nokia smartphone keys such as the Pencil key, the Menu key, the Multimedia key and the correction C-key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting object you may notice on the one of the close-ups is a small hole in the upper left corner of the keypad marked with "L". That is the left microphone used for recording the stereo sound in video clips. There is another, "R" or right microphone on the opposite back side of the phone. In fact Nokia N93 doesn't have any other microphones besides those two little fellows so the "L" microphone is the one used in calls. Keep this in mind when you hold the phone to your head.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Above the main display there is the secondary VGA camera used for video calls and a light sensor used for dynamic changing the brightness of the screen in accordance with the current light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The N93 main display has a pleasant blue tint when the backlighting is off</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mechanics revealed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The swivel joint of the upper part of the clamshell allows it to take several working positions. Besides the normal flip opened mode, there is an imaging mode and a view mode. The imaging mode is used for taking pictures or video. It's a shame that you cannot use the rotating flip in order to make self-portraits. Indeed you can turn the display in all directions but you can use the camera only in the imaging mode. The second additional mode is the view mode or as we like to call it - the notebook mode. A similar mode is seen in mobiles such as Samsung D550, Samsung D300 and the scrapped Motorola MPx. Although we have to say that the rivals' implementation is more convenient. Firstly, those three are equipped with a QWERTY keypad. And secondly, the Nokia design has two substantial flaws. On one hand, forgive us the pun, the camera lens in fact gets in your thumb's way when trying to operate the navigation D-pad in view mode and on the other hand, the upper row of keys - "3","6","9", and "#" are in fact almost unusable because the flip covers half of them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tightly knit construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia N93 is occupied by the large battery cover. It has an exceptional construction with several mounting points which allows for a greater stability. It seems possible that this cover won't become loose even after several years of use. Below it is the SIM card bed and the Nokia Li-Poly BP-6M battery with capacity of 1100mAh. Although we couldn't find any official information, it seems that the SIM card bed has hot-swap functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N93 back view ? battery cover opened ? SIM bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a very large phone, Nokia N93 seems quite solid at first sight. When you actually touch and feel the phone the first impression you might get is of the plastic material it is made of and that leaves a bad memory after all. However, N93 proved us wrong in the end as it turns out to be a device with rather good construction. Its twisting and opening parts worked great and made clear sounds whenever such were expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No problems occurred with its top clamshell part and it functioned perfectly. The spinning display seemed well put in place too and there is not risk in suddenly falling down broken. Speaking in general, the construction of N93 may have been slightly better, mostly due to its plastic covers, but the phone is in no way as bad as the N90 model. In fact, it is much better made.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Power-hungry as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery is supposed to provide the smartphone with up to 3.7 hrs of talk time in WCDMA networks and up to 5.1 hrs of talk time in GSM networks. The expected stand-by time is up to 10 days. Since we had the chance to do a dedicated battery test it turned out that the handset lasted 58 hours when using it in a rather extensive way as follows:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having those figures in mind it seems that the smartphone is rather power hungry when put though its paces since even a large capacity battery like the BP-6M wouldn't keep it going for more than 60 hours. Anyway, when left on stand-by for the same time - 60 hours, the phone lost just one of the six battery indicator levels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The little thing on top<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The external display of N93 is an 1.1" one with 128 x 36 pixels resolution and 65K colors. It indicates the battery status and the signal reception bar as well as icons for missed calls and received messages. This small display has another extra line which is for the caller's name or number. It also serves surprisingly well as a music player indicator. Legibility in direct sunlight is not a problem once you've found the right looking perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The external display</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And the large one inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main display of the phone is a 2.4" in diagonal which makes it on of the biggest on the market. Nokia have decided to put a QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution in this model instead of the 352 x 416 pixels resolution from N90. The phone's display is capable of displaying 262K colors and has a great sunlight protection glass. It also offers a very wide vieweing angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N93 main display ? Nokia E50 and N93 display size comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors and images on N93 are vivid and clear and Nokia deserves compliments for the great job with this model's display. Pictures taken with the camera are viewed perfectly. The backlighting is also great and has no faults. Only when you browse the web you will notice the difference compared to the highest resolution displays of Nokia N90 and E70.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It does make calls, you know?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 signal reception is just what you would expect from a high-end smartphone - flawless. The loudspeaker of the phone is also good but is not the loudest we've seen. Ringtone volume, however, is sufficient enough and is audible even in crowded places. The vibration of the phone is also strong enough. The phone has brilliant speaker quality and the sound during conversations is very clear and without any interferences.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>But it doesn't end with that..<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 user interface is identical to the interface used in all other current Symbian smartphone. That is why we are going to use several paragraphs from other reviews.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 runs on Series 60 user interface of third generation. The Symbian operating system works very well on the phone and is quite fast. The only exception is the starting of the camera application, which takes a couple of seconds to load. Generally, there is a nice performance increase in comparison to the previous 2nd generation S60 user interface. We are quite pleased with the response of the operating system and would recommend it sincerely if it wasn't the incompatibility with the applications written for the previous versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, there aren't that many applications written for this version of Symbian and that seems to be a problem for the owners of any phone with that OS. We expect that this shortage of 3rd party software would be remedied by the end of the year. More and more applications come up every day since all new Nokia phones come with the new version of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active display contains information about the network coverage, the battery status, date, time, operator name. If you change the graphic theme you may find different clocks to appear on the active display. There is also the stand-by display row which shows 6 applications you can set and the calendar's today's tasks and events. The next lines can be filled with information about missed calls, received messages or e-mails, or the song you're currently playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an Offline mode which works as an Airplane mode, switching off the phone functionality of Nokia N93 but allowing the user to use the other capabilities of the device. The Offline mode can also be used if you don't insert a SIM card in the phone. While in offline mode the phone can still provide WLAN and Bluetooth connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Active stand-by display while phone is in Offline mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's main menu can be viewed either in matrix grid of 4 x 3 icons or in list view. If you choose the list view you will be able to see 5 items at a time. Most of the submenus also allow changing the type of view. The same options are available when viewing the menu in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main Menu icon view ? Main Menu list view ? Main Menu landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Multimedia button brings up on the display a picture of the four ways of the navigation button and the appropriate applications assigned to the four directions plus the confirmation center button. The assigned applications are customizable, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Multimedia menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 has 50 MB internal memory and a miniSD memory card slot . The phone will come with 128 MB card enclosed in the package. Nokia's choice of the miniSD card type is very good for the users as those cards are cheap and reach up to 2 GB capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great feature of N93 is the voice recognition system which can be used both for dialing contacts and starting applications. It doesn't need to have your commands pre-recorded, in fact it handles most of the voice commands you give it. The shortcut for starting the voice application is long press of the right soft key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Voice recognition menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several preinstalled themes on the phone but they don't seem to make significant changes to the user interface. They change the wallpaper and the color scheme only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some of the available themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 has six default ringing profiles (including the Offline mode). The user can create custom profiles as easily as can modify the existing ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Available profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an interesting option in the settings menu called Reject Call with SMS. It means that after you reject a call, the phone automatically sends a SMS to the caller, explaining why you have rejected his call. This option can be very useful, indeed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Yes, you've seen it already<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia N93 looks just like a normal Nokia Symbian phonebook. It has no limit of the contacts as it uses the phone's free memory and thus can hold an enormous amount of entries. They can be ordered either by first or last name and can be searched by letter-by-letter typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Phonebook info</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New contacts can be assigned more than 30 different fields and numbers. Naturally, you can assign ringtones and pictures to contacts of your choice, but we couldn't find an option to assign a personal video clip. Synchronization with PC works seamlessly, too. You can actually rename the predefined fields of the phonebook and thus customize them to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Various fields ? Renaming a label</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log of Nokia N93 contains three tabs for Dialed, Received and Missed calls. Every tab can hold up to 10 call records with their date and time. However, if you enter the Log application in the My Own submenu, you will find yourself in a list of all call records and data transfers and sessions which have taken place in the last 30 days. This includes even the WLAN connections.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key taps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing messages works like a charm. Being so large, the keypad is very easy to use even for first-timers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor displays a counter of the characters left of the 160 limit. It also displays in brackets the number of separate messages the message will be divided into. The display allows 6 lines to be shown en bloc. Delivery reports appear on the screen when the keypad is not locked. After that, they are stored in a separate folder in the Messaging sub-menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? Writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor is very intuitive and easy to use. Multiple email accounts are supported. N93 works with POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. The email client can download either the headers only or the full messages. Attachments are supported as well. This email client manages most user needs regarding email communication but does not take full advantage of the great display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Players all around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music Player of the N93 is very good. It has an equalizer, supports Playlists and the phone's loud speaker is very good and loud. The supported file formats are MP3, AAC, m4a, eAAC+ and WMA. Of course, the player can run in the background. When the clamshell is closed, the Music Player can be controlled with the help of the external display and the side D-Pad. The controls of the player are very intuitive. It also manages M3U playlist format seamlessly and can even handle the file automatically if it is placed in the same directory as the music files. A good advice to the users is to use USB 2.0 card readers for transferring music files to the memory card as this way is much faster than the Nokia Pop-port transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N93 music player ? Options ? Equalizer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has a Real Player and a Flash player preinstalled. The FM radio application is very good and the only problem is that it lacks RDS. You can preset and save your favorite stations or you can switch them manually. Nokia N93 radio application is Visual Radio, which means that it can download information from the radio stations about the current song and artist. There aren't many radio stations that support that service, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Picture &amp; Video gallery is a great one and offers very fast response. You can view the pictures and videos both in portrait and landscape framed mode as well as in full screen mode with no visible borders at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Gallery ? Image &amp; Video gallery in portrait and landscape mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick a picture you can zoom it in up to 4 times and view it in detail. The actual zooming is generally fast as is the overall multimedia performance of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zooming in on a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the gallery has nice file-manager functionality, meaning that you can select and send multiple files. Besides that the smartphone has the usual file manager that doeas its job pretty satisfactory when it comes to filtering files according to the memory used, marking, moving, copying and managing applications. As for application management there is also a separate Application manager.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>And here at last?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera seems to be among the most interesting things about Nokia N93. The 3.2 megapixel matrix along with autofocus and 3x optical zoom with Carl-Zeiss optics has made many people curious about the capabilities of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N80 3 megapixel camera ? view-finder ? taking pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just to sum up for the most impatient - we are not so pleased with its performance. Read further on for more details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the view finder application is very easy to use. It can only operate in landscape mode. The camera supports self-timer pictures, sequence of pictures, different shooting modes (+night mode), white balance, exposure value, different color effects (sepia, black &amp; white, etc.), sharpness, brightness, contrast, color saturation, flicker cancellation. Nokia has chosen to use "scenes", called "shooting mode". You can select scenes like Portrait, Landscape, Sport or Night Portrait and the camera will hopefully adjust to the situation. There is a possibility to define your own scene setting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2.7333x optical zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fitting a zoom lens in a mobile phone is an achievement, no doubt about that. Everyone with digital camera experience knows how much more fun is a camera with zoom. The digital zoom most of the camera phones are equipped with just doesn't count - using it with full resolution still images makes no sense, you just fill your phone's memory with useless interpolated data. On the contrary, the optical zoom lens reveals more details when zooming on the target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While making the zoom test we were surprised to find that the Carl Zeiss 3x labeled lens is actually not exactly 3x. The EXIF data shows that in wide position the focal length in wide position is 4.5mm and in full tele it is 12.3mm. This makes the zoom something like 2.7333x. If however we choose to believe the label on the front of the lens, which states focal range of 4.5-12.4mm than the zoom is 2.7555x. We also measured the zoom by comparing the size of the objects taken in wide and tele position, which confirmed that the zoom range is less than 3x. Comparing the Nokia N93 lens range to a digital camera with known 35mm equivalent focal length revealed that the phone has a 35mm equivalent focal length of about 35-97mm, quite typical for an entry level digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To test the quality of the lens we made two types of photo sample series. The first one is making a series of photos from one and the same position, this way showing how much more detail the tele position of the lens reveals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    100% crops wide ? mid-zoom ? tele ? simulated digital zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From this test you can see how much more detail the zoom lens resolves. The sharpness of the lens is very good for such a small physical size. You can also see the results of the optical and the digital zoom, of course, there is no comparison. (The simulated digital zoom is produced by resizing the wide sample in an image editing program, a method guaranteed to give better results than the in-camera real time processing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>               More zoom samples in full resolution wide ? mid-zoom ? tele</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other type of samples are taken from different position and with different lens focal lengths, but framing the object the same way. These tests will show the quality of the lens in tele position - how much details you lose by using the zoom instead of getting closer to the subject. We expected a significant difference in the quality of the wide and tele position for a lens this small, even a Carl-Zeiss branded one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   100% crops wide ? mid-zoom ? tele</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, not surprisingly the best quality is achieved at the wide end, but the results at tele are not that bad. The conclusion here is that if you can, it's better to use your feet instead of the zoom lever - you will get higher quality photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       More zoom samples in full resolution (explanation in the text) wide ? mid-zoom ? tele</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Noisy environment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have expected that the more expensive Nokia N93 model would produce higher quality photos than those by the N73 model in all circumstances, than you are wrong. The reason is the zoom lens. The zoom lens in general requires smaller physical size of the image sensor. The smaller size leads to more cramped pixels, which results in higher noise levels. The processing Nokia uses doesn't help at all, in fact it seems that the sharpening routines even exaggerate the noise. Indeed, you can see that noise is high in almost every picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The noise levels are too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise is not that much of an issue if you are going to use your photos in lower resolution, for web publishing for example. The downsampling is known to mask the noise. The samples in 1024 x 768 pixels resolution look very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N93 photos downsampled to 1024 x 768 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indoor, where the light is weaker, the noise increases, but not as much as we've seen is some other camera mobiles. The indoor photos taken by Nokia N93 are altogether usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Indoor samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the light is really weak, you can rely on the build-in LED flash. The problem is that the LED is effective only within close range (less than 1m) and only in wide zoom position. We didn't managed to make even one usable photo in tele position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Using the build-in LED flash</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Macro mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 is able to take good macro photos without switching to the dedicated close-up mode. In fact the dedicated mode is not very usable, because it switches the auto-focus off. The best macro coverage is achieved at the tele end of the zoom, quite convenient, because there is not need to get really close to the objects, which sometimes blocks the light on the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Macro samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 produces quite realistic and pleasant colors. The only problem we have noticed is with the flowers from the macro samples - the orange colors in reality looked different. The auto white balance system also works reliably; we didn't notice any significant problems. The auto-focus system, while not very fast, is reliable, we had just a few out of focus pictures during the testing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the highly advertised features of the N93 was the DVD-like quality video recording meaning that it shoots in a resolution of 640x480 pixels at the whopping 30 frames per second. Interesting additions to the video recording functionality are the two microphones on both sides of the body used to produce stereo audio for those precious videos. Nokia N93 has various settings to make the most of the video application to suit the user's taste perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Some video settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows the users to zoom while recording. The sound from the zooming mechanism is also captured in the record although the phone decreases the sensitivity of the microphones while zooming and this way masks it a bit. If you don't want this sound in your movies, you have the option to disable the optical zoom during filming and rely on the digital zoom only. Anyway, don't expect the Nokia N93 captured videos to look as smooth as a DVD movie or minDV camcorder footage. What you can expect though is a better video quality than any other phone on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video samples VGA 30 fps, optical and digital zoom 6.5 MB ? 7.3 MB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video samples VGA 30 fps digital zoom only 5.1 MB ? no zoom 3.4 MB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 uses the free memory and thus has no limit (apart from the memory card free space) for the video records duration. To be able to record longer, you can switch to lower resolution - QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) or reduce the frames to 15 per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video sample QVGA 30 fps 0.9 MB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indoors, with limited amount of light, Nokia N93 shows surprisingly good results. The movies don't lose much quality due to the lack of light. In complete darkness, however, the situation changes. If you have hoped the LED will be able to emit enough light for the movies, well, you may be disappointed. Even from as close as 40 cm from the subject, the video camera can be used only in wide lens position and even then the quality is terrible. If you want to use the optical zoom (look at the sample) than you are out of luck, the camera records completely black scenes. Switching to night mode doesn't help either, it just adds some green tint to the black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  VGA 30 fps indoors 3.8 MB ? QVGA 30 fps using LED 0.5 MB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera has image stabilizer function. We must admit that we expected a bit more from it. We made several tests under different conditions and we didn't managed to see any significant difference when switching the stabilizer on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  QVGA 30 fps Stabilizer off 1MB ? stabilizer on 0.8 MB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, we must repeat that Nokia N93 has excellent video recording capabilities for a phone. Currently, it has no rivals on the market. If we seem a little harsh on the phone, this is only because of the high "DVD-like" expectations.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Further on, the smartphone has a TV-out feature which allows it to connect to any standard TV set with the TV-out cable included in the retail box. Once you connect it to the TV set, you can view your pictures and videos on the large screen. The TV-out functionality supports both PAL and NTSC and screen ratio 4:3 and 16:9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> TV-out options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TV-out functionality has a very nice implementation. The handset starts transferring the current screen image directly to the TV screen as soon as you connect it via the cable. The cable itself transfers video and stereo audio signal.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The TV image is exactly what appears on the phone's display both in portrait and landscape modes. When you view pictures or video through the Gallery application the TV set receives the multimedia files in a larger resolution than the one on the mobile screen. Thus you can view the VGA (640x480 pixels) resolution videos in their full glory. Unfortunately, that doesn't hold true for the office applications and the Web browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - full<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports GPRS, EDGE, Wi-Fi, UMTS, PTT, Bluetooth and Infrared. Nokia N93 works with Bluetooth Specification 2.0. Unfortunately, the A2DP profile is not among the supported profiles which makes impossible the use of stereo Bluetooth headset with the phone. But then again, there is only one Nokia handset currently available on the market that supports that profile - the Nokia 8800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is also supported with the USB cable supplied in the retail box. When connected to a PC, one of three modes can be chosen for the handset: "Mass storage" - memory card is available as a removable USB drive, no drivers are required; "PC Suite" - standard mode; "Picture Bridge" - direct access to printer, which supports PictBridge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast data transfer can be used via GPRS, EDGE or 3G UMTS. You can also try the Wi-Fi connectivity, in which case you have to be near a Wi-Fi hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the phone to detect and connect automatically to such hotspots or you can search them manually. When you are connected, N93 automatically creates an access point for the hotspot and starts using its Internet broadband. The connection speed depends on the distance from the hotspot and on the provider. The signal is displayed as the network signal strength.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  WLAN Options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the phone is UPnP (Universal Plug &amp; Play) enabled. The UPnP technology is the wireless alternative to the well known Plug &amp; Play standard that allows seamless connection between different devices. In the future the UPnP enabled devices which have some sort of wireless connectivity options such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth could easily communicate with other intelligent devices without the need of drivers or user configuration. Thus in several years you could be commanding you entire set of home appliances with the help of your smartphone or PDA only - and what's more - you could do that from your office.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing the web<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing with Nokia N93 is a sheer delight as is the case with all current Nokia smartphones. There are two separate web browser applications. One of them is much simpler and reminds us of the browser implemented in older models. The second one is entirely a different story. It makes even very sophisticated pages fit on the screen and displays web pages just like on PC. There is no doubt that the great display helps a lot for this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is even a mouse cursor which can be operated through the four-way navigation button. Surprisingly, it works great and is very easy to control. A semi-transparent mini-map of the page shows up on the screen when scrolling a webpage. The mini-map can also be accessed by a shortcut - the "8" key. You can zoom in and out on the page using the "?" and "#" buttons. It's amazing to see how small the text can be and still remain readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the sites we visited (including gsmarena.com, take a look at the screenshots) looked exactly like on the PC. Even when loading complex pages, the web browser was operating fast and there was no slowdown in the scrolling speed. The browser also loads Flash clips (not all of them, pitifully) and has no problems dealing with Java Scripts. All-in-all, it's an impressive job from Nokia. Generally, it's the best mobile browser we've seen.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The phone has various organizer applications and features. It features a dual clock. You can set two different times and dates in two time zones. The Calendar has Monthly, Weekly and Daily view. You can assign Meeting, Anniversary, Memo and To-do tasks in the Calendar. You can also put alarms on those assignments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calendar: monthly, weekly, and daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an Office icon in the main menu and it leads to a folder with Notes, Converter, Calculator, Recorder and Quickoffice. The Converter converts Currencies, Area, Energy, Length, Mass, Power, Pressure, Temperature, Time, Velocity and Volume. The calculator is very simple and easy to use. Regrettably, the Recorder has a one minute limit for voice records. This seems quite illogical since the phone has such powerful features, enough internal memory and a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Converter ? Calculator ? Recorder ? Sample note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quickoffice opens various office files such as ones created by MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint and Adobe Acrobat. They can be viewed seamlessly. Zooming, Scrolling, Resizing are supported as well. Regrettably, you cannot modify them in any way. There is also a Data Transfer application in the Tools submenu. It is used to transfer contacts and organizer items from one Nokia phone to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Word file ? Excel file ? PDF file</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the phone has an excellent Tutorial tool which describes in a very user-friendly way the main functions of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Available tutorials ? "DVD Creation" help file </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several applications preinstalled in the phone: Catalogs, Barcode reader, "Lifeblog", etc. "Catalogs" is a free application for downloading catalogs of paid content for your mobile such as tools, videos, ringtones, and games. The Barcode reader application is used to decode different types of codes (for example, barcodes and codes in magazines). The codes may contain information such as URL links, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers. The Nokia Lifeblog application is used for publishing to your blog directly from your phone. It works with most of the major blog service sites in the world. There are also some printing applications such as the Image print application for printing images from the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N93 also has Online sharing support. Using it you can share your images and videos in online albums, weblogs, or in other sharing services on the Web. You can upload content, save unfinished posts as drafts and continue later, and view the content of the albums. In order to connect your mobile directly to a service provider such as Flickr you must download a configuration file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Barcode reader, Nokia Lifeblog</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main issues of Nokia N93 is that the relatively new Symbian 9.1 OS is not compatible with applications written for older versions. Thus you would have difficulties finding additional software for this phone. We could only hope that by the end of the summer new 3rd party applications would begin to gradually emerge on the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Yet again, a snake pit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>N93 has two preinstalled games: Snakes and Card Deck. "Snakes" is a 3D version of the popular Snake game of the Nokia phones. It is quite enjoyable and we found it very amusing. Card Deck is a simple Java game that features a package of several card games like Klondike, Golf, etc... Of course, you can install additional games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cumbersome and expensive are two words that best describe the Nokia N93. There is no doubt that it is a smartphone with exceptional capabilities. But it would remain a product for the tech buffs only. The advances in digital camera technology are a great thing but in the end it seems that those cannot find their place in a device that you would use conveniently in your every-day life.</paragraph>
