			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bigger than the Note but not as bright. Not saying anything. We wouldn't want to get this guy upset. So, careful with the F-word. And no, not phablet, obviously. Though at 8mm, the Samsung Galaxy Mega technically isn't fat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There has been no such thing as size limit for Samsung but is the Galaxy Mega 6.3 already pushing it too far? The massive 6.3" screen puts the bigger one of the Mega brothers well into the upper range of phablets and almost into tablet territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 - as in a 6.3" screen - is the bigger and better half of the Mega pair, making an interesting alternative to the Galaxy Note line of phablets. It's bigger than the first two (most likely bigger than even the Note III as well) but actually more affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were of course some inevitable cuts, mainly in the display and chipset area, but the Mega 6.3 still boasts LTE connectivity, Android 4.2.2 with exclusive TouchWiz features like Multi-window and Air View among other goodies the Galaxy S4 has, including the IR remote control functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the screen is less than stellar, 233ppi is better than what the Galaxy Grand got and on par with the Galaxy S III mini. It's the chipset we're more worried about - it's a better version of the one Nokia uses in the Lumia 520. Sure, the CPU runs at a much higher clockspeed (70% higher) and there's three times the amount of RAM, but the Galaxy Mega 6.3 will have to really bring its A game to get anyone impressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the proprietary Multi-window feature really comes into its own here - the split screen gives each app nearly the same surface area (though not aspect ratio) as the display of a Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And you get premium goodies like the latest Android version available, Air View (detects your finger hovering above the screen and offers functionality similar to that of the S Pen), an IR remote control, LTE, Group Play and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recent smartphone history has seen plenty of too-big-to-use devices that were quick to prove doubters wrong. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 will raise a few eyebrows, but it has the potential to bring the phablet form factor to the masses, seeing how the Note II might be out of reach for some (which didn't stop it from selling by the millions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So how big is "big" anyway? The Mega 6.3 is ample for sure, but its dimensions aren't that scary - jump to the next page to find out how it feels in the hand and whether the screen is worth the extra bulk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 stands 167.6mm tall and 88mm wide. That's about 20% more surface area than the Note II (151.1 x 80.5mm), and you do get just over 30% more screen real estate. This means Samsung has managed to cover a bigger portion of the front of the device with the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Mega 6.3 is thinner (8mm vs. 9.4mm) and not much heavier (199g vs. 183g) than the Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 follows the Galaxy S4 design language to a tee, just like the Note 8.0. It is a sort of a facelift of the Galaxy S III design, less rounded with slimmer bezel and a characteristic LED flash positioning under the back camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing Samsung changed between the S III and S4 was the pattern of the plastic. We like the new one better, but the glossy hyperglazed plastic is still quite impractical - easily smudged and with poor grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the general styling spans devices with screens from 3.27" (Galaxy Young) to 8" (Galaxy Note 8.0) and frankly it's worn out and lacking in premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is bigger than most phones (including the Galaxy S4). It's so big it barely fits on the device - the bezels are very thin, especially on the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 screen offers just over 30% more real estate than the Note II and nearly 60% more than the 5" Galaxy S4. It makes very efficient use of the front surface, rivaled only by the S4 itself and the Sony Xperia ZL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can hold the phablet in one hand, though some will find it uncomfortable. The thin bezels offer no room to put your thumb and the slippery back doesn't help. Using the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 with one hand is only possible for a limited number of tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled a smaller keyboard in some places (the QWERTY keyboard, the dialer keyboard), which does improve usability a bit. However, the notification area is completely out of reach and the lower corners are tough too, both areas are very important to working with Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pocket the Mega 6.3 and since it's slim and fairly light it won't bulge in your pocket or feel like a brick.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display stretches 720p resolution on 6.3"<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the core of the Samsung Galaxy Mega .63 is the 6.3" screen. It's a massive TFT LCD of 720p resolution, which works out to 233ppi. While that's nowhere near the 441ppi of the Galaxy S4 or even the 306ppi of the S III, it's better than what the Galaxy Grand got and the same pixel density as the Galaxy S III mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to take into account that bigger screens are usually held further from the eyes, which partially makes up for the lower pixel density. If you're coming from a Galaxy S4 you'll immediately spot the lower sharpness, especially when looking at text, but other than that the screen image quality is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3's screen under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all this talk of pixel density, we have to mention the resolution and how it affects the interface. While the screen of the Mega 6.3 is much bigger than that of the Galaxy S4, it doesn't fit more shortcuts or other UI elements. Samsung could have drawn the elements smaller, but that would have affected the image quality as smaller text doesn't render as well on the relatively low pixel density (compared to the previous and current generation of flagships).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mega 6.3 screen has good viewing angles with no color shift and only slight contrast loss when looking at the display at an a angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness control in the notification area is quite handy and can be hidden to make room for more notifications. It also features an automatic brightness mode with a slider to tweak the algorithm, making the display generally darker or generally brighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 features a standard set of sensors on its front (proximity and ambient light), a 1.9MP camera and a status LED, all clustered around the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other side of the screen is the traditional arrangement of a hardware Home button and capacitive Menu and Back keys. Stock Android has moved away from this arrangement, but Samsung insist on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's extra functionality too: upon a double tap, the Home key launches S Voice, while a press and hold opens the task switcher. A long press of the Menu key launches Google Now, and a long press of the Back key toggles the Multi-window tray (the Multi-window feature needs to be active for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Volume rocker is placed on the left side of the Galaxy Mega 6.3, while the Power/Lock key is on the right. Both are positioned proportionally lower on the tall device, so they are at about the same height from the bottom as the ones on the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated camera shutter key, but the volume rocker can be set to act as a zoom lever, still or video camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Galaxy Mega 6.3 features a microUSB port with MHL functionality, so you can output HD video with the appropriate dongle. The mic pinhole is next to the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the device is the secondary mic (for noise cancellation and stereo audio capture), a standard 3.5mm audio jack and an IR emitter. The emitter is used for the remote control functionality, which is great but it makes a bad impression that it's just a hole on the top of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back of the device there's the 8MP camera lens, centrally placed at the top. It protrudes from the 8mm thick body and the device rests on it when placed on its back, which makes it unstable and means you should be careful not to put it on a surface that can scratch the lens glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the camera is the LED flash and at the bottom of the back is the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of the hyperglazed plastic that Samsung favors in recent years and can be opened. Below it is the 3,200mAh battery, which can be removed too. We expected a bit more capacity from the battery, it's barely bigger than that of the Galaxy Note II (3,100mAh), despite the Mega 6.3 being bigger (the screen especially). The NFC module is in the battery itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the battery is the combined microSIM / microSD card slot. The cards are stacked, the microSIM at the bottom and the microSD on top. The battery blocks the way, so you have to pull it out to change one of the cards. In fact, you'll probably have to remove the microSD card to swap the SIM card too, as it's hard to reach when the top slot is occupied.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New TouchWiz with lots of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 comes with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, the latest release of the Google platform available and the same as what the flagship GalaxyS4 has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of TouchWiz tries to stay relatively close to stock Android, but adds many options for customization and a host of new features. The amount of tweaks and options is overwhelming and can take days to fully appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface video to start you off, which also shows the new air and motion gestures in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features the new widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect but you can switch back to the old one, or disable it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News, Smart Remote and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greeting on the lockscreen can be changed - you can type something else, set a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the notification area there are five (eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the new button that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 20 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles. Another nice trick is to long press on a toggle to go to the related settings (e.g. Wi-Fi settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider, complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mega 6.3 homescreen auto-rotates, just like on tablets, enabling landscape use of the entire interface. Auto-rotation is more than welcome - the Note phablets don't have it. We like it that the Galaxy Mega doesn't stubbornly insist on being just a phone. The homescreen is a lot more comfortable to use in landscape, especially the dock icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - any of the available homescreen panes can be set as default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen, giving you an overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can check how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 comes with Multi-window, which lets you run two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the dividing line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen. That improves ergonomics a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tweaked the Settings screen to use a tabbed interface. There's four of them - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the relevant features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. The company has amassed an intimidating pile of features and options, but that's not a bad thing - the default setup is good enough for regular users, while power users get to have it their way without the need for third party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a side note, the TouchWiz on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 should be a good indication of what the Android 4.2 update for the Galaxy S III will be like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Air View and Smart Screen, S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 comes with a number of advanced features shared with the Galaxy S4. Some features are left exclusive to the flagship, but the Mega 6.3 still gets a good set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. There's no S Pen on the Galaxy Mega 6.3, or a need for it - the phone can detect your finger hovering over the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This enables information preview (e.g. texts, calendar entries and so on), previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (works with the previous button too), previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers 1cm / 0.5" away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you meant to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll and Smart Pause are not included although the Mega has the required hardware for it (a front-facing camera), unlike the Air Gestures, which need a special new sensor on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a number of motion gestures, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact whose info you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and Google's own Voice Actions - it can be used to initiate or answer a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set or snooze an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, take a photo, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, has the weather forecast for your location and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. Just like in the phonebook, you can choose what kind of content should be displayed - photos and videos from the phone, Dropbox, Facebook or Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover over an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail overview or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that album's stack of photos but a swipe to the right will list all albums. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode and easily select files from multiple folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 is great for viewing photos - the screen is as big as most photo frames and the lower resolution doesn't really show. The great viewing angles do, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can print photos straight from the gallery, though this only works on Samsung printers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it's an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive). We wish Samsung had the same sidebar with the folders on the left, just like in the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has folder support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name). Air View lets you hover over a square to see what kind of songs it holds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 can also search for content on third party DLNA servers like PCs or other phones on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 Smart Volume, which equalizes the volume between tracks. Adapt Sound from the S4 is also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a scrollable timeline, play/pause and skip controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, an AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent video player, but lacks codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timeline lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video. Samsung should probably retire this feature in favor of a Mutli-window app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big disappointment here is the relatively poor video codec support. It plays XviD, MP4 and MKV files of up to 1080p resolution, but DivX is not supported. AC3 and DTS sound also do not work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 has an 8MP camera, just like the Galaxy S III. It captures photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a 1.9MP camera on the front, but there's no dual-shot mode like on the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. A virtual shutter key and a capture video button are always available in the viewfinder, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the descriptions but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be used very often. Still, there're a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy Mega 6.3 will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the shortcuts available here, but most people will probably stick to the Mode selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are relatively few manual settings, the Galaxy Mega 6.3 just gives you an ISO setting, white balance and exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Rich Tone (HDR), Panorama, Night and Sports. Panoramas are not as impressive as on the Galaxy S4 - they come out with about 1000px vertical resolution (lower if you don't hold the phone steady). Here's a sample panorama - there are minor stitching problems, but nothing drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get into the more interesting shots. Eraser helps you remove moving objects (e.g. passers by walking into your shot).Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot. All the Galaxy Mega 6.3 would send is the still image, a JPEG, and the sound remains on the phone. Shame that Samsung didn't use the standard Audio note feature of JPEG photos for this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Samsung has copied most of the features of the Galaxy S4 camera, but left out some of the premium options. The 360 photo (Photo Sphere) is missing, there's no dual-shot or color effects, even the Cine photo (cinemagrams) has been dropped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Field of View is wider than that of the Galaxy S4, it's about the same as the S III has. That's good news since narrow FoV was one of the complaints we have against the S4 camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is a bizarre breed - a mix of mid-range and high-end features, an unusually big screen and no promised market. We welcome the more affordable alternative to the Galaxy Note phablets, but we're not 100% sold on the size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 is too big for single-handed use - you can do some things, but normally you will end up reaching for the screen with your other hand as your thumb fails to reach that pesky shortcut or button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the same time, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 would make a nice mini-tablet. It has a good screen for videos and browsing, blazing fast Wi-Fi 802.11ac and LTE, a good camera, expandable storage and just enough oomph for games. Plus, you can slip the Galaxy Mega 6.3 in your pocket easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet has a leg up on 7" tablets in all these categories - it certainly tops the likes of the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. So, we guess it comes down to price, which is not officially known at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 ? Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8 ? Samsung Galaxy Note II ? Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not to say that we can't see people using the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 as a primary device. Some value screen real estate over all else and the Mega is hard to beat on that front without having you break your piggy bank for it. The upcoming Galaxy Note III will offer the high-end experience (with a smaller screen most likely), but it will probably cost as much as the Mega 6.3 and 5.8 duo combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all this talk about screen size, we have to commend the Mega 6.3 design on being very space efficient, the ratio of screen to front surface area is very high. The relatively low weight (just 14g more than a Lumia 920) and 8mm thickness also make it reasonably portable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is clearly targeting users in the bigger-is-better camp, and keen to let everyone else know that bigger can also be cheaper. Exactly how much cheaper will be the big decider it seems.</paragraph>
