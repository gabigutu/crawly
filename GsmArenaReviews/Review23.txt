			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you've seen the Google Nexus One, you've seen the HTC Desire. End of story. We liked the Nexus One so be our guest, HTC Desire. But is it all that simple?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are so good they build phones for the competition. HTC are so mean they have no issues competing with their own clients. And is it us or are the clients ultimately left with a rather disturbing question: do HTC work for us or do we work for them? Go ask Sony Ericsson and Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't quite make sense to go as far back as the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 and the HTC Touch Pro. Today's story is about another couple of twins. And because the children are nearly identical, we'll try to see what it's like being mom's favorite or dad's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire produced a good deal of anticipation and its prompt release after this year's MWC proves HTC know good timing. But by no means can it match the hype that surrounded the Google Nexus One. What's in a name? No, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we're at it, any other - less cheesy - name would've really suited the top HTC Android better. But well, that's minor stuff compared to what's inside. Here it goes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Google Nexus One is still confined to selected countries, its twin, the HTC Desire, is already in stores across the globe. And that may be great news for users on markets still ungraced by Google. It's the same phone - take away the Google logo, and add a few nice little things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it's not the differences that you'll care about. It's what both devices have in common that make them so attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course we mean the large capacitive AMOLED touchscreen, the fresh Android OS v2.1 they run, the great performance on the 1GHz Snapdragon processor, and the 5-megapixel autofocus cameras they come with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, you'll notice that these are actually two different phones. The Nexus One's trackball is gone for an optical trackpad. The controls on the Desire are actual buttons instead of the capacitive keys on the Google phone. On the homescreen, you'll see the latest Sense UI waving Hello.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some platforms just don't seem to change for years. The Android OS is evolving at amazing speed. The Desire is one of the first devices to come with the latest version of the Android operating system but more importantly, being so powerful, it's among the few to reveal what ?clair is actually capable of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those lines sound as if the Desire is free from sin. It really isn't. There is always room for improvement - and that's especially true for Android handsets. But before we get to that, join us on the next page first to see what's hiding in that tiny retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny box of the HTC Desire has managed to accommodate pretty much everything you?d expect to get with a high-end phone. There?s a USB charger, a standard microUSB data cable and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a one-piece headset with music controls (play/pause/skip). The supplied headphones aren't your only option though, since the Desire has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also enclosed is a 4GB microSD card but, unlike the Nexus One, the Desire doesn?t come with a carrying pouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here's an unboxing video of the HTC Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire somehow fails to match the muscular style and the poise of the Hero ? we guess that?s the Legend?s job. Being so closely related to the Google Nexus One, the Desire has no other choice but keep it all minimalist and discreet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no doubt however who?s in charge. The Desire?s bigger 3.7? screen makes the finish and embellishments less relevant. For a screen this size, the size of phone is still friendly enough to handle and pocket. It measures 119 x 60 x 11.9 mm and weighs 135 g but its curved edges and dark two-tone finish make it look smaller than it actually is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of the differences between the Nexus One and HTC?s own version of the same device are easily visible on the outside. Some of them are welcome ? but there are also a couple of things we think worked better the Google way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen phones are not the best devices to get creative and experiment with design and the Desire is no exception. But HTC made the right choice going for a sturdy build and durability. Just like the Google Nexus One, the Desire is not only subtly stylish but also very solid. At its launch, the Desire showed up only in Brown but a few weeks later a silver version of the phone was also spotted in the wild.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire shares with the Nexus One a 3.7? capacitive AMOLED touchscreen of WVGA resolution. It looks marvelous indoors but if you go outside you won?t help but notice that sunlight legibility could?ve been better. It is the highly reflective surface and weaker backlighting that make it a bad choice for outdoor use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Desire screen is brilliant indoors. It?s not only large but has high resolution and excellent image quality. Colors are deep and vivid and contrast is great. Currently, in this size segment only the Samsung Galaxy S Super AMOLED display would do better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to screen sensitivity, the Desire reacts to the gentlest taps thanks to the capacitive technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only find the earpiece and two hidden sensors (proximity and ambient light).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen we find the typical Android controls (back, contextual menu, Home and search). This time around, they are actual press buttons instead of the capacitive keys of the Nexus One. The poor response of the Nexus keys was a letdown, so we welcome HTC?s decision to go for proper hardware knobs. They are tiny and discreet but with very distinct press ? so no worries this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-between them is the trackpad. It's not essential really - the touchscreen is more than enough to get you around the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, we liked the Nexus One trackball more. You may need some time to get used to that optical trackpad, it just doesn?t feel as nice. Part of the reason is perhaps its size ? it?s too small to fit the general design. The trackpad might come in handy if you need to jump links on a webpage or in document viewing. Other than that we don?t see why anyone would prefer it over the excellent response of the capacitive touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other obvious application that puts it to use is the camera - the Desire doesn?t have a dedicated shutter key. If you go for the trackpad, you'll need to press to lock focus and release to capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, unlike the optical trackpad on the HTC Legend, the one on the Desire also acts as a hardware button. It sinks in when you press it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire?s left side features a long and thin volume rocker and there is nothing on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the uncovered 3.5mm audio jack and the Screen Lock/Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece. The standard microUSB port accommodates both the charger and the data cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire rear only features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the small loudspeaker grill. There is also a small LED flash in-between to boost the camera's low-light performance but you shouldn't be expecting miracles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The material used on the back cover is described as soft-touch and it really does deserve the name. It?s really nice to touch ? it?s still plastic but the surface feels soft and provides a great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, you'll find both the microSD and the SIM card slots and the 1400 mAh battery right next to them. The Desire is quoted at up to 6 hours 40 minutes of talk time and up to 360 hours of stand-by time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To reach the microSD card slot, you have to remove the battery first. So, hot swap is out of the question. In the retail package we found a 4GB microSD card but the device worked trouble-free with our 16GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire is Google Nexus One?s twin and it?s no more than a few details that set the two phones apart. In terms of build quality, no news is good news ? the Desire is solidly built using high-quality materials. Slim and heavy, the phone has an excellent hand feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire has a subtle hint of a chin and the hardware buttons earn it a point over the Nexus One?s capacitive controls. On the other hand, we do prefer the trackball over the tiny trackpad. The non-hot-swappable memory card and the inadequate sunlight legibility are the only things that you may want to consider. On the other hand, the AMOLED screen is pure quality indoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting on the next page, we're on Android 2.1 territory. Hit the jump to the user interface and applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sense likes it on big screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero pioneered the Sense UI on Android handsets to tap the company?s existing user base. The Tattoo was the next HTC-customized device, but Sense just didn?t feel natural on the QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire is Legend?s bigger brother upping the CPU and RAM, along with screen size and resolution. It runs the latest Android v2.1 and takes full advantage of its performance boost and full color support. As a result, the pre-loaded Sense UI is faster, more attractive and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main differences between this Sense UI version and the one back on the Hero are the new context icons, a bunch of new wallpapers and the unified Widget section. Whether you are using the People, Mail, Music or Gallery Tabs, the scrollable icons at the bottom will please you with new color skins. We like it this way ? the old ones looked a bit dull against the otherwise graphically rich and colorful UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also acknowledge the role of the AMOLED display in making the new Sense UI look even more attractive compared to HTC Hero?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s take a closer look for those who haven?t met the latest Sense UI yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow button at the bottom of the screen that used to pull the main menu up is now gone, replaced with three virtual keys and an arched scrollbar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left key launches the main menu. This time around you simply tap to get to it, you can't drag the menu out, though you can drag it back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Add to Home" menu. And there's plenty to add to the homescreen but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on - it can't be used for actual scrolling. HTC have extended the homescreen to a total of seven panes instead of the usual three (in stock Android). Even if it sounds too much, with all those widgets (which are quite useful too) it may not even be enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, they?ve added a fancy new way to access any homescreen without scrolling. A press on the home button will show all the seven desktops in small thumbs. Tapping on a thumb will get you right on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense UI revolves around Scenes, which are essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't modify the scenes but if you rearrange the current homescreen you are prompted to save changes as a new scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clean slate scene in turn lets you start from scratch - it's just the default Android setup with a Clock and a few shortcuts underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization - the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are far from perfect though: the Travel scene has the HTC Footprints widget but nothing on GPS or maps. And as we already mentioned, you can?t edit the default scenes. Your only option is to save a new modified Travel scene under a different name along with the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now back to the other stuff beyond the homescreen and the available Scenes. The changes brought by the Sense UI go deeper than just the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, the main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch it to a list similar to what you see in TouchFLO in HTC WinMo phones. With it, you can use an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget section has been revamped since the HTC Hero and now both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed in one page. There are so many of them that you may find the seven homescreen panes short.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions - most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget, different look (There are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And some widget styles even offer different functionality. Take the Twitter widget for instance - one version also shows updates for the people you follow, while the other version only lets you tweet right on the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC widgets offer a better level of interaction than the stock widgets - there's a Favorites widget that keeps a list of your favorite contacts you can scroll through, no need to get to the contact list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend Stream shows the latest status updates of your friends. To use this widget you must link your profile to Facebook and have matching friends to your phone?s contact. After this is done properly, their latest updates will be noted in the Friend Stream widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo album widget is a "stack" of photos that shows all the photos in some folder and you can flick them to view the next photo in line. This is quite fun but the experience is somewhat ruined by optimization - during the animation of the photo going up and the next one settling in, the widget uses low resolution previews of the photos and it takes a couple of seconds for the next image to load up in full quality. Higher-res photos suffer the most from this, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages and Mail widgets work much the same way, but instead of photos, you scroll messages. And you don't get the pixelation issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.1 offers animated wallpapers and the Desire has plenty of those preloaded. They look impressive, extend over all of the homescreen panes and don?t slow the interface at all. You may even choose the Nexus One original wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that?s about the part of the Sense UI that?s closest to the surface. There?s more to it but we?ll discuss those bits and pieces throughout the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire UI is generally fast and we must give credit for that to the faster CPU and the optimized software. This time around the UI performance is great - even with lots of files on the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only noticeable slowdown is with widgets that need internet connection to refresh content, but that?s completely normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the HTC Desire compares to the Legend and Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and PiBenchmark apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new trackpad is an auxiliary navigation tool here ? given the responsive capacitive touchscreen. You can swipe, scroll and precisely select elements with the trackpad, but sometimes you?d swipe your finger over it incidentally. The hardware keys are very close to the trackpad itself, so be careful there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found ourselves barely using the trackpad except in the camera app, where it serves as the shutter key. Even there, it?s non essential, as the touch focus works well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more things - most apps won't run without a microSD card inserted and screen vibration feedback works on the virtual QWERTY keyboard but nowhere else on the homescreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook we like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire features the same powerful phonebook we first saw on the Hero, and then the Legend. It resembles the one on the HTC TouchFLO but considerably extends its functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a contact's details presents you with the basic info for the contact - name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs at the bottom and you're just viewing the first of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it held the entire conversation, but for that you?d have to go to the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact. The next two tabs are quite interesting and can turn the Legend (or in fact any phone running the Sense UI) into a powerful social networking tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other -called "Albums" - pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your buddies? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen looks exactly as in the Hero. There's no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy - just press the search button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality in calls is quite good, even though the Desire lacks the noise-cancellation secondary mic of the Nexus One. In ear volume level is great ? you don?t have to set it on maximum to have a nice audible sound. Reception is trouble-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features a keypad, a call log shortcut and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). Smart Dialing is also available ? no news since the HTC Hero, but quite an achievement compared to most other droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in proximity sensor makes sure the screen automatically switches off when you hold it next to your face during a call. That way you don?t risk pressing any keys by mistake with your ear or cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC Desire a familiar cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows the latest dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire doesn't have voice dialing enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and here is how the Desire stacks among some other handsets we?ve tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging full of goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. Google Talk is in charge of instant messaging. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard in the HTC Desire works in both portrait and landscape modes. The individual button size is decent and sensitivity is just fine and we had no problems using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Androids, if you have only one incoming SMS, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the SMS section is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads. Each thread is labeled by the names of the recipients and shows the number of messages in the thread and part of the last message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the display are the tap-to-compose box and the send key of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 10 or fewer characters remaining to the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as the text box only takes a small part of the screen even if you hide the keyboard, which really only gives you little to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. After choosing a name it?s added in a bubble under the main textbox, where you can view or remove it by single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsent messages are marked with a warning sign, but draft messages that used to stay in the thread with a red "Draft" label next to them, are now kept separately in the dedicated Draft section. This makes continuing drafts harder. In the Magic, text in the compose box was kept right there instead of forcing the user to go back to the Drafts folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Mail and Gmail reports for duty</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets. There are a few HTC add-ons, but nothing major. The batch operations are onboard - they allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slightly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or the generic mail client, and set one of the two options as default. The reason behind most Android handsets coming with two email clients is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom HTC Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there are five virtual buttons that change the inbox view to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or display the messages from your VIP mail groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversations view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the HTC mail inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand. Attachments are not automatically loaded by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Desire lacks in terms of email capabilities. What you basically have is a local copy of your Gmail account bundled with its main functionality plus a Microsoft Exchange compatible alternative client, which can manage multiple POP and IMAP accounts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia evolution: slow but getting there<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual main menu list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder - quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery undertakes reindexing of the content each time you open it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. And that's a bugger as when cards are full of content, it's quite slow to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a figure indicating the number of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons - one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and finally - Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images, share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa, and delete the current image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Desire image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip view. You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire supports multi-touch and you can take the full advantage of this while browsing your images. Zooming in and out is done in the same fashion as on the Apple iPhone. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one here is extra smooth - just as it is on the iPhone (and those are 5 megapixel images we're talking about here).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is good, native DivX still to come<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums' subfolder as there is no separate icon for the video player in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip, and can be shared via Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC Desire has seen some minor visual changes, but is still quite basic. You may opt for full screen mode, where the original clip is stretched / cropped to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite contrary to initial rumor, the player is capable of only playing 3GP and MP4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the go HTC Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of the MP4 files we tried on the Desire played super smooth without dropped frames or sound lags. We tested videos of up to 640x360 pixel resolution at 30fps and they ran trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is already a player in the Android market that supports DivX and XviD videos. The yxflash player handled well much of the files (trailers and sample videos) we threw at it although anything above VGA resolution was obviously too much for the hardware. We also tried a standard XviD TV-ripped show (624x352@24fps, 350MB) with and without subtitles, but in either cases there were annoying lags to ruin the experience. The bad news continues with that you only get the trial version for free and after it expires you need to pay 9.9 US dollars for the full app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don?t give up on the native player yet. HTC promised to release a firmware update soon, bringing DivX support and 720p video encoding. We?re certainly looking forward.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tabbed music player with ?cover flow? interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most of the multimedia department, the music player is basically the same as what we saw on the Legend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable, doesn't offer new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find no contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff on YouTube or Google. The other music player weaknesses of the Android platform still need addressing too - no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling between them. It also supports RDS and allows playback through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire pulls off the same remarkable audio quality as the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10, but is louder in terms of earphones volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the two frequency response graphs are so similar that we suspect a similar (or maybe identical) hardware has been used inside the two Android flagships. We suspect that HTC have found a way to pump up the volume a bit higher, which has naturally led to the minimal differences you see in the table below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate the Desire readings are excellent all over, the HTC handset pulling one of the best all-round performances that we have ever seen. Check it out for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire has a 5 megapixel sensor for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels, and a LED flash. This is becoming pretty much the norm for recent upper mid-range and high-end Android handsets so the HTC seems to be on level ground with its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However thanks to Android 2.1, the Desire boasts a camera interface that is quite competitive outside the Google OS world too. There are a number of customizable settings ranging from ISO speed to aspect ratio and auto focus. Now, that makes perhaps the Omnia HD owners sneer but it?s a nice improvement for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see modern-day features such as face and smile detection, for example, but the gap is closing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the usability is still pretty bad with most of the options sitting on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder which can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get shortcuts for setting the flash and exposure compensation right in the viewfinder but that?s pretty much that. The only other shortcut leads to the gallery and that hardly helps much the photography itself. Touch focus is enabled ? and you can even go ahead and capture a shot. The other option is the trackpad ? it serves as a shutter key. The bad thing is it doesn?t have dual action for autofocus and capture. You just press and the handset takes care of locking focus and taking the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch focus gives you a bit more flexibility ? a tap will lock focus, but you can skip the shot. A tap and hold will lock focus on the part of the frame where you want it, and the shot will be captured as you lift your thumb. Anyway, using the whole touchscreen to capture isn?t the most comfortable thing. In the end, nothing beats a proper shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first we thought the Desire was a rather poor shooter, but we received a second unit straight from a retail store and it was much better than the one we got from HTC as a test sample. We've edited the article accordingly and all camera samples have been replaced with the better ones. Unfortunately, video quality and framerate is still quite disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, image quality of the HTC Desire camera is nice and definitely better than the Legend,which we sourced from a retail source as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But back to the HTC Desire camera, as we look at the new samples there's a decent amount of resolved detail and the contrast is now much better. Noise levels however have remained relatively high (though tolerable) and you can easily see a pinkish spot in the center of the frame (like the one on HTC HD2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Desire. You can check out what that test is all about here. As we mentioned, you can easily see a pinkish spot in the center of the frame when you shoot lightly-colored subjects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WVGA video at only 15 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire manages WVGA videos at 15 fps. The resolution is excellent for an Android handset, but the frame rate is rather disappointing. There is no word in the official specs sheet on the fps so we are unable to confirm if the 15 frames meet the specs or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one of the still camera and by usual Android standards there are tons of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, encoding type and recording limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image adjustments are concerned, you get exposure compensation, contrast, saturation and sharpness settings as well as color effects and white balances settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus is also there for you to enable but the Desire only focuses before the recording starts and acts as a fixed focus camera after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality is below average at the optimum settings. The amount of resolved detail is not enough, the colors are washed-out, the low contrast issues are visible here too and there are some compression artifacts but this is nothing to frown at too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with lower resolution settings remains the same ? both frame rate and video quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are rumors about DivX 720p video recording coming up within the next firmware update along with the native DivX support itself. It would be really nice if this comes out to be true, since the Desire was expected to sport 720p video encoding on its announcement. But if HTC keeps the current fps and quality achievement, this update will be worthless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample WVGA@15fps video clip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire offers a full set of connectivity options to have on a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE securing worldwide roaming capabilities and dual-band (900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA. The HSDPA is quoted at 7.2Mbps and the HSUPA can reach up to 2Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to local connectivity ? the Desire offers USB v2.0 connectivity via a microUSB port, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. Now that they?ve enabled Bluetooth transfers, there is very little more to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet tethering is also available via the microUSB port and it?s as easy as it gets to activate. Just select tethering when the handset prompts you to select how to connect to your computer and you are good to go. HTC have also thought of people without a data plan and allow you to explicitly forbid the handset to access the mobile network for data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash runs in the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The great web browsing skills have been an inherent part of the Android platform since day one. Now that we are to version 2.1 things are even sweeter with the intuitive user interface even more polished and the functionality reaching new heights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. With pinch-zooming enabled you don?t even need the +/- zoom buttons that we have seen on most other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is locked at the top of the page so you can scroll down and hide that too. However you don?t need to scroll to the top every time you want to tap a new address ? just press the menu button and invoke it anywhere on the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which make it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to sweeten the deal even more HTC Desire has Flash support in its web browser. Its performance is better than the Legend and the Hero?s, but sadly not perfect. Simpler Flash games for example run just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Flash video support is pretty dodgy, the Desire failing to open the Vimeo and Netcafe videos that we tried. YouTube works fine but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application anyway so it doesn?t really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.1 browser supports HTML5 and its video tag but since that?s a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm, we won?t be crediting it with extra points.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and Quick Office as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire comes with the usual set of organizing apps. It has a preinstalled document viewer (not all droids do), which handles office files just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the Quickoffice app, which has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For editing, you will need to get the paid app though. There is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Desire in? well a Desk clock ? it displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the Desire with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be pretty useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which allows you to update your profile on the world?s largest social networks. Not that you couldn?t have downloaded it yourselves but it?s nice that HTC saved you the effort.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation lacks voice-guidance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got satellite lock in just over two minutes without the A-GPS on, which isn?t bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the Desire as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is available only in the US, but the rest of the world is in no luck here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it is better than nothing but you still have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. Pinch-zooming works like a charm, but you also have the on-screen controls and double-tap zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Street View mode is supported in Google Maps and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps - it gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t another preinstalled navigation application, so if you want one, you will have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps growing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire runs Android 2.1 and the Android Market has quite a lot to offer. With the number of applications growing by the hour and no low-res restrictions, the choice of apps is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps on the Android market and with the most vital ones covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.), the advantage of the market-leading AppStore may be less prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, 30000 or so apps is nowhere near what the iPhone users have at their disposal but no one actually installs thousands of apps so you will probably find what you are looking for here too. Besides, the Android market is the one with the largest percentage of free apps across all platforms and thousands apps are cooking or waiting approval right now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks and modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire has 512MB ROM and almost 80% of it is used or reserved for the Android OS. This leaves you with 120MB free space for all your apps and games. As you may know, the Android OS still doesn?t support installation on memory cards or even extended inbuilt storage (such as the 8/16 GB of the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S, which are listed as internal drive). So you have only 120MB to install what you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s true that Android apps on the Market are generally small (0.5 ? 2 MB), but still it?s a shame for a high-end device like the Desire to have limited internal storage. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 comes with 1GB, almost half of which is user-available. HTC could have done better for the Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, there is only one workaround for getting apps to install on your memory card and it starts with rooting your device. However success is not guaranteed on the HTC Desire, so far the steps have only been tested on the G1 and the Nexus One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to hacking your smartphone, always make sure you know what you're doing and that you have a backup plan in case things go wrong. Good luck with modding the HTC Desire.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One was given the grace of a market head start but it?s no longer standing lonely at the top. And even if it looks like a brotherly reunion, the HTC Desire is in fact a formidable rival. That?s between HTC and Google though. Users have hardly reasons to complain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The limited availability of the Nexus One only works in the HTC Desire?s favor. The HTC Desire ships worldwide and its current street price is around 440 euro. That?s just a bit more than the Google Nexus One and it won?t be long perhaps before they?re level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the differences, the HTC Desire seems to get the upper hand but it?s not just quite as capable as promised. DivX support and 720p video recording didn?t make it on time, although there?s word of including them in a future update. The HTC Desire comes with the company?s proprietary Sense UI on top of the E'clair and Flash support in the web browser. We do prefer the hardware buttons to the Nexus One?s capacitive controls but the trackpad doesn?t quite cut it. We?d take the trackball any day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Google Nexus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the complicated family issues aside, let?s look at a real competitor. The recently unveiled I9000 Galaxy S is Samsung?s most powerful Android smartphone ? and quite keen to challenge for the top spot. Featuring a breathtaking four inches of Super AMOLED display and a fast 1GHz processor, the Galaxy S also runs E'clair and offers a 5-megapixel snapper. What?s more, codec support and high-res video are all there so HTC better hurry with that upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 has the older Donut (Android OS v1.6) and its price is steep. The X10 is still quite a catch though. It has a Snapdragon inside and a bigger screen too. The real edge over the Android rivals however is the 8-megapixel autofocus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this is the latest in Android and we have no reason to be disappointed. The Desire is confidently taking charge of the HTC Android lineup. With gadgets like the Hero and the Legend behind it, this is one of the most impressive droid fleets these days. The HTC Desire has the background and the inspiration, and it has some bonus hype, courtesy of the Nexus One. Out of two identical phones, most users will of course get the one that?s more readily available.</paragraph>
