			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original MILESTONE was the lifeline by which Motorola pulled themselves out of their deathbed. And now the once ailing giant breathes again ? but is in no mood to rest or make peace. Instead, it?s breathing fire on the enemies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola had itself a true droid army in almost no time ? and the best thing is it?s not an army of clones. Creative designs and rich equipment helped the company make an emphatic comeback, and the XT720 is focused on keeping up that momentum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as simple as calling it a sequel ? a QWERTY-less alternative of the original MILESTONE. 8 megapixels and a Xenon flash for a physical keyboard is a trade-off many users would be delighted to accept. But the Motorola XT720 is keen to offer more. It packs its punch with character and personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 will certainly be up against some tough competition. There are bigger screens out there and devices with better specs. And it?s not a Snapdragon either, something that?s become almost standard at the high end. But the next MILESTONE for Motorola doesn?t come unarmed. Let?s take a look at the highlights of its spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging by the list above this Droid is putting all the eggs in the camera basket. 8 MP stills and 720p videos are the best Android has to offer and this is the first time they come together on a single handset. And Xenon is a first for the platform. HDMI out is still novel enough to be a key selling point on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though the MILESTONE XT720 is not currently running the latest version of Android, Motorola promise to deliver the Froyo update in due course so there?s no reason to get upset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now about to check out if the performance is there to match the specs. We start with the styling and hardware right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First thing first, let?s look what?s hiding in the box. Along with the handset itself, you will find the increasingly popular two-piece charger-data cable combo. The socket outlet charger head couples with the USB cable to create a full featured charger. USB charging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice surprises are the supplied HDMI cable and the generous 8GB microSD card. That kind of cable is still rare and it?s nice of Motorola to save users some bucks by including it in the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headphones and the usual bunch of paperwork are the other items in the box. It?s a one-piece headset meaning that if you want to replace the headphones you will lose the remote.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola MILESTONE XT720 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is slightly above the average size of a handset with a 3.7? touchscreen. At 116 x 60.9 x 10.9 mm, it is quite comfortable to handle, helped by the unusually curved shapes. We do like the styling of the Motorola XT720 and think the design accents actually make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the bezel looks bigger than you?d expect, creating an impression of badly used space. Let?s not forget though that an 8MP module and a Xenon flash do need a lot of room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is on the heavier side at 142 grams. That?s a little more than the Nexus One and notably heavier than the Galaxy S. The XT720 is not that much lighter than the steel-covered original MILESTONE with its side-sliding QWERTY keyboard. And while we certainly appreciate the solid feel we think a warning is due here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE XT720 is not just another slab of a phone. The asymmetric face is certain to pique your curiosity and the unusually sculpted rear does send the right message: fine tech inside, raw power on the outside. Photos may not tell the whole story but the XT720 is certainly a phone for those who like to be surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphite mirror finish up front doesn?t seem to match the blue rubbery back but it?s a contrast that we like. And the unusual shapes do well to highlight the phone?s top features. The clean straight line of the façade interrupted to form a bump. And there you go ? the shutter key is there, comfortably raised and ready for action. Around back, the phone is shaped so that the 8MP camera lens and the Xenon module are prominently raised. The Motorola XT720 is a high-end cameraphone and wants to leave you in no doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike most design experiments that dare challenge the standard, the final result is quite convincing. The great choice of materials also helps the unusual styling. Most of the handset?s case is made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The steel plates on the back are covered with a rubbery coating that?s nice and soft to touch and virtually fingerprint resistant. It doesn?t really give any better grip but the handset is comfortable enough to hold anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the handset is dominated by the 3.7? widescreen LCD display with a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The capacitive unit has great response, with crisp and vibrant images indoors. The brightness is very good and the contrast levels are decent, though not particularly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the sunlight legibility of the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 display is a letdown. When outside on a bright sunny day, you can hardly make out what?s on the display and that certainly hurts usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a triangle of sensors that vaguely resembles Predator?s 3-point laser sight from the classic movie. The vertical pair are proximity sensors in charge of locking the touchscreen during calls. The single one at the side picks up the ambient light to automatically adjust screen brightness. Next to them are the earpiece and the Motorola logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the display are four capacitive keys in charge of Android navigation: contextual menu key, Home key, back and search buttons. The XT720 doesn?t have hardware Call keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last things to note up front are the three backlit icons placed vertically on the ?chin? in the bottom right corner. Each of those has a LED underneath, indicating the imaging mode currently in use: gallery, still camera or camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the side of handset ? exactly at the raised bit is the dedicated imaging button to switch between the gallery and the two camera modes. Right next to it is a thin but reasonably tactile camera key ? soft and responsive, with distinct half press. Further up on that right hand side is the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Motorola MILESTONE XT720 features the microUSB port, which is used for both data transfers and charging. It?s covered by a small plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a similar cover for the microHDMI port which is on the top of the handset, next to the exposed 3.5mm audio jack and the power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is completely bare, but for the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back on the other hand is rather crowded. Here we find the 8 megapixel camera lens, an AF assist light and the xenon flash unit. The loudspeaker is also here, with a prominent black grill in the lower half of the phone. The final noteworthy element here is the second microphone used for noise-cancelling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the BP6X Li-Po battery. It is said to provide up to 750 hours of stand-by or 13 and a half hours of talk-time in a 2G network, which sounds pretty impressive. In 3G mode the respective numbers are quite good too at up to 576 hours of standby and 6 and a half hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life, the MILESTONE XT720 lasted for just under two days of moderate use. We took over a dozen photos, browsed the web for just under an hour over Wi-Fi and spent about 30 minutes on the other phone features each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is excellent and the handset seems built to last. To dispel any doubts you might have, the phone is also quite comfortable to handle. Most importantly though, the XT720 is a device with personality. We liked the contrast between the front and rear, the surprising mix of advanced technology and old-school looking angular design.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto Eclair<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is running on the already established and solid Android 2.1 Eclair. There is no doubt the XT720 is a gadget of interest because of its excellent hardware specs and premium imaging capabilities. The Xenon flash accompanying the 8 megapixel sensor and the ability to capture HD videos is definitely something that makes it a winner with mobile phone fans. At least on paper, that is. Let?s see how it fares in everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the cornerstone of the Android UI. Giving you five screen panes worth of space (by default), it helps you put up front all the items you use most frequently. And there are plenty of things that can go up there. You have shortcuts to applications or media of your choice, then folders and, finally, widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make the orientation easier Motorola has added small dots in the bottom ends of the screen. Thanks to those marks you will always know which screen you are currently on. If you tap and hold on any of them you?ll get thumbs of all homescreens for quick switching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders can help you keep the shortcuts organized but you can't put folders within folders. Still, they can be used for a few quick tricks ? like faking a quick-dial contact list. A contact's photo serves as a dial shortcut so all you have to do is put a bunch of them in a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s nothing too special about that ? it's when live folders come into play that it gets exciting. The main difference to ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All sorts of lists can go into Live folders. For example, you can have a folder that contains all the tweets from a contact, or an RSS feed, or maybe even a folder with all the good restaurants within walking distance from a given location. The preinstalled Live folders are "Contacts with phone numbers" and "Starred contacts". Naturally, they are filled with your Gmail contacts that either have phone numbers or are starred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other inhabitants of the Android homescreen are the widgets. There are plenty of them that come with the Android v2.1: a corporate calendar (simply the one synced with your Exchange account), a Weather widget, Power control widget (a handy connectivity manager for your desktop), Picture Frame, Search Toolbox, World Clock, YouTube, Music Player, FM radio, Latitude, Analog Clock and Alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional search widget shows suggestions as you type, just like the Google homepage. It searches local files or gives you a shortcut to initiate a web search, which is a really neat solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is also intact. It shows status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the MILESTONE XT720 you press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. The "task switcher" is a quick way to access six of the most recently used apps but it?s not a task manager per se. In fact, Android automatically opens and closes applications. When resources start to run out, it might close a currently inactive app but it will restore it back to just how you left it. It's more like the system puts the app to hibernation instead of closing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you really want to manage the memory by yourself, Motorola included a real task manager on the XT720. It even has its own shortcut on the task switcher screen. That?s something we miss on the Galaxy S and the original MILESTONE. You can terminate any application or system process from there. Good job!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 compares to Samsung Galaxy S in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and BenchmarkPi apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The smartphone phonebook can store a serious amount of information about your contacts. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contact feature introduced by Android 2.0 allows you to call, text, or email the person with a single click on their photo (or photo placeholder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add an IM nickname to a contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details are displayed in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contact listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the one for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any part of the image you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy - just hit the search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The ringer is loud enough so you don?t need to always set the volume to maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the MILESTONE XT720, just like the rest of the Motorola?s droid crew doesn?t feature Smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. You can easily search them by flick scrolling. Voice dialing is not available though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold in next to your ear for a call. There is no chance of ever hitting an on-screen button with your cheek on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola MILESTONE XT720. The MILESTONE XT720 snatched a good mark, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is doing well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department is quite straightforward and simple at first glance ? there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long ? under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novelty, brought by the original MILESTONE and also present here is the new option that allows you to preset the number of messages recorded in each thread. Once that number is exceeded the oldest message gets deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another returning cool extra is the search functionality that allows you to quickly find a specific message among all your saved SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since the text box with the message still occupies a very small part of the screen giving you quite a small part of the text to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The list of recipients is maintained in a "Name and Number" format, which is a welcome improvement over version 1.0, which added only the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature introduced by Android 2.0 is the aggregated inbox, which combines all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. There is also exchange support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Familiar gallery, downsizes images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 gallery is identical to the one found on the Nexus One, Galaxy S, etc. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. The gallery has 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be sorted by date by pressing the button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you dig deeper into sub-folders, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back several levels to the folder you need (similar to how the Explorer on Windows 7 works).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 multi-touch support but you can also use double tap or even the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, you can't zoom in on images up to 100%. Obviously the gallery displays only downsized versions of your pics and you need to transfer them to a computer if you're into pixel-peeping. This is not the first time we meet this restriction, the Samsung?s flagship Galaxy S also has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media gallery we previously met on the original MILESTONE is also on board. It has the same functionality and behavior as the native Android one, it just looks different.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player with limited XviD support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player itself is as simple and limited as it could possibly be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You just hit the video box in the gallery to get a list of all videos available on the phone. And the controls while playing a video boil down to play/pause, next and previous buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is pretty limited with DivX and XviD nowhere to be seen, at least officially. We tried a few samples and we found the XT720 to handle XviD videos of up to WQVGA resolution and no longer than 10-20 minutes. Bigger files (both resolution and time) seem to need more processing power than MILESTONE XT720 can offer. Of course that can?t be entirely true since it plays its own HD videos captured with the camcorder. The only logical explanation is the lack of proper software support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player could use an update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the music player saw no updates in Android 2.0 and 2.1. Don?t get us wrong, the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is not too bad at managing your audio files but there?s definitely room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the music player has four large buttons, which cover the four ways to sort your music collection ? by artist, album, song or by user-created playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the music player hasn't changed much. It has that great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song in YouTube or Google search by holding down your finger on a song. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabet scroll which appears on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing though. There are no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 20 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola MILESTONE XT720 performed quite impressively in our audio quality test. It's one of the loudest handset we have seen and it also delivers nicely clean output with audio tracks sounding just the way they were meant to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is spot on with the greatest deviation being the 0.16 dB, a value only detectable in lab conditions. The noise level and stereo crosstalk readings are great and so are the distortion levels and the dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the detailed results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE XT720 vs Motorola BACKFLIP frequency response</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera in focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 packs an 8 megapixel autofocus camera and a xenon flash ? a combo unseen on an Android handset so far. Needless to say, it is the key selling point and the performance is of utmost importance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface isn?t the best we?ve seen, neither for its user-friendliness nor the functionality offered. You only get four shortcuts right in the viewfinder to handle scene modes, flash settings, exposure compensation, gallery and shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of other features but you will have to dig deeper in the menu to find them. Face detection, image stabilization and various resolution settings are some of the available options. You can also set up a custom email address to send all your photos to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no touch-focus here, but we won?t make fuss ? the Milestone XT720 has an excellent shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we do miss however is some kind of control over the image quality. You know, things like contrast, sharpness and saturation settings. An alternative metering mode wouldn?t go amiss either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least when it comes to the image quality, the MILESTONE XT720 does deliver. The images are a bit over-processed, but retain good contrast and warm punchy colors. Just a tad too aggressive noise reduction tends to wipe away some fine detail, but fails to deal with all the noise in low-contrast areas of the frame (look at those noisy skies). Overall however, the image quality is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xenon flash is another disappointment for its limited range. It still does a better job than all LED and double-LEDs out there, but the difference isn?t as big as you would?ve hoped for. Given that you can?t use Xenon as a video light, Moto might have been better off sticking to LED here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Motorola MILESTONE XT720. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the specs might trick you into thinking that the MILESTONE XT720 is one of the best video recording droids, this is far from the truth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s, except that there are even fewer settings. There is no video light and the only available scene is night mode, but this is by far not the worst of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the videos themselves that disappoint the most with their extremely high compression and low framerate. Once again, Motorola have slightly tweaked up color saturation and contrast so everything looks punchier, but the 18-20 fps framerate is really way too low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And all that resolution lost due to the high compression makes HD recording more of a marketing gimmick than a really useful feature in the case of the Motorola MILESTONE XT720.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple 720p video samples uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a full untouched 720p video sample by the MILESTONE XT720</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s a complete connectivity set on the Motorola MILESTONE XT720. For starters you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for worldwide roaming and dual-band (1700/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA. Download speeds will potentially reach 10.2 Mbps, upload maxes out at 5.76 Mbps (theoretically that is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to local connectivity, the MILESTONE has USB v2.0, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier. And now that they have enabled Bluetooth file transfers, there is very little more to be asked for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing missing is tethering ? we just couldn?t get our XT720 to do it. Well the Froyo update should partially make up for that by adding Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities, but having the wired connection as an option certainly doesn?t hurt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back on the positive track, we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser, no Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On a big high-res screen and a browser as powerful as the Android variety, the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 makes browsing a pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is completely minimalist (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and bookmarks shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls auto-hide ? that?s essential for web apps because they need to have the whole screen estate to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE XT720 supports two zoom methods in the browser: double tap and the multi-touch pinch zooming. Text reflow isn?t available but that?s not a major flaw given the high-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key six new virtual buttons pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark view shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked pages and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excellent multi-page support is of course still available and the rendering algorithm is basically flawless. The missing Flash support is on the only thing going against the MILESTONE XT720 at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube. The Froyo update should sort things out with full Flash support on the MILESTONE XT720.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well-heeled organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its Android siblings, the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 comes with a rich set of organizer features and a document viewer to boot. Not that getting one from the Android market is impossible but it?s nice of Moto to have saved you the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is their app of choice and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF). For editing, you will need to upgrade to the paid version though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, which makes viewing attachments easy. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them in the phone's memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. It is also integrated with the new status bar and also offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE XT720 features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the YouTube app partially makes up for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to allow you to find what you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 comes with a capable GPS receiver which locked onto satellites in just over a minute with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that the Google Maps applications comes preinstalled, but this time you also get Motorola's proprietary MOTONAV software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the titular application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps is only available in select countries and unless you live in any of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola MOTONAV on the other hand is only available for a two-month trial. So if you want to use proper navigation on your MILESTONE you will have to either purchase a MOTONAV license or download a third party app off the Android Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is where the 3rd party apps live<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of apps in the market is ever growing and a recent survey showed that it has the highest free-to-paid apps ratio out of all the app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists subcategories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. Do keep an eye on this tab ? when updates become available for an app you?ve installed, a label shows up next to the app name to notify you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications range from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell), through fun (e.g. a virtual guitar) to real must-haves (including task killers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is certainly a handset that wants to make a difference. Its incredibly sturdy feel and a design that sets its apart from the crowd are probably its two strongest points. The very solid still imaging also counts in its favor, as long as you don?t have too high expectations for the xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for the MILESTONE XT720, its other key selling feature is a major letdown. The HD video recording is not worth the effort at all. There are some other minor flaws like no DivX/XviD support, which are hardly a big deal in isolation but might tip the scales against the Milestone XT720. It?s just that competition in this segment of the market is so fierce that almost no mistakes are allowed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 will give you a bit of extra screen estate in exchange for the xenon flash and the (anyway useless) HD videos. The XPERIA flagship also packs the home-brewed Timescape and Mediascape UI and a snappier CPU. Its main disadvantage is the dated Android version (though the upgrade is presumably just around the corner). Sony Ericsson also promised to enable 720p video recording on the XPERIA X10 with that update, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the HTC Desire trumps with an AMOLED screen and a Snapdragon to balance out those 8MP stills. It will get Froyo soon and that should raise its video recording capabilities to HD heights. On top of that, it also packs the superior Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you can check out the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S, or some of its local carrier-customized versions. The 4? SuperAMOLED display is enough of a selling point on its own, but it also has a faster CPU than the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 and does better video recording. It?s no match for the XT720 for still imaging with a 5 megapixel camera and no flash but can easily play any HD video you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the recently reviewed Acer Stream also deserves a look. It managed to surprise us with a good specs package and unique Acer Touch 3D UI over the stock Android OS v2.1. It offers a 5 megapixel camera and lacks the xenon flash, but is still a good deal. The Stream does the HD video recording thingy, but also plays XviD videos up to HD resolution. It also has microHDMI port, just as the MILESTONE XT720. The difference is the price is not that big and in favor of Stream, so if you are looking for something fresh and unique, and you can forgive the lack of premium camera features, then Acer Stream is a tempting deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Stream</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see it?s not a clear choice between the MILESTONE XT720 and any of those other premium phones, which however all have the advantage of being earlier to the market. So their prices are likely to have already settled down, while the MILESTONE XT720 price is still a bit inflated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course this all depends on where you live and the deals you can get from your local carrier so ultimately it will come down to a personal choice. Depending on the price you get and how willing you are to live with a slower CPU, the MILESTONE XT720 might just turn out to be a pretty good deal in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It obviously doesn?t quite have enough to be the ultimate cameraphone droid. But there?s no shortage of sharpshooters in the Android ranks. And that?s impressive growth for which Motorola can claim due credit.</paragraph>
