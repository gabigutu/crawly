			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is a smartphone approved for all audiences. Perhaps in hindsight, our Galaxy Note review should've been rated PG. But well yeah, we're always wiser in hindsight. Anyway, you don?t just wake up one morning wanting a superphone like the Note. You need a place to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is one little step above dumbphones. It won?t be long before you know how big this step really was. Android is friendly, especially in a package like the Galaxy Y, and highly addictive. And there's plenty to explore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is most likely someone's first smartphone. It comes on the cheap so you don't have to ask yourself if you really need all the extra features. Soon enough, you'll be wondering how you could live without them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And no, the Galaxy Y isn't full of the latest tech. It keeps things neat and simple at a very reasonable price. There's a good package of preinstalled apps and a full connectivity set. The reasonably fast processor and the very recent Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread are a bit of surprise. This is a basic smartphone but one that looks up-to-date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y won't win any awards for innovation and performance but on the bright side, it does offer the full smartphone experience within budget. Aimed at the young and novice smartphone users, it focuses on the connectivity and good social skills. The screen resolution and sub-par imaging are the most prominent among the inevitable compromises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the holiday season fast approaching, a smartphone like this one might be right for teens who like to play Angry Birds and chat away on WhatsApp and Facebook. The Galaxy Y is released just in time to have an impact at the busiest shopping time of the year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Galaxy Y is typical for the price range. Next to the USB cable and charger, you'll get a 2 GB MicroSD card with an SD adapter. What's missing is the headphones and it's not the first time Samsung have done this. They needed to cut costs obviously and maybe the idea was to let users buy their headset of choice. It seems to us though that the headphones are an essential accessory. Maybe Galaxy Y buyers could've done without a data cable or a memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is a small handset measuring 104 x 58 x 11.5 mm. At a mere 97.5 g, it's among the lightest droids too. The all-plastic body handles nicely and doesn't raise doubts over durability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The styling of the Samsung Galaxy Y is somewhat bland, perhaps a bit too conservative . The handset is entirely made of plastic, but to be fair, it feels good quality. The textured back is nice to the touch and good at hiding fingerprints, while the front is taken up entirely by the screen and black bezel around it. The phone's tapered edges give a more comfortable hand feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size is comparable to the HTC Wildfire S, which is among the main competitors. There's definitely no trouble carrying the Galaxy Y around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3" capacitive touchscreen has QVGA (240 x 320) resolution and multi-touch support. The screen is pleasingly responsive but the image quality however is below par. It's not just the low resolution - the display has poor viewing angles, low brightness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you'll find a proximity sensor. An ambient light sensor is missing so you?ll have to manually set the brightness to match changing lighting conditions. Even at maximum brightness, sunlight legibility isn't up to scratch. There's no front-mounted camera either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, there is a single hardware button: the central Home key with two capacitive controls either side: Menu and Back. It's the standard Samsung layout. The Home button is set within its own frame, slightly recessed. It has a nice feel to it thanks to the brushed-texture finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the capacitive Menu and Back keys comes on only upon a press. When not used, they're invisible, creating the illusion that there's a single button on the phone. There's no haptic feedback for either the screen or the capacitive keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right of the phone there's only the power/lock button. It?s thin but sufficiently raised with good press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the volume rocker and a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy Y is where the connectivity ports are: a MicroUSB port, hidden under a plastic lid and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole is located at the bottom of the phone, which is where you'll also find the thin slit to put a fingernail in and pull the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2MP camera lens is at the back along with the loudspeaker. There's virtually no scratch or fingerprint protection for the camera lens, while the loudspeaker has a small nub that keeps it from getting completely muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of the Galaxy Y has a textured non-slip finish. It doesn?t quite affect the actual grip but makes the device a little more appealing. The matt finish is fingerprint-proof but the thin grooves might gather dust over time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery is quoted at 850h/540h stand-by (2G/3G respectively) and 17h/6h of talk time. Our unit did quite well actually - one benefit of the small, low-res screen is that it isn't a battery hog. Even at the busiest of testing, the Galaxy Y easily stuck out 2 days on continuous 3G and Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card finds its place under the battery, where it's held by a standard metal hinge. The microSD card can be hot-swapped but you need to remove the back panel to access the slot..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neat and simple, with a bit of style sense, the Samsung Galaxy Y is affordable without looking cheap. It's plastic without feeling feeble. The back panel is nice to the touch, although it could be the wrong color to some. The phone has a good hand fit and is generally very friendly and welcoming. The low screen resolution is the major letdown. No, we're not saying that because we've seen and tested some HD screens lately. The thing is users upgrading from a feature phone will see no upgrade whatsoever in a QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then, even if it doesn?t look its best in QVGA, Android is the bigger part of the deal. That's next on our list, right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Up-to-speed on Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite being on the low end of Android, the Galaxy Y is quite up-to-date with Gingerbread 2.3.5. The topping of choice is Samsung's home-baked TouchWiz launcher and the result is quite good - the low resolution and limited screen estate aside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo that will show you the whole thing in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen displays the current date and time, but the notifications are oddly selective. Incoming emails won't be displayed but missed calls and texts will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the Galaxy Y is unlocked you're greeted by the familiar TouchWiz homescreen. You can have up to seven panes to populate with widgets but you don?t have to use all the screens all the time. If you need less, deleting the extra ones will speed up navigation. You can zoom out with a pinch gesture to enter edit mode, where you can add, remove and rearrange the homescreen panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area gives you various toggles and quick settings - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Sound and Auto rotation of the display. Missed events and download reports get displayed below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button on the homescreen will let you put more content, add/delete homescreen panes or change the wallpaper (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same trick). Live wallpapers are supported too, though there is only one preinstalled and you will have to get the rest from the market. The context menu has shortcuts too for search, notifications and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz task manager is complete with a homescreen widget, which shows the number of currently active apps and saves you the need to install a task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is not available, but you can rearrange icons whichever way you like within the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get down to benchmarks, we hardly need to warn you that this is an entry-level phone. The Galaxy Y is powered by a 830MHz ARMv6 processor and has a total of 290MB of RAM available. These specs are nothing to write home about but the phone is reasonably fast and we were happy with the fluid response of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the usual benchmarks we use aren't compatible with the QVGA resolution, so they are missing here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y will do fine at the routine tasks. Android 2.3.5 OS and the low screen resolution help it run faster and pull an overall acceptable performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung Galaxy Y has unlimited capacity and all the functionality you could want. The application displays contacts stored in the SIM card, your Google account or in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface has been at work in the phonebook bringing some special features. Instead of just flick-scrolling the list of people in the phonebook, you can search the entries by either typing the name of the person in the search box or by using the alphabet scroll at the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y also packs the quick contacts feature, which first appeared on Android 2.1. Using a single click, it lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook to call, text, or email a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have multiple email accounts and sync options include Exchange. There are many other details that you can assign to each entry, such as numbers, email addresses, IM, organization, and more. Clicking the plus sign on the right adds another field of that type, while the minus sign deletes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main contact list view hides some useful shortcuts too. Swiping your finger to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweeping shortcuts are part of the TouchWiz UI and work in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spot on telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y handled calls trouble-free. The reception was consistently good and sound in the earpiece crisp and loud. We didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works beautifully. Tap a digit and it searches both contact numbers and names containing it. If more than one contact is found, a button with a number and an arrow will display the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, which can be filtered to show only certain type of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Y and it got a Below Average score. Keeping this one in a purse or some deep dark pocket can result in missed calls due to an overall quiet speaker. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with Swype<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging application is quite straightforward. It has a new message button and bellow it are all the received messages organized in threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same swiping functionality found in the phonebook has been integrated here as well. A swipe to the left starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application-specific search lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the name or number and choose from the list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap and hold on a message and a context menu brings up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. Once a text is copied you can paste it across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling email can be done either with the standard Gmail app or the generic email app. The Gmail one supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app found on the Galaxy Y is on par with the one on the Galaxy S II but with such a small screen estate you won't be able to go along as fast through texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email application is used for all your other non-gmail email accounts and supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz UI in the Galaxy Y features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y comes with the Samsung home-baked keyboard preinstalled. Despite the smaller screen resolution, this keyboard feels comfortable to type on, what really makes it hard is the low screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you flip the phone on its side, the virtual keyboard automatically switches to the landscape mode, which is much bigger and more comfortable to use. It covers most of the screen however, leaving room for only two lines of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has generously included Swype for an alternative input method. It is a life-saver on the smaller screens (such as the one of the Y) ? you don?t have to be very accurate with your swyping, which makes text input faster and easier. It?s only that, much like with any other text prediction method, it has to support the language you want to enter text in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input us also available and works quite good if you are in quieter environment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vanilla gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y comes with the stock Android gallery. It offers the good ol? functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images - this, however, isn't that insufferable on the Galaxy Y as those 2 MP shots don't really need more pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient ? just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected. Online albums at Picasa show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also organize the photos by date via a button in the top right corner which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also enabled on the Galaxy Y but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player found on the Galaxy Y is plain and simple to use but due to the hardware limitations will not play any DivX or XviD videos, the same goes for over WVGA resolution videos. Anyway this is a simple case of what you get is what you've paid for - the price justifies the limits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in the Samsung Galaxy Y is equipped with the TouchWiz UI as well. You can sort the music using the sorting options which are neatly displayed in a tabbed interface. Among the options are current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen offers an artist cover background and plenty of options. While on a track you can also browse the songs in the same album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music experience on the Galaxy Y can be enhanced thanks to the included equalizer in the settings menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 did fairly well in our audio quality test. It's not the best we have seen, but it certainly does better than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier the smartphone got some really impressive scores with the only average stereo crosstalk being the only exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily the hit that the performance takes when headphones are connected is not too bad - stereo crosstalk spikes and some intermodulation distortion creeps in, but that's about it. Sadly, the volume level in either scenario is quite low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is dreadful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you're the cameraphone freak type move right along - this one isn't worth your time. What you get on the Samsung Galaxy Y is a 2 MP fixed-focus camera that can capture photos in 1600 x 1200 resolution. Not what you'd call exiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrary to the camera's capabilities Samsung has equipped the camera app with the great user interface, which is touch-friendly and has great built-in features such as smile shot, preset scenes on-screen guidelines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the bad stuff - the camera of the Galaxy Y will do only if you're desperately in need of a MMS-quality picture of something and drawing just won't cut it. There's a very low amount of detail, exposure is very bad and often you'll get too dark or way too bright pictures with undistinguishable objects in them and colors are way too dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the samples below to get an idea of the quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still you can't really go all that hard on the Galaxy Y - it's just not meant for a cameraphone. It's in the lowest class of Android and in order to retain a lower price it has to do with setbacks. The occasional MMS is covered with the 2 MP snapper and on such a small screen with such a low resolution the quality doesn't matter all that much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video recording is awful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Samsung Galaxy Y offers video recording too, and as it?s only QVGA at 15fps, we wouldn?t use it for anything other than MMS. The video recorder?s UI looks similar to the camera?s interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched QVGA@15fps sample for direct download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y is ready for worldwide roaming with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity package offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth 3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y doesn?t pack much internal memory (180MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy Y hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing on the cheap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is great for mobile browsing, especially on the latest version of Gingerbread. But on the 3-incher of the low-quality QVGA resolution you'll need a lot of patience to go through a page or read an article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's bookmark list that shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y has the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android market got a facelift<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y has the latest version of the Android Market, featuring a facelift with a bit of WP7 styling. New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor?s Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you?re greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloading an application is done easily and won't require more than a couple of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn?t quite like about the new Android Market layout is that you?ll be forced to do a lot of scrolling if you want to go to a specific category and there isn?t a listed or tabbed menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing capabilities of Android have reached extremely high levels the past couple of years. And as with most Galaxy smartphones, the S5360 Y is equipped with all the necessary apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the calendar app. It has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the home-brewed Notes and My Files apps. The first one has not changed since Galaxy S times and is very comfortable to use - you can scribble notes easily, choose different colors for your notes and more. The My Files application is a file manager that can give you access to the entire file system of your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice recorder is easy to operate and comes preinstalled on the Galaxy Y. You can record as many sound clips as you like and the only limitation is the memory you have on your device. The list tab shows all of your recordings sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is here too and will allow you to view docs hassle free. Editing, however, will require a paid purchase on your part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a calculator, alarm clock, timer, stopwatch and more apps preinstalled on the Galaxy Y. But should you find yourself in need of a new organizing app the Android Market is full of free choices that are excellent for the most part.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>G(PS)oogle maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y packs a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the app of choice and offers the latest touch optimizations like the two finger rotation and tilt, it also features navigation, search for POIs and much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the coolest part of Google Maps is the Street View mode. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps comes complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though (not all countries have the option), and it relies on Internet connection or the uncomfortable map caching (you'll need to go through your entire root to load it up on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Y stands for entry-level phones in the company's recent naming system. Phones for youths and emerging markets. The Galaxy Y is at the bottom of the Android food chain. It joins the likes of the Galaxy Mini, the Gio and the Fit at the wide base of a pyramid that eventually peaks in the next flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a long way from the Galaxy Y to the company's top earners. It will appeal mostly to people who are new to the smartphone market and should rack up strong support for Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android with TouchWiz and the package of preinstalled apps and services offer a more complete mobile experience to people coming from a feature phone. And that's available at a rock-bottom price. No, the Galaxy Y has nothing to offer to experienced smartphone users. It's the experience builder for the next generation of Samsung customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company is taking the entry-level smartphone market seriously. The Galaxy Y joins a lineup of similar handsets. The Galaxy Mini offers a marginally better camera and slightly larger display. The Galaxy Fit boasts a 5 MP camera and bigger screen. However the Galaxy Y does offer the most recent release of Android Gingerbread and a higher-clocked 830Mhz CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Mini ? Samsung Galaxy Fit</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC will rarely go that far down the Android ranks but their Wildfire S could be a major threat. Exactly the same size as the Galaxy Y, it offers far superior build quality, along with a better camera and display. And it isn't that much more expensive than the Galaxy Y.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Wildfire S 3726</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Net is a fairly recent competitor running Gingerbread. It trumps the Galaxy Y with a bigger and better screen, an autofocus still camera and better video. More RAM and a dedicated graphics chip promise fluid handling too, though we're yet to see this one in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus Net</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian is traditionally a place to look for mass-market smartphones. The 1GHz Nokia 500 failed to impress us but an upgrade to Belle could do a lot of good. The traditionally good feature set of Symbian smartphones is a strong point in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Y is the right handset if you're willing to give smartphones a try. There are other options too of course but if you're willing to enter on Samsung's side, the Galaxy Y is the closest and most convenient way in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, in this price range you need to be ready to put up with some limitations. The important thing is you'll be getting the Android experience at a bargain price. And it's a bargain for both sides. Users get a cheap Samsung smartphone. Samsung gets users?well? addicted.</paragraph>
