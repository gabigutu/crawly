			<paragraph>Nokia 5140 is the next model in the Nokia line of phones with enhanced durability. It has well-balanced design and more entertaining functions like compass and video camera, but if you have expected something super new - you will be disappointed - this is still a typical Series 40 phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>On the sandy playground<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The portfolio of Nokia phones is so wide, that it is very easy to get lost in it: so many numbers gathered together is not a quite often seed view. Fortunately, very often the similar models have the same first, and sometimes even the same second number. After reading "5140", it's clear, that this is the heir of the resistant 5100, but for me it's obvious, that it's "grandparent" is Nokia 5210. All these telephones have been tested in hard conditions, specially selected for them by young people of active and dynamically changing lifestyle - sauna, mud and football field, vacation in the forest, or sand on the beach.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>None of the mentioned phones is prepared for extremely severe conditions, such as mines, building construction, steel foundry, but small rain drops, a sudden fall, swimming in a lake with it, or exposure in a dusty environment, will not be of a great harm for the phones. All the three models have unique two-part construction - their two component shell consist of up and down cover - when you press the opening button - first the down cover will be removed and later the upper one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   The phone shells are available in 2 colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The protection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although the cover looks water-resistant, don't count on this too much. Describing the durability of 5140, Nokia uses the statement "protection against splashes and dust" and this is about the level of protection the phone has indeed. In the upper part you can find the slot for a handsfree device, the speaker and the flashlight. It is possible that a small quantity of water could penetrate through these slots, but it will not harm the phone because the electronic parts are isolated by blocking rubber cover, which does not allow water to get inside the phone. The speaker and the display are tightly bordered with a rubber cover. Therefore, it might not be a problem if you swim with the phone from time to time, but it is not recommended. Very interesting designed carrying straps which keep the telephone in an upside-down position are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The phone is rather heavy at first sight, but it has stylish sport appearance and smart design with rugged shells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Interesting carrying strip is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is hidden in water-resistant jacket under the down shell. It is not freely attached, like it is in some other models of Nokia - it is protected by a thin rubber jacket, which prevents from penetrating water inside the phone, if some could get under the shells anyway. If you remove the jacket using your nail, you can take the battery out. Once charged it endures in a standby mode up to 5 days and it will take you 2 hours to recharge it. The jack for recharging is under a rubber strip and next to it is situated the system Pop-Port connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The shell can be easily removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery is hidden in a water-resist cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The telephone shells are produced from semi-transparent material, which is available in several shades. The sides of the shells are rubber, so that this protects the phone against splashes and scratching. Nail, hard subject, keys in the pocket will cannot harm. When the shell of the phone is damaged, you can easily change it with another one. It is very difficult to break the shell - I have made several crash tests and it turned out to be very resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; In the upper part of the phone is the flashlight and in the down part are situated the connecting jacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The digital compass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you come across Nokia 5140, your attention undoubtedly will be drawn at two features: the bubble level in the top left of the phone which main function is to calibrate the compass. Read carefully! - A classical compass, which shows the directions of the world, not only graphically, with a compass rose, but numerically in degrees (e.g. 350 N), so that you can adjust the direction, you want to hold, in degrees and the compass will not allow you to lost your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;One of the phone "miracles" - the compass calibrator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I calibrate the compass North is always behind me.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the compass, for out-door functions may be considered flashlight, which was available in models 5100 and 1100. You will find it very useful when you drop your keys in the dark for example. The thermometer is also very handy, which, by the way is not the very paragon of accuracy. In arias, where the temperature was approximately 20 C, it used to show between 22 C and 27 C; it seems that the accuracy of the thermometer depends on how close is the phone to the body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;In the upper right corner of the display you can see the temperature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Make some noise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last, and to some extend uncommon function for an out-door usage is the Sound Meter (Decibel meter). Its usage is a bit contradictory, but at least it will give you a chance to realize how noisy is the environment, you live in. Please imagine the following situation: before falling asleep in the tent, you set your decibel meter to alarm you, if the noise goes over 70 decibels. If a thief or a bear is approaching your tent - your Nokia 5140 will give you a sign. Of course this is only in my imagination, but you might think of more probable scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Shout out loud in order to test it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In comparison to Nokia 5100 - the keyboard of Nokia 5140 is considerably softer. You can fell as if you were touching a jelly while writing. We've heard many complaints about how hard is to use the keyboard of 5100, so this might be a welcome change for many of the users. The button "Menu" is situated higher and is harder. The same can be said about the "green" and the "red" receiver buttons - they are situated higher than the other buttons, and they are harder. The five-way scroll helps you to use your phone considerably faster and easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; The keyboard is extremely soft, which makes the writing very easy ? You can explore your phone much easier using the five-way scroll ? The display lights strongly, but the light does not spread uniformly</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A so-so display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The passive display does not deserve superlatives. Like all the rest Series 40 phones, it has a 128 x 128 pixels resolution, which nowadays is not a great achievement. The CSTN display with 4096 colors used in Nokia 5140 is rather outdated now; Samsung for example uses better displays even on its entry level models. On such small surface you can read an 8 - line SMS, but you will really need a magnifier to see the letters, because they are very small. Of course, you can zoom out the letters, but then you will have only 5 lines shown at a time on the display. Not only the size, the quality of the display also does not provide the expected satisfaction. The light is not white - the color is more like autumn leaves. When comparing the Nokia 5140 display with the active display of Nokia 6230, which I use now, the difference is apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia should really consider using better displays in their Series 40 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating the Nokia 5140 menu felt quite slow. While testing the phone I had to wait longer than I was willing to. The hardest thing to me was surfing in the Photo Gallery, at some point I was losing my patience. Yeah, I know that it is a distinguishing feature of the cheaper Series 40 models, but the rivals do not sleep. When, I took in my arms Nokia 6230, after testing Nokia 5140 for so long time I had the feeling that it is lightning fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;The resolution and the contrast of the display are not very good, and the dark wallpaper behind does not help a lot ? The icons are small and not self explanatory</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation of this model is not very successful, the icons are not very attractive and unintuitive. Very often you cannot understand for which function an icon sands for, while, when using Nokia 6230, I use the images without any troubles - one icon - full-screen image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where are the differences?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you compare the Nokia 5140 to the older model Nokia 5100 you will draw a very interesting conclusion. The weigh, the dimensions, the talk time and standby time of the battery, and the other technical data are almost the same, both phones use the same 4096 colors display. All the standard functions are the same, like for all the other Series 40 models: phonebook, MMS, calendar, settings etc., so I will pay attention mostly to the improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard functions are typical for the Series 40 models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one small improvement in the phonebook - if you could entry only 300 contacts in Nokia 5100, now in 5140 the number of the entries is increased to 500. All the other functions are the same - a lot of fields per record, etc. A nice surprise for me was the fact, that you can use MIDI melodies with a good quality, so that if you have some MIDI songs on your PC, you can transfer them in your phone using the infrared port. If you don't like the standard melodies, you can delete them from the memory and replace them with your favorites. If you often use the handsfree, you will need an automatic volume control, which is not available on the predecessor Nokia 5100.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another new feature in comparison to Nokia 5100 is the integrated POP3/SMTP email client, which is a Java application. Its abilities are similar with the abilities, available in other Nokia models, like 6820, 6230 and 6220 - basic functionality, the email attachments are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer functions are also typical for Series 40. There is an alarm clock; you can use the radio or the handsfree to wake you up, but the option "snooze" is not available. The alarm clock works even when the phone is switched off. Another feature is the voice recorder, which can record for up to 3 min at an entry, but the total duration of all voice records is limited only by the available memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm clock ? setting the allarm clock ? Voice recorder </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It lights and it takes pictures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated camera is something really new for a rugged phone. The camera shots video with sound and when it's dark the flashlight can be used; the duration of a single video record is 18 seconds. Once the unforgettable moment is recorded it can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;The mobile phone can shoot pictures and record video clips with total time of up to 18 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the integrated camera is neither any worse, nor any better in comparison to other models with VGA camera. I like the fact, that the color balance is accurate; the camera saves the colors the same as they are indeed. The functions of the camera are digital zoom, night mode, color, resolution, automatic close of the cover. The images can be sent by infrared port, cable or MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outdoor photos are quite good; the photos taken indoor sometimes are too dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Almost a Walkie Talkie<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The technology Push To Talk is one of the latest innovations in the communication industry and Nokia 5140 is one of the first phones with Push To Talk support. It gives you the opportunity to use your phone like a Walkie Talkie. Unfortunately it works only if the operator supports this function and if the service is enabled. Push To Talk is really good and not only entertaining function. It could be used, for example, when the boss wants to talk at a time with more than one of his/her employees. Unfortunately this service is not free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Push To Talk menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5140 is a very good choice to access the Internet. The phone offers you the fastest available GPRS speed - Class 10 - 4 timeslots for download and 2 timeslots for upload. If your network supports EDGE you can browse at even higher speeds - up to 177 kBps. To connect the Nokia 5140 as a modem to your computer or PDA you have to use infrared port or cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One other improvement, comparing to the predecessor Nokia 5100 is the increased amount of the internal memory - from 725 KB to 4 MB. You will find it very handy if you like to use the camera often, or if you want to have a picture for every person in your phonebook. For Java you will have 2 MB of available memory, while every single application must not exceed 128 KB - this is not a problem, because bigger applications cannot be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;The memory stores a good amount of images, sounds and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5140 will find its place<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5140 is a very well equipped phone, and as a whole it has more functions than Nokia 6610i, for example. Its extra-rugged construction is an advantage, but undoubtedly one can find phones of smaller dimensions. The keyboard with soft buttons could be considered rather a disadvantage, the display could be better; the requests of the clients are not completely satisfied. Personally I do not have any other remarks regarding this Series 40 model, equipped with a more resistant shell from the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pros and cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>+ Enhanced durability + Integrated compass, thermometer, Decibel meter + VGA camera with good color balance + EDGE and Push To Talk support  - Outdated 4K color display - Not very comfortable keyboard (a problem with the most of the rugged phones) - Slow menu navigation</paragraph>
