			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy S6 vs. Galaxy S5 vs. Galaxy Note 4 blind camera test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Welcome to the Galaxy blind camera test! We have Samsung's most recent flagships - in order of release the Galaxy S5, the Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy S6 - and we want to see how much Samsung cameras have progressed in the eyes of users before we publish our own test findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: voting is now closed! Which phone hides behind which letter is revealed on Page 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped several photos and a video, but we're only providing you with a small part of each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not giving away the order in which the phones appear in the crops below, but each has been assigned a unique letter throughout this test. And we are not asking you to guess which image belongs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, we'd like you to vote for the image that you like best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of daylight shots to start off. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a Samsung ISOCELL sensor, while the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S6 use a Sony IMX240, all three sensors offer 16MP resolution in a widescreen aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vote for your favorites below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, is a photo taken after sundown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we cropped a still frame taken out of 2160p videos shot with the three phones. There's something going on with the color rendering, is it getting better though?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mathematically, all 3,840 x 2,160px videos are the same. But in reality different phones have their strengths and weaknesses, which one do you like the best?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have about 24 hours to vote, we'll tally the score and let you know which Galaxy camera came out on top tomorrow. We're also working on a shootout between these three, plus the iPhone 6 so stand by for our thoughts on the image quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Blind test: the reveal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time to tally the votes - you, our readers, have had 24 hours to pick their favorite Samsung Galaxy cameraphone based on scanty crops of daylight and low-light photos, plus one for video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results are roughly what we expected them, though the Galaxy S5 got more votes than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly sharper photos of the Galaxy Note 4 won it the victory in broad daylight, while the wider aperture and more laid back processing allowed the Galaxy S6 to snag a victory in the dark. The Note 4 also came out on top for video, which we suspect has something to do with the color rendering and the extra sharpening. The Galaxy S6 still won out over its predecessor, the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you can have a second look at the crops, this time with the real names overlaid on top.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can expect our dedicated Galaxy camera shootout tomorrow.</paragraph>
