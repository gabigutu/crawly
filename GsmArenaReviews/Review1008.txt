			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Two flagship smartphones carrying such a weight of expectations that one would think they'd have no time and energy to worry about each other. The Samsung Galaxy S4 has to outsell the Galaxy S III and the HTC One is expected to turn the fortunes around for an ailing company. So, which one's bigger? And we mean the job, not the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two contenders themselves will have an entire review to each prove their point. These two superdroids make no compromise and charge big bucks. They need to make sure users are getting their money's worth. That's what flagships are all about. They win big but they lose big too - and last season Samsung and HTC were on either side of that line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things look different this time around. We know the two phones quite well already, the HTC One review is only just behind us, and the Galaxy S4's in the final stages. The setting for this clash has changed too - the elite flagship club isn't exclusive to top-tier manufacturers anymore. Yet, there should be no better guarantee for a thriller than the names of Samsung and HTC. The prodigy children of two of the most revered Android makers are about to fight it out, and even the slightest edge could give a massive advantage in the marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running over the entire spec sheet of each phone will take too long - both droids are impressively armed - so instead we'll just list the differences. Here's how one is better than the other and vice versa.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One over Samsung Galaxy S4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the two lists above, you'd thing the Samsung Galaxy S4 has the upper hand. It's not that simple - not all bullet points have the same weight. For example, we'll take the sleek aluminum unibody over a hygroscope any day of the week. And the megapixel debate for the two cameras will probably take a huge chunk of this article to resolve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's look at the schools of thought behind the two phones. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is the power user's heaven with settings, tweaks and toggles scattered all over the place - with all the proper hardware support too. TouchWiz is familiar and intuitive enough so regular users will not be lost, but they might miss out on some of the more exotic features of the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is quite the opposite - it aims to make things simple. Zoe looks impressive, but require nothing of the user, it's all done automagically. The Optical Image Stabilization and Beats Audio similarly work behind the scenes to enhance the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's take this one step at a time. Just one important note before we let the HTC One and the Galaxy S4 off the leash. The Samsung flagship in this shootout is the I9505 version, the one powered by a Snapdragon 600.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung and HTC set out on different paths from the very drawing board. Samsung focused on sensible finish and practical build, while HTC wanted a design that makes a statement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Samsung Galaxy S4 uses a plastic body with a Hyperglaze finish just like that of its predecessor. Taking after a design that wasn't too widely loved in the first place is a bit of a turnoff to be honest, but the slimmer waistline and thinner bezels still make the Galaxy S4 look much better than its predecessor (which is larger, despite the smaller screen). The Galaxy S4 is actually more compact than the HTC One as well, but the difference is negligible - at least until you account for the fact that the Samsung fits a bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic build has a number of practical advantages - it's lighter for one, 20g, and the removable back cover means a user-replaceable battery and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC developed a complicated process of carving the One out of a block of aluminum and the result is arguably the best looking smartphone to date. The phone is a bit thicker than the Galaxy S4, but the curve of the back hides that very well. The extra weight and the aluminum finish give the HTC One a premium feel that really puts its competitor today to shame, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you don't care about the exact numbers, the differences you're likely to notice are that the Galaxy S4 is thinner, lighter and has a bigger screen compared to the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, a 4.7" screen was a conscious choice by HTC (as something more manageable) and the front-facing stereo speakers are a great touch. We're not sure about removing the third button though, whether it's Menu or App switcher, physical or on-screen, a third button is practically expected out of Android phones. The duties of the missing task switcher key on the One have been taken over by the home key, but that's its third function and that makes it a bit unintuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an IR emitter on the top, both phones can control appliances at home - TVs, set-tops, air conditioners and so on. On the HTC One, the emitter is built into the Power/Lock key, which isn't a problem, but the button itself is small and flush against the surface, making it difficult to use. The volume rocker isn't much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung kept the IR emitter separate on the Galaxy S4 and put the Power/Lock key in the traditional spot on the right, which benefits single-handed use. It helps that the button is properly raised too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. This is by no means a goalless draw, though - From a pure design standpoint, the HTC One wipes the floor with the Samsung Galaxy S4. The One is the phone to be seen with, it looks more expensive if you will. The Galaxy S4 on the other hand is deliberately underplaying the looks - as if to say that what matters is on the inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the Samsung Galaxy S4 hardware is that the smartphone is more compact while offering a bigger screen and a larger battery. But it just looks boring, a minor update of the Galaxy S III design, which we didn't love in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One on the other hand looks and feels great. With 32GB of built-in storage (there's a 64GB version too), we didn't miss the microSD card slot much either. The speakers are definitely a plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, a card slot (more than just memory expansion) and a removable battery (easy to throw in a spare, or replace a defective unit) are important to many users and help the Samsung Galaxy S4 clinch a hard-fought draw.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>2013 is the year of the 1080p Android flagships and the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One are two of the most prominent members. The Galaxy S4 goes for a bigger 5" Super AMOLED screen, while the One sports a smaller 4.7" Super LCD3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel densities of both are ridiculously high (441ppi for the S4, 469ppi for the One), but honestly anything over 400ppi looks the same. One thing is for sure though, there is a difference between the 400+ppi screens and the 300+ppi screens of the last generation, though it's not a Retina-scale revolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it should be noted that the Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S4 uses a PenTile matrix, which means there are fewer sub-pixels in total (two per pixel instead of three). The high pixel density and the odd arrangement of the subpixels does a great job at hiding that, though. So, while the 306ppi Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S III showed some jaggies up close, this one doesn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One screens up close</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many people complain about the oversaturated colors of AMOLED screens (while others prefer them), but Samsung quells such complaints with the special Adobe RGB mode for the display, which greatly improves color accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent viewing angles and contrast are typical advantages of AMOLEDs and the Galaxy S4 screen is a great example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One's screen on the other hand is very much in the running for the best LCD - it has great colors and impressive contrast and viewing angles. There's a slight contrast loss at very wide angles, but you'll probably never notice. Black levels are good and the maximum brightness goes up pretty high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the One runs into a problem is sunlight legibility - it's good, but not great. It's comparable to that of a Sony Xperia Z and noticeably better than that of the HTC Butterfly. However, the Galaxy S4 screen is just less reflective, giving it better sunlight legibility even if the maximum brightness is lower.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One nice thing about having Android 4.2 and an AMOLED screen is that you can download a Daydream for the Galaxy S4 that shows a simple clock on a black background and you can run this overnight without losing too much battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Samsung flagship takes this one, as its screen is bigger, with better sunlight legibility, while still offering you the option to have accurate colors thanks to Adobe RGB mode. The HTC One screen is impressive, too, but the higher pixel density can't really make up for the lower native contrast and slightly inferior sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It doesn't matter how cool the screen is or how powerful the processor is if your battery is dead. Both phones pack batteries of over 2,000mAh and a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, which usually means efficient standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a slight advantage in battery capacity - 2,600mAh over 2,300mAh - but its chipset is overclocked so we'll see how that balances out. Also, the screen types will make a difference, LCD usually does well on the web browsing test, while AMOLED typically does better in the video test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 10: We ran a new battery test on the Samung Galaxy S4 and updated this page with the results. While before the update, the S4 and HTC One were matched in talk time, now the S4 jumps 4 hours ahead. It's among the longest lasting phones when it comes to talking. The HTC One is pretty good too - we doubt anyone will talk for over 13 hours on a single charge - but the S4 will give you more talk time if you forgot to charge the battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One topped our web browsing chart by beating the Apple iPhone 5 by a hair. It's also the top droid in this test by about 50 minutes. The Galaxy S4 lagged behind in this test by about an hour, but after the update the gap got even bigger. The One can last nearly an hour and forty minutes longer, which is a significant win.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At video playback, both phones do very well with times just over 10 hours. Pre-update, the Galaxy S4 had a small advantage (15 minutes or so), but after the update it added 2 hours and 15 minutes to that lead. The HTC One shows a good improvement over the Butterfly (up by an hour and a half), while the Galaxy S4 climed closer to the top (and beat its predecessor, which had a smaller, lower-res screen, by a nice margin).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We crunched the numbers and calculated an overall battery rating of 69 hours for the Samsung Galaxy S4. The HTC One scored just 48 hours. That number shows how long a full battery charge will last if you do an hour of calls, web browsing and watch an hour of video each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the individual tests, the Galaxy S4 beat the HTC One in two out of three by several hours, but crucially lost the web browsing test. We suspect users do more web browsing than watching videos, so that one loss keeps the S4 from total domination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, the Galaxy S4 has plenty of juice for browsing throughout the day and savings in the other categories will allow it to stay ahead of the HTC One in a mixed usage scenario (no one uses their phone just for browsing). The relatively low standby power usage of the S4 means that lighter users will go longer with the S4 (which loses less charge during the night). Keep in mind too that the battery is easily accessible and Samsung will be selling a dedicated charger for a spare battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the HTC One might appeal to heavy browsers, especially if they lower the brightness at less than 50% (the One screen is brighter than that of the Galaxy S4).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. After the update the gap between the two phones widened in favor of the S4. The HTC One offers good battery life too, but you'll have to charge it more often than the S4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Interface - TouchWiz vs. Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One run Android Jelly Bean, but there are considerable differences. For one, the Samsung smartphone launches with 4.2.2 and the One has 4.1.2. The custom skins used are quite different too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's skin, TouchWiz, tries to stay relatively close to Android (the latest version more than ever), but piles on an impressive list of exclusive features that the Korean company developed for its flagship devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's skin, Sense, goes for its own look and a number of exclusive features. The amount of home-backed apps is smaller compared to TouchWiz, but the experience is farther from stock Android compared to the Galaxy S4. It even goes as far as to offer two-button navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 gets certain benefits from running the latest version of Android, specifically the lockscreen widgets and the notification area toggles. Of course, Samsung has tweaked both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the lockscreen, the right side pane, which normally launches the camera, is set to Favorite Apps by default (you can switch it back to being a camera launcher). Also, the images on the screen are randomly selected photos of beautiful travel locations pulled straight from TripAdvisor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area shows a row of toggles, a brightness slider and, of course, the actual notifications. There's a whole grid of toggles, and the top row is always visible. The full grid is revealed either by tapping on a button or by a two-finger swipe (similar to stock Android), but you can also just swipe the row horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider can be hidden to save space and it has an Auto toggle. In Auto mode, it lets you tweak the automatic brightness algorithm, making the display brighter or dimmer than its ambient light sensor will suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen on TouchWiz is pretty standard with only the Overview mode standing out as an addition to stock Android. We do like the small thumbnails that guide you when adding a new widget, they show the widget silhouettes, making it easier to find an open spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One on the other hand sticks to the familiar Sense lockscreen with four shortcuts and time and weather info. There're a couple of different lockscreens available - Productivity (shows messages and calendar events), Photo album, Music and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been stripped of the additions seen in previous Sense UI versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is quite different though - the leftmost pane is entirely occupied by BlinkFeed, an event stream that combines updates from your social networking accounts with news sources to bring you relevant information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the homescreen panes are the usual deal. You can set any of them as the default pane if you don't like BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has got rid of the Menu button and uses only two - Back and Home. But they don't quite work as you would expect, to get to the app switcher you double tap the Home key, a long press launches Google Now. The app switcher has been changed too, it shows a 3 x 3 grid of apps that you can dismiss by swiping up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu key is no longer part of Android, most apps use an on-screen button. Sense has an alternative, a swipe down that reveals a row of options. It's non-standard and third-party apps that require a Menu button will show a row at the bottom with an on-screen Menu button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't argue which interface is better - it's a matter of personal preference, launchers and lockscreens are easy to change in Android. But the Galaxy S4 has a number of exclusive TouchWiz features over stock Android and the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest one is obviously Multi-window - it allows for two supported apps to run simultaneously, sharing the screen. How the apps split the screen can be adjusted as desired. Not all apps support it, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing is Air View - the Galaxy S4 can detect your finger hovering over the screen and works similarly to the S Pen on the Galaxy Note II. It can preview info like the full text of messages and calendar appointments, give you a peek inside folders with images and preview what's ahead in the timeline of a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are Air Gestures. A dedicated IR sensor above the screen can detect the direction of your hand waving over the device from several inches and serve to scroll web pages, change tracks and answer calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Screen options are interesting too, they make sure the screen is rotated correctly (the accelerometer-based rotate gets it wrong if you're lying on your side), that the screen doesn't turn off while you're watching (or reading) and that the video will pause automatically when you look away and resume when you get back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice is also on board and while some of the functionality partially doubles that of Google's Voice Search, it can do more. It has a nice Car mode too, which simplifies the UI and makes the font bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Samsung smartphone comes with a newer version of Android that, while skinned, feels closer to stock Android. It has more flexibility too with many interesting features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 5.0 is the best looking Sense yet, but HTC's experiments (BlinkFeed, only two buttons, etc.) will rub some people the wrong way. The lack of connectivity toggles is a bit too hard to forgive in 2013, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung and HTC have spruced up the stock Android apps in different ways. The music player in particular will be an interesting comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC continues its partnership with Beats (which it co-owns) and the music player features the Beats audio enhancement (in fact that's the only one, there's no custom equalizer). The results are pretty amazing with some of the best audio output yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also automatically grabs album art from Grace Note (can be set to only work over Wi-Fi) and can show fancy visualizations complete with karaoke-style lyrics. Having stereo loudspeakers on the front is a nice perk too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's SoundHound integration too, if you need song recognition and there's a built-in FM radio receiver, which gives it an edge over the Galaxt S4 (it's still an important feature to some).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 relies on SoundAlive and My Sound. The latter helps you calibrate the player to match your headset by asking you to listen to a series of tones and determining the low and high frequencies the headset can reproduce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice setting is Auto Volume, which normalizes the volume between tracks (can be very useful when you have a mix from multiple albums and artists from different sources).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One interesting option - albeit with limited application - is Group Play. It uses a local Wi-Fi connection to group multiple phones together. That means you can play a track through the loudspeakers of all of them simultaneously, but also do other cool things like multiplayer games and shared display of documents. Only certain Samsung phones will get this feature though, so good luck trying it any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia battle continues with TV output. Both have wireless TV-Out over Miracast and can use MHL dongles for wired output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4, however, has much better video codec support out of the box, playing any file we threw at it, including subtitles. It has a pop up mode that shows the video in a small floating window. The dedicated Video app shows multiple videos playing simultaneously, a nice preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One cannot play MKV or DivX files (but works with XviD) and had some issues with audio codecs like AC3. It does have subtitle support built in, but you might want to head to the Play Store and pick up a more capable player for free, the Snapdragon 600 chipset will handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're on the subject, we should remind you that both phones feature IR emitters and can control equipment at home - that includes TVs, your AV receiver, a projector, even air conditioners. Both can be at the heart of a cool home theater setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One has Zoe - a powerful gallery that works with the advanced camera functionality for some cool effects. One of the best is Zoe Highlights - if you're shooting in Zoe mode, the camera will record 3 seconds of video with each photo you take and will alter assemble them on a video reel. It also allows for cool post-processing and image editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has cool image effects, but most of them have to be enabled at the time of shooting. There's a Story Album app, which automatically groups photos based on the time they were taken and the location, but it does nothing more than a collage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 also has a number of other apps like S Health (fitness and diet tracking), a translator (for text and audio) and Samsung's ChatOn service that allows for simple text chats, but also video calls (with two people at the same time) and screen sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Takes pride in its Transfer content feature that allows you to easily pull the contacts off your old phone and onto the One. This includes reading an iPhone backup file to extract the relevant info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. We'd say this one is even since both phones are close on the important features and any holes can easily be filled with apps from the Play Store. The Samsung Galaxy S4 does have more as far as numbers go, but some of them have very limited application so they don't count. The HTC One instead sets itself apart with a few - and handy - features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: We re-ran the loudspeaker with a different Galaxy S4 unit, which performed a bit better in the Voice section of the test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested the loudspeakers of the two handsets. Neither is exceptionally loud, both scoring a Good mark. Still, the One has the advantage of stereo sound directed at you while watching videos and playing games and it the speakers don't get muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. The Galaxy S4 is a tad louder, but the HTC One takes this one with well-positioned stereo speakers and far nicer sound in general.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones did greatly in our dedicated audio quality test. Last week when we reviewed the HTC One we found it to have the best audio output of any smartphone we have tested over the past few years, but the Samsung Galaxy S4 didn't go down without a fight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, we were shocked to find out that the Samsung flagship had a cleaner output than the HTC smartphone. While both are perfect when attached to an active external amplifier, the Galaxy S4 remained just as great when we plugged in a pair of headphones, while the HTC One took a hit to its stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's a difference that's very hard to detect without lab equipment, so for purposes practical the two are on par. What is not so hard to hear is the difference in volume levels - the HTC One is notably louder than the Samsung Galaxy S4 in both test scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S4 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. The extra high volume levels of the HTC flagshipp helped it to the victory in this incredibly close contest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, May 9: We added the Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 to the benchmarks, this is the one powered by Exynos 5 Octa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qualcomm must be feeling pretty good - the HTC One and the majority of Samsung Galaxy S4 units (plus flagships from other companies) use the company's Snapdragon 600 chipset. This means we can expect similar benchmark scores, with a slight advantage for the Galaxy S4 due to the higher clock speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 600 chipset packs four Krait 300 cores, which are clocked at 1.7GHz in the HTC One and 1.9GHz in the Galaxy S4. There's also 2GB of RAM and an Adreno 320 GPU on both smartphones. The GPU clock speed is unknown but we suspect it's higher in the S4 than the One. Then there's the other Galaxy S4, the I9500, which uses an Exynos 5 Octa with four Cortex-A15 cores at 1.6GHz (the Cortex-A7 will shut off under the heavy load of the benchmarks), 2GB of RAM and PowerVR SGX544.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first batch of benchmarks tests CPU performance - first of a single core (Benchmark Pi) and then the full multithreaded performance (Linpack and Geekbench). The Galaxy S4 narrowly takes the single-threaded performance and gets a more comfortable lead in the multi-threaded tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant are all-inclusive tests that gauge pretty much every component (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc.). Both of them place the Samsung Galaxy S4 ahead of the HTC One by a narrow margin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With mobile phone screens topping FullHD resolution, GPUs are under more stress than ever. Luckily for the Galaxy S4 and HTC One, the Adreno 320 is one of the fastest around. The PowerVR SGX544MP3 is also blazing fast, it's used in the Apple iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GLBenchmark 2.7 test runs at 1080p resolution off-screen, meaning the actual resolution of the physical screen doesn't matter, so we can compare raw performance. The Galaxy S4 tops the charts here, beating the HTC One by good 4-6fps. The only mobile GPU we've tested yet is that in the Apple iPad 4, but that's a tablet and it's not a fair comparison really.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel is a tech demo for the latest Unreal Engine, which is bound to see use in real world games. We ran the test in full resolution with performance set to quality. The Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One came very close in this test as both often hit the software limit of 60fps. Still, it indicates that both phones will run heavy games easily.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. Samsung clocked the Snapdragon 600 chipset higher than HTC and helped its flagship to the victory here. The Exynos 5 Octa version of the Galaxy S4 is slightly faster with its Cortex-A15 CPU, but there's very little difference between the I9500 and I9505 in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is by no means a slouch - we doubt there will be apps or games that are too intensive for it anytime soon as that would mean they won't run on anything other than flagship phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One take a very different approach to photography. The One tries to be different with a special sensor with big pixels and a dedicated image processing chip, while the Galaxy S4 sticks to the traditional formula of a high-res camera and mature software processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we talk camera features though, we should cover the camera interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 camera interface builds on the Galaxy Camera UI. Its most advanced features are available on a carousel with descriptive images and text and once you're used to them you can switch to a grid, so each shooting mode is only a couple of taps away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color effects are hidden at the bottom of the screen and they all get a simultaneous live preview to help you choose. Additional settings are available in the upper left, though you'd rarely use those. We're not very happy about Samsung unifying the still and video camera UIs though - if you're shooting 4:3 photos (which you should if you want the full 13MP resolution), you have to frame your videos on a 4:3 viewfinder that expands to 16:9 only after you hit record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One camera interface relies on a single long list of menu items and sub items to select scenes and modes and settings for both stills and videos. It's not nearly as streamlined and you'll have to scroll to find the option you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But HTC is banking on the Zoe feature set, which does get a dedicated button and so do color effects. The camera has a unified interface for stills and videos too, but since the sensor itself has a 16:9 aspect ratio it's not a problem really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool thing about the Galaxy S4 UI is that it allows you to set the role of the volume rocker - it can be a still camera shutter key, video camera shutter key or zoom lever. Both the Galaxy S4 and the One skip the lockscreen when you hit the Power/Lock key (or Home key on the S4) if the currently running app is the camera, which is great for shooting sprees.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras have a long list of features with the Galaxy S4 having more, while the One is tidier as most features are concentrated into Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 has a number of useful shooting modes - there's HDR, of course, panorama and 360 photo (Photo Sphere), plus object removal, cinemagrams and Sound &amp; shot (still image plus background audio from the scene). The dual-shot mode is pretty sweet as it solves the problem of who gets left out of the group photo (or video).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One doesn't have an answer to 360 photo or dual-shot but it does have its advantages. The Zoe Highlights for one are pretty awesome and give you much more than the combination of cinemagrams and Sound &amp; shot can.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, with Zoe you don't have to choose - you can get the animation, the sound, do object removal, do Sequence shot (which Samsung calls Drama shot) and so on, while with the Galaxy S4 these modes are separate and you have to choose which one you want while capturing the image. You can't go back and edit it like you can with Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another advantage of Zoe is that it's fairly easy to share - you get your still photo and the 3 second video that was recorded as separate files and you can upload the Highlight to Zoe Share and sent the link to your friends. The site relies on Flash though, so viewing it on a mobile device might be problematic. Also, each Zoe shot takes 3 seconds if you want usable video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy S4 you can have a low-quality GIF (only if you shot in Cine photo mode) rather than a 1080p video, you can't really share Sound &amp; shot photos (only the static image gets sent, the audio is dropped).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One isn't done - it has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which combined with its big "UltraPixels" should translate to better low-light performance. We'll test that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OIS also means smoother video, here's how the One stabilization stacks up against the Galaxy S4's digital image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to mention here is the camera speed - for regular shots both phones are blazing fast. However, the Samsung Galaxy S4 takes longer when doing special shots like HDR or Night Mode compared to the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. Both phones have a lot going for them, but we're willing to rule in favor of the HTC One. It makes it very easy to make a cool collection of shots with Zoe and Highlights, with easy editing after the shot and easy sharing. It's also faster when taking pictures, especially when in a special mode. And the OIS is awesome to have no matter what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 does win out on a sheer number of features and we like the simplicity of the carousel interface. Ywt most people will be shooting in auto mode and might not even see all these features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: HTC and Samsung both issued updates that tweaked the camera software on their flagships, so we took new samples, made new crops and updated this article accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we took both phones and shot several camera samples with each. We've prepared various crops to highlight the differences in image quality and we've included the full-resolution shots if you want to make your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, let's talk Field of View (FoV) - how much can you fit in the frame with each camera. According to EXIF info, the HTC One camera is a 28mm (in 35mm equiv.) wide-angle camera, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 is narrower at 31mm. It's noticeably narrower than the Galaxy S III too, here's an illustration of the FoV of the three phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk resolution - the Galaxy S4 boasts 13MP while the One only 4MP. The pixels, sorry, UltraPixels on the One are bigger, so per-pixel detail should be better. For the first couple of crops, we upscaled HTC One photos to 13MP, which is the fair way of comparing amount of resolved detail (downscaling reduces detail).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the difference is night and day. There's just not enough resolution in HTC One photos for fine detail and the high amount of noise sure doesn't help. Also defects like over-sharpening halos and purple fringing become pretty obvious. The contrast is punched up a bit too high, and colors are off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: HTC managed to reduce the noise level in HTC One photos, which in turn improved the detail. Still, there is some noise and the oversharpening halos remain though they've been reduced since the update. The Samsung Galaxy S4 also shows an oversharpening halo, but less noise. Color accuracy goes in favor of the One with the S4 preferring the slightly oversaturated look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 captures far more detail (see bricks, wall texture, foliage) and the noise level is relatively low (check the sky). It shows over-sharpening too, but no purple fringing and better color accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: The difference in fine detail remains strongly in favor of the Galaxy S4. There's noticeable noise in the sky in the HTC One photo, which can be seen even without upscaling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While upscaling is the fairer way to compare fine detail, downscaling is probably the more common scenario (a FullHD TV, for example, has only 2MP resolution and most photos you share on social networks get downsampled). So we tried downscaling the Galaxy S4 photos to 4MP to see what that does. Note that the higher resolution of the Samsung S4 lets you crop the photo, while cropping an HTC One photo runs the risk of going below 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, this comparison isn't favorable for the One either. The fine detail just isn't there and there's noticeable noise, despite the large pixels. The Galaxy S4 photos see the noise level drop further and are far sharper overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: After the update, the HTC One managed to retain more fine detail, which got it closer to the detail in the downscaled Galaxy S4 photo. The image is still not as sharp, but it's a noticeable improvement from the Taiwanese company. Unfortunately, the phone messed up the white balance, which gave the image a blueish tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: Here are the camera samples used to make the crops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some photos have bright highlights and dark shadows, which is where the HDR mode kicks in. We snapped photos with HDR both off and on with the two phones. Here's a crop of the images. Note that the Galaxy S4 photos were downscaled to 4MP as we're looking at dynamic range rather than fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 HDR mode takes a while to process the image but it yields great results. It mostly brings out detail in the highlights and gives shadows a slight boost. The HTC One is faster but did almost nothing for the shadows and more often than not ruined the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 7: After the update, the HTC One HDR mode does much better in bringing out detail in the shadows, but still spoils the highlights a bit. The S4 situation is similar with better results in the shadows. Note that both phones changed their color rendering with HDR mode on, which lead to some loss in color detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 10: We also tried out the sweep panorama modes. The Galaxy S4 produced the higher resolution shot (a whopping 60MP image) and it shows only minor stitching problems. The HTC One did a slightly better job at stitching, but its panorama had pretty low resolution (only 10MP) and there's noticeable purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones captured about 360 degrees (the Galaxy S4 actually goes a little further) and did well considering this is about as difficult as sweep panoramas go with near and far objects and well-lit and shadowy areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can use our Photo quality comparison tool for another look at the Galaxy S4 and HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S4 vs. HTC One vs. Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. It's pretty clear that things are going in favor of the Galaxy S4 here. It produces sharper photos with better colors and there's resolution to crop things out. The narrower FoV is not ideal but it's not a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One lost this round, though to be fair it was never expected to win a head-on fight in good lighting conditions. Its photos are certainly good enough (even better after the update) if you'll post them on Facebook or show them off on a TV, but don't come close to the samples produced with its competitor today.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, May 8: Both Samsung and HTC updated the software on their flagships and improved the camera, so we recorded new samples, made new crops and updated this page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One shoot 1080p videos at 30fps. The bitrate for the Samsung smartphone is typically between 16Mbps and 17Mbps with stereo audio making up 128Kbps of that. The HTC One goes higher with bitrates of 19Mpbs - 20Mbps and audio bitrate of 196Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference is Field of View is pretty noticeable - the Galaxy S4 fits less in the frame than the One and even the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in image quality between the two handsets is surprisingly small considering the gap between them in still photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of fine detail in both videos is comparable, which is some achievement by HTC, considering the wider FoV of the One (meaning that at the same resolution, each object is drawn with fewer pixels, but more of the scene fits into the shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One also did a good job at preserving detail in lighter areas of the image (the top of the building) and had better contrast in its videos. The shadows are slightly underexposed though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4, on the other hand, offers better color accuracy (the cloud looks purple in the HTC One video) and slightly better dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 8: Things seem to be the same here - fine detail is comparable(an advantage for the HTC One, which has a wider FoV), while the Samsung Galaxy S4 offers better dynamic range and colors more accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the FullHD video samples used to make the crops above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upadte, May 10: The HTC One also has an HDR video mode, but the effect is quite subtle overall. Note that the FoV gets a bit narrower when in HDR mode and the colors become a bit dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are in our Video quality comparison data base too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S4 vs. HTC One vs. Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One. The HTC One takes this round thanks to its much wider field of view and OIS. The Samsung Galaxy S4 can shoot great videos too, as long as you have steady hands and have enough room to take a step back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Low-light camera performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We waited until dusk and took several samples with the two phones. There are a couple of outside shots taken with Night mode on, but we also took multiple photos of our ISO chart with Night mode off and on and with flash too. We picked out the best and the worst of these to get an idea of how reliable each phone is in these conditions. We tested low-light video recording as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, let's look at the outside photos. HTC is boasting a faster, F/2.0 aperture, huge pixels and optical stabilization, all of which should result in great low-light shooting capabilities. The Samsung Galaxy S4 has an F/2.2 aperture, regular-sized pixels and no stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly though, we found the Samsung smartphone produces the better photos. They are brighter and with actual detail too. There's very little noise and the high resolution means there's plenty of detail. Colors are not perfect, but the photos are very good overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One snaps photos in night mode faster than the Galaxy S4, but they are dark, noisy and there's not a lot of fine detail to be had. On the up side, colors are more accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 8: We took new shots after the update, these were taken in auto mode. HTC One images look sharper, but due to the lower resolution some of the fine detail escaped its camera. The Galaxy S4 did manage to capture more detail, but its images suffer more from noise and have lower contrast. Interestingly, both phones shot at about the same shutter speed, even though the S4 doesn't have OIS to reduce blurring from camera shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution shots we took for this comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the Galaxy S III, the Galaxy S4 camera benefits from having its Night mode enabled - the noise levels are significantly lower and the motion blur is reduced (we're guessing shorter shutter speeds, but the Galaxy S4 doesn't record EXIF info in Night mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One meanwhile showed virtually no difference in image quality with Night mode off or on. It is a lot more consistent than the Galaxy - the best and worst shots taken with the HTC One are very close in terms of detail, while with the Galaxy S4 you have to snap several photos to make sure you have a good one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 10: We took new shots after the software update. The Galaxy S4 still benefits greatly from Night mode - in the dark you should have it either on Night mode for scenes with distant, static objects (this mode disables the flash) or turn on the flash for closer shots. The difference between the best and the worst shot of the S4 has gotten smaller, which is great - it means you have to take fewer shots to make sure you have a good one (it's still a good idea to take at least a couple).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One does light post processing for Night mode shots, which cleans up the noise and brightens up the image slightly. However, this mode slows down the shutter speed and even the OIS couldn't rescue it at times. Night mode is good for static shots, but for moving objects you need the flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones managed pretty good image quality - the HTC One offers better per-pixel quality, but if you downscale the Galaxy S4 shots you'd get similar image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out the LED flash on both the Galaxy S4 and HTC One. Note that both phones disable flash in Night mode, so we shot in auto with forced flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the HTC One photos are more consistent, while the S4 turned in some good and some bad shots. But the S4's higher resolution ultimately means its good shots are better than what the One can manage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a step back (the distance to the chart was about 2m / 6') and snapped more photos. The HTC One flash seems to light the scene more evenly, while the Galaxy S4 caused vignetting, meaning you should probably be closer than 2m / 6' when shooting with the Samsung smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 10: We redid the flash tests, but nothing has changed really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 10: You can have a peek at the full resolution shots of the chart too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We recorded sample videos too - the Samsung Galaxy S4 again offered better exposed image and slightly more detail. The difference isn't huge, but considering how close these two were in daylight we didn't expect anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 8: The HTC One has a definite advantage here - the videos have more detail and more color (even if it is oversaturated). The Galaxy S4 videos have low contrast and most of the fine detail is smudged out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OIS once again proves quite nice, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here are the two video samples, which we used to make the crop above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. Surprisingly, the Samsung Galaxy S4 has the better low-light camera performance. You'll have to snap several photos to make sure you have a good one, but the end result will be better than what the HTC One produces. The Galaxy S4 has a slight advantage in low-light video too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is more reliable - thanks to its OIS you can snap just one photo and know it will be about as good as it gets. But the camera's performance is simply nothing to write home about, and there are cases when OIS just isn't helping at all (when shooting moving subjects).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By now you should have formed an opinion of which phone you like better - each had moments where it shined and got overshadowed elsewhere. The truth is that this will be one of the most exciting fights in the premium segment this season. Yes, the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One are targeting the same market but will end up in the hands of completely different people. And it will be decided by the subtlest of differences. The blessing and the curse of being a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is perhaps easier to define - not least because a premium device has a matching premium feel. That along with features like Beats Audio and BlinkFeed will probably make the HTC One a favorite among the young crowd. Facebook and Twitter don't care much for multi-megapixel images anyway, so OIS and Zoe can really make all the difference there. Plus, the aluminum unibody is a fashion accessory for any occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 on the other hand seems like it couldn't care less about looks. This is in a way a stronger statement than the exquisite build and finish of its rival. Samsung want to show that it's the essence that matters and overall the Korean flagship certainly has more going for it than its rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see the Samsung Galaxy S4 won more of the key battles today - screen (bigger, slightly better quality), software (newer, more options, better performance) and still camera. It may have lost elsewhere, but it was never a distant second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One on the other hand emerged on top in the video recording, music and social networking categories, but those were all narrow victories. And its still camera was really nowhere near the level of the Samsung Galaxy S4 13MP shooter. Ultrapixels or not, 4MP can barely rival 2010 flagships on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, it's best if you don't just count number of victories to know which smartphone is better than this other. Instead, you should use this article as a reference - focus on the features you care about and ignore the rest. While each category has a winner and a loser, the "loser" in this shootout will be envied by most other premium phones on the market for quite some time to come. The winner? How about the one with your name on it.</paragraph>
