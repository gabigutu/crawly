			<paragraph>Designwise, the Samsung E590 is stunningly different from pretty much everything you would expect in a modern mobile phone. Yet, its armory includes a high-quality TFT display and a decent 3 megapixel camera. Plus, it's delightfully minimalist and comes at a relatively low price. All in all, though not a seducer, the Samsung E590 is a downright square deal. You are more than welcome to take the official GSMArena tour of the Samsung E590.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clean-cut and low-key, the Samsung E590 invokes mixed feelings and is definitely not an eye-catcher. We are all used to shiny plastic and metal in fashionable handsets produced under various brands. The Samsung E950 is nothing like it; in fact it's nothing like any other mobile phone on the market. This is a designer handset, but by no means in-your-face. User-friendliness, great display and a nice camera - all packed into a minimalist bar-shaped body. It looks more like a child's toy. We need not tell you, looks can be deceptive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of E590 was entrusted to the Jasper Morrison studio, renowned for the clean shapes and simplicity of their designs. You can see the portfolio of the JM Office for Design at their web site.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 is not a high-end, nor a fashion phone. Fair enough, many people will consider it when looking for a budget cameraphone. And you have our word, it is worthy of being called a cameraphone. But more on that is to come later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the E590 is available in two colors: black or white. We personally favor the black one, but that's just us.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beyond the toy-like image<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 measures 94 x 42 x 13.5 mm and weighs the meager 65 g. It's a really compact handset - it slips unnoticeably into you shirt or trouser pocket, though it's not even nearly as slim as the current record holder - the Samsung U100, which stands at no more than 5.9 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece grill can be seen just above the 1.8" TFT display. When you zoom in on the keypad, you can see how stylish the keys' shape is. The central correction (C) is right under the navigation joystick, pushing the middle column of alpha-numeric keys down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset features a volume rocker, the microSD memory card slot and the universal port for connecting the charger, the headset, or the data cable. In the lower left corner an eyelet can be seen - it is used for fastening a neck or wrist strap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features only the camera-specific keys, much like a regular digital camera. Here we find the camera mode key, the capture key, and a rocker key that is used for zooming in and out. The zoom keys are a really nice touch, but the phone sports only digital zooming, which one hardly uses, as it produces only crops of the real image. The camera mode key switches between still camera and camcorder. It's a real pity it only gets used in the camera application. It would have been nice if this key had some other function in the phone interface, when the camera is not on. The same goes for the zoom keys, too. The camera shutter key has two press levels - a halfway press for focusing and exposure locking, followed by a full press which actually takes the picture. This half-shutter mode is available in Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot handsets but it appears in a Samsung handset for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the handset features no controls at all, and the only thing that marks the bottom is the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside of the Samsung E590 follows the same minimalist design and only the camera lens sticks out. The lens itself is recessed so there's no risk of scratching the protecting glass, but we ended up leaving a smudgy finger over it ever too often, as the handset is so small. There's no flash or a self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of small, holding it in hand will give you a nice perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the rear panel, opening the battery cover with a simple slide unveils the standard Samsung Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 800 mAh. The battery is quoted at 300 hours of standby time and 4 hours of talk time. In reality the battery will give you a good 4 days of moderate use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Small but fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 has a relatively small 1.8" TFT display with a resolution of 220 x 220 pixels. It's not a groundbreaking resolution, but the display is really fine. The legibility under direct sunlight is alright, but we've seen better displays by Nokia. The handset features the so-called Sunlight mode to improve visibility, but this mode is only available in the camera interface. The Samsung E950 (don't get the E950 and E590 mixed up), which we reviewed recently had that option throughout the whole user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the keypad of the Samsung E590 very much with its big rounded keys with ample space between them. Typing is easy and the keys have excellent tactile feedback. Navigation is entrusted to a joystick, which is not common for the South Korean company. We suppose the Jasper Morrison studio is pretty much responsible for it. The joystick is comfortable enough, no reason for grudges.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pimp my dial pad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Using Samsung E590 as a regular phone is a nice experience, too. The sound levels are loud enough, while during calls the sound quality is as good as it might be expected from any contemporary phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung, as you always have some sort of dialing animation or a choice of several ones. With the E590 you only have one animation or you can choose to type your numbers in color. When dialing a number, the Samsung E590 has a nice feature called simple search, which looks up your phonebook for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you've typed. Samsung D900 (the first Ultra lineup) doesn't have that feature, while Samsung U700 (the second Ultra lineup) has an even more advanced version of it, called Smart search.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface in black or white<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 home screen is fully user-configurable. Service icons provide information on signal strength, battery, as well as info about the inserted memory card. Several clock styles are available. You can set a photo or other image as a background, and even use two or more alternating images. The proprietary Samsung uGo feature automatically updates the home screen background to display landmarks of the city or country you're in. The scenery even changes when night falls. In standby the upwards direction of the joystick activates the proprietary Samsung My Menu. It features several user-configurable shortcuts for your convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the E590 is quite common and is used in all current Samsung handsets - it's called uMenu. The number of the main menu icons is a total of nine and, as with most previous models, the menu features a white color scheme. It proves useful when you use the handset in the bright sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, the last used items and sub-items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu. We like it this way and it proves useful when you use a given feature more than once. Of course, some may not agree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with almost all of the past Samsung handsets, no ringing profiles are available. All you have at your disposal is the Silent and Normal ringing modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 also has an automatic keylock feature, which works great. Now on most other handsets with auto keylock, the feature would go off when you leave the handset idle for a predefined period of time but only if you leave it on the standby screen. The Samsung E590 auto keylock activates no matter what the currently active screen is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Managing contacts and calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung E590 can store up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It can display the names from the phone memory only or all names from both the phone memory and the SIM card at once. Searching employs gradual typing of the contact's name. Samsung E590 does not search in both the contact's first and last name. That option though was available back in Samsung D900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A total of 13 fields of information are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers for each contact plus an email address and a note. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture. You can even assign a video as a "caller's image" - a feature that was absent in Samsung D900. Contacts can be organized into groups, but calls cannot be filtered on the base of created groups. We were happy to see the contact's birthday field here, which lacked in the recently reviewed Samsung E950. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't any innovations in the call management department. The Dial key on the touchpad opens a list of the recent contacts, while opening the Call log from the main menu will provide additional details.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E590 manages SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. SMS, EMS and MMS use one and the same editor. MMS are created through a selection from the menu or by inserting an image, which makes the editor automatically switch from SMS to MMS. EMS allows you to apply formatting and font colors to your text messages. T9 dictionary is there to assist you; both browsing and adding new words is fast and intuitive. If sending fails, say because of a network failure, the message is saved to the Outbox. The Samsung E590 can store up to 1000 messages (Samsung D900, for example could only store 200). You can block incoming messages based on a black list you define.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. Attachment size for outgoing mail is 300KB while the size for incoming mail is 5MB. The client can be set up to check mail at predefined intervals (user-configurable, of course). Message blocking is available here, too, based on sender address or subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary Samsung SOS message function allows you to quickly send an SOS message to user-defined numbers. After you set up the feature, you just need to press the volume rocker 4 times when the keypad is locked to send your cries for help to your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to security, this Samsung handset is also equipped with the uTrack function or the so called Mobile Tracker. When you set it up and your phone gets stolen, once somebody puts a SIM card other than yours in the handset, the E590 will start sending secret tracking messages to user-defined numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. The phone memory and the memory card are separate but they both have the same folder structure. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. Functionality of the file browser is sufficient. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete folders (except for the primary ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files too can be sent one by one or in bulk via Bluetooth. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent deleting them by accident. The only downside we found is the really slow reading speed from the memory card. Listing thumbnails of the pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card seemed to take ages (no matter whether it's almost full or almost empty). We've never seen a Samsung handset read a memory card so slowly, so our best guess is that it may be some unit-specific problem with our handset or with our memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 picture gallery is part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. You can copy or move images but only to the Images folder on the memory card and vice versa. Much like with Samsung D900, you can view the pictures as a plain list or as a list with thumbnails. And again, you can sort files by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view it, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view the picture full screen, but only in portrait mode (landscape pictures get cropped a bit). The image gallery also has a slide show capability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can do a bit of editing on your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's the same as the one in Samsung D900 and is not as feature-rich as the Scalado image editor we saw in Samsung U700 and Samsung E950. The Image Editor here allows you to apply 8 special filters such as black and white, negative, sepia, blur, sharpen, sketch, posterize, and solarize. You can also adjust brightness, contrast and color. You can of course flip or rotate the image, as well as insert a frame, some clip art or an emoticon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music is important<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 90MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung E590 can be comfortably used as a portable music player. The Music player application is the same as the one in D900 (the new player is available in Samsung U700 and E950) and is rather basic. It doesn't allow filtering tracks by author or album. You can create up to four custom playlists - a feature that lacked in Samsung D900. Fortunately, you can minimize the application to continue playing in the background. The player does have several equalizer presets (you cannot create one of your own) plus a 3D sound effect. You can also make use of some pretty loud volume levels. The supported audio file formats are MP3, WMA, AAC, eAAC, eAAC+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most Samsung handsets, the retail box will supply you with a wired headset that comes complete with a microphone and a remote control. There's not an option to replace those, as Samsung doesn't offer a standard audio jack adapter. You can use however a Bluetooth headset for listening to music - both a mono and a stereo one will do the job as Samsung E590 supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 comes complete with an FM radio, which is a quite handy feature. You can store up to 30 radio stations. There is no RDS but you can set user-defined names to the stations just so you know which one to choose next time you go out. An innovative feature, however, is the option to set up to 3 program reminders so that you don't miss your favorite radio shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Music player and the FM radio have a similar interface; the same holds true for the video player. It doesn't have many features but it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Is the E590 a cameraphone?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E590 features a 3 megapixel camera with auto focus, which can take pictures at a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. There are several view modes - the only way to see the whole composition is to select the "standard ratio" viewfinder. While the fullscreen viewfinder is pleasing to the eye, it doesn't allow you to see the whole composition you are shooting since it crops and shows you only the central part of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 comes with an intriguing accessory to help in your photographic endeavors. The bean bag included in the retail package can be used to position your handset for shooting self portraits or just for steadying your shots. The bag has a cap with a wrist strap so that you don't loose it. Removing the cap allows you to actually plug the bean bag into the universal port, which is conveniently placed dead center on the handset's left side. The bean bag is definitely not a revolutionary feature - Sony Ericsson has already started selling a cameraphone kit with a tripod for their Cyber-shot lineup. Hence, the bean bag here does make a strong cameraphone statement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of showing settings with icons in the bottom of the screen while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot, mosaic, panorama), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, emboss), clip art frames, white balance, and ISO (Auto or 100-400).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has additional settings, which are accessible in the dedicated camera setting menu. They include stuff like picture quality, scene modes (normal and night time landscape), exposure metering (matrix, center-weighted and spot), shutter sound, zoom sound, brightness sound, auto focus beeps, default storage memory and default naming for photos. As you can see, there are wide-ranging settings as one might expect in a cameraphone. There is even a macro mode, but our test showed there's not much need for it, as the auto focus handles close shots just fine without turning the macro mode on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the photos produced by the Samsung E590 camera is relatively good. It's perfectly on par with the Samsung D900. The colors are natural and the only thing worth pointing out about them is that they look pretty sharpened. That's not necessarily a bad thing - they look better this way without any further editing. If you are into making prints of your cameraphone photos, they would deliver a nice result. However for people, who prefer retouching their own photos, this over-sharpened processing would cause them troubles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also able to shoot video - in the so-called Camcorder mode. Recording length is only limited by the available free memory. The user interface of the camcorder is pretty much the same as the one of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590, as most other Samsung handsets, captures MPEG-4 videos with a maximum resolution of CIF (352 x 288 pixels) at 15 fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mediocre web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung E590 you can count on EDGE and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. As we've already mentioned, it also comes equipped with Bluetooth which even allows listening to music on a stereo headset (A2DP profile support). The Bluetooth functionality works seamlessly when transferring data to and from a PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. A data cable will allow for even faster file transfers. When connected, the handset gets charged, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the phone as a modem with a PC is also an option. Such transfers can be made via Bluetooth or through the data cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NetFront 3.2 web browser of the Samsung E590 is mediocre - it loads pages really slowly. It doesn't offer fullscreen or landscape view, nor is there an option for zooming in or out on the page. It's only a tad better than the Openwave Mobile Browser used in the first Samsung Ultra lineup (sorry for mentioning D900 again). The situation gets even worse as the only way to install a Java application is by downloading it with the web browser. When dealing with downloads the browser is dodgy at best and more than often you'll find yourself unable to download the application of your choice due to some unknown "Insufficient memory" glitch (even with loads of free memory space).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Just give me a task<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung E590 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are four types of events available: appointment, anniversary, task and miscellany. The Calendar can store up to 100 items of each type. Much like D900, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick which day the week starts on - Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up to three alarm slots are available and each one of them can be set to repeat on given days of the week. There's a separate setting for the type of snooze you would like to have for each of those three alarm slots. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers a memo application, voice recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will cater to sports-minded users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, finally it is worth mentioning that the Samsung E590 has support for viewing MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files by means of the integrated Picsel viewer. The viewer itself is a nice application, but it's rather slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The world of Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to games, Samsung have their handsets packed with them. It's quite pleasing to see all those titles sitting in the fun corner. Alas, most of the games turn out to be trial versions only. The Samsung E590 has full support for Java MDIP 2.0 so you can download additional titles and even other applications. Unfortunately, the only way to get a Java application or a game work on a Samsung handset is to download it online with the handset itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games that the Samsung E590 bundles up are Cannonball, Forgotten Warrior, Midnight Pool (trial), Mini Golf Las Vegas (trial), Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest (trial), and Sonic the Hedgehog (also trial). As you've probably guessed, the most interesting of them are the trial ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well we've reached the end of this review. It was a gratifying experience and we even got to like the shy and reserved looks of this device. It's compact, it's really well equipped and it has a nice camera. The E590 is out of the usual run and stands out of the Samsung crowd. It's not a high-end product, nor is it a superior cameraphone. Yet, given its balanced features and rich retail equipment, the Samsung E590 is a real bargain. Especially if you?d appreciate a designer phone that doesn?t look like one, and you don?t mind that some people may confuse neat and simple with cheap-o-plastic.</paragraph>
