			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the world of mobile phones it's all about diversity, and just about everyone has their favorite. We've seen enough of brand loyalty taken to extremes but it's for the first time we come across a phone that might deal with anything you can throw at it (or better yet - anything that you throw it at). Sonim XP1 is said to survive just about anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This ultra-durable bloke can take some impressive abuse and the worst weather extremities. The XP1 may be somewhat under the weather featurewise but hardly any other phone can put up with what this soldier can endure. If you are just as curious as we are, join us as we take the Sonim XP on a really rough ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>XP1 model designation has nothing to do with either Micro, or Soft. It stands for Xtreme Performance, simple as that. Sonim XP1 is officially proof against a stream of water, near 1.7-meter-high drop to concrete, and has an operational range from -20C to 60C. We've seen it tossed and kicked around, run over by cars, treaded on by elephants, dropped in a cement mixer. Meet the survivor form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sonim XP1 (also known as JCB Toughphone in some markets and the Chuck Norris phone in our office) was created for the most challenging of environments and activities. Hardened rubber is molded to the durable non-porous casing, keypad buttons are tested to 500,000 pushes, the screen has a scratch-resistant coating. Finally, the USB port, ear jack and external antenna port are sealed with plastic caps so moist and dirt are kept away from those vulnerable points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Technically, Sonim XP1 is not alone in its class, but the competition is barely up to par when it comes to the most important point: durability. The XP1 redefines ruggedized and scoffs in the face of Sony Ericsson C702, Nokia 5500 Sport and Samsung M110. That's well reflected in the price too: the XP1 is the most expensive of the lot. Don't bother guessing the cost of GPS, built-in camera, MP3 player, quad-band GSM and 3.5G. Indestructible costs and you'll just have to have Sonim's word on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, here's one for you. You're reviewing cars and you're well on top of things. You get them sedans, estates and coupes inside out, you peek under the hood, you rev them up, you push them hard, you love'm, you hate'm, and you're so in control. Then suddenly, a monster truck falls in your lap. What do you do? We, for one, would put a helmet and go car smashing. No, seriously, we didn't do any nasty experiments to the Sonim XP1, but we've prepared a nice video compilation of such tricks so that you can see that the Sonim XP1 is built to last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough of that babbling, let's get to some real tough work - reviewing the Sonim XP1 ultra durable GSM phone. Take this jump to continue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sonim XP1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The box of the Sonim XP1 is nothing spectacular - we were a bit disappointed as we expected some impressive heavy duty box to go along with the handset reputation. The retail package contents are as scarce and unassuming as the handset itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A charger and a plastic belt clip is all you get - there's not even a headset to go along for hands-free usage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sonim XP1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sonim XP1 measures the respectable 114 x 50 x 22 mm and weighs 130.3 grams. Its casing is made of plastic and hardened rubber with no metal elements whatsoever. We've seen the all black and black-on-yellow variety, but Sonim offers customizable colors on large orders so you can pretty much have it in your construction company signature colors (just joking, aye?).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the black Sonim XP1 can easily go unnoticed and that makes things all the sweeter. Unimposing, but utterly reliable: that must be music to the ears of enough people out there. And no, we wouldn't call it ugly either, considering what it's meant for. You'll do best to take a look at the photos and judge for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the front panel of XP1 houses the protected earpiece. Right under it is the 65K-color scratch-resistant display of 128 x 160 pixel resolution and a 1.77" diagonal. Legibility suffers under direct sunlight, but indoors is quite OK. Anyway, that's not the biggest of issues given that browsing the phonebook and reading texts is pretty much all you need it for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we guess Sonim should have increased the screen font a bit - that way they could have snatched a second target group too - that of the elderly DIY fixers that never miss a chance to step on their phone while trimming their latest bird house project (that's enough now, we guess you should have got the joke by now).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you get at the top of the handset is a wide lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of XP1 is pretty neat, with the external antenna connector only sealed under a rubber cap. The left side features the PTT combo with volume controls and transmit key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several apertures at the bottom of the handset. The miniUSB port is here, hidden under a tough rubber lid. Next to it is the 2.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the keys on the keypad to be quite rigid but were surprised to find them quite responsive. They are officially stated to withstand 500.000 pushes, good luck trying to text that keypad off! The keypad backlighting is a pleasing blue color but not that even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside of Sonim XP1 are the loudspeaker grill and the battery cover with its special lock, which makes sure an accidental drop won't pop it off. As you will se later on, the loudspeaker is capable of quite a feats (meaning you will be able to hear your calls even with a stone crusher working by).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is released by a half turn of the latch at the bottom. It's easier said than done though and some kind of tool will definitely come in handy. You have to be very determined to remove the tight battery cover. Under it is the powerful 1100 mAh Li-Ion battery and the SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer promises up to 200 h of standby time and up to 5 h of talk time. That doesn't sound much, but our Sonim XP1 worked flawless almost a week on a single charge - so it offers excellent battery life by our standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rubber enhancements and the 22 mm thickness give the Sonim XP1 one of the best grips we've experienced. Handling the phone instills a feeling of trust and reliability. It's only that we couldn't help but wish that the Sonim XP 1 had some other hardware features such as a compass, a light torch or perhaps, even a spirit level - that way you could really put the Sonim XP1 at work.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: as simple as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Impressive enough on the outside, Sonim XP1 holds no fancy stuff inside. The Spartan user interface is pretty much on par with the most basic of low-enders out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 3 grid of icons with corresponding alphanumeric key shortcuts. Deeper level submenus don't have keypad shortcuts and are only navigated with the D-pad. The low display resolution renders each pixel clearly visible, yet the icons do not look that coarse. The light-heeled and responsive user interface feels quite at home in this heavy-duty no-nonsense phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The main menu is simple </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home screen is pretty modest too. The basic status readings are all there, such as signal strength, service provider, time, battery status and the two soft key functions. Additional icons also get displayed to indicate home network/roaming, missed events, silent/vibrate mode, alarm on, etc. The home screen can use different wallpapers or one of the four predefined types: Digital, Analog, Month view and Universal time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Different home screen views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sonim XP1 also has tree color themes to choose from</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best things about the interface is the wide range of assignable shortcuts in standby on alphanumeric keys and the D-pad. The D-pad even accommodates 8 of them, as each of its direction keys has a short press/long press action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Shortcuts galore</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Regular phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook stores up to 500 entries with a total of 2500 phone number fields available. You can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be default for the phonebook. Displaying both lists simultaneously is impossible. Pressing the phonebook icon from the menu or on a shortcut does not open the phonebook itself, but the options menu, which is quite an odd decision. "View contacts list" is not even the first option on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The phonebook icon in the menu brings up options, instead of the actual contact list </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one name field for a contact. If you're importing contacts with two name fields via Bluetooth, the names will be merged in the Sonim XP1 phonebook. Contact searching is quite rudimentary - there's no gradual typing and you have to enter the exact name or part of it, then press OK key and only then will the contact be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calling our friend Johnny ? Creating/editing a contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a new contact you can enter one name, up to five different numbers, email, postal code, postal address and notes. There is no way to add new fields or change field labels. Caller groups and speed dial are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the call management extras is the call filter with dedicated black and white list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The Call filter ? some other call settings</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All calls are there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Call log is divided into three different lists: Outgoing, Received, and Missed. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last one gets displayed. Selecting such an entry though will display the individual call times on separate rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The Call list menus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker performance is really impressive: Sonim is the second loudest phone we've ever tested. It's deafening, especially with the preinstalled monophonic ringtones. Here is how the Sonim XP1 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can find more info about our loudspeaker test, as well as the results of other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is a thousand strong<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging just couldn't have been simpler with Sonim XP1. There's no email client aboard, all you get is SMS. Storage is impressive though, with 1000 texts a respective count by all means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Simple messaging and impressive storage of up to 1000 entries</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, a character counter displays the number left to the 160-character limit. Predictive typing is available. Those who don't use T9 will have to turn it off each time a new message is being created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice option is adding a "signature" to each new message, quite surprising to find in a phone like this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Signature option in the settings menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Short on applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get it straight, don't be looking for fancy stuff in Sonim XP1. There's no video and MP3 player (there's still support for MP3 ringtones), only a basic file manager and some standard organizer applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager, actually called "My Files", contains two folders - Pictures and Sounds. Pictures are listed as text links, which open the image in the only available full screen mode. No zoom in on images or slideshows here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music files don't open in a separate window but are directly played in the file manager folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available applications in Sonim XP1 are placed under Tools. They include an organizer, alarm clock, calculator, audio recorder, Bluetooth, stopwatch, countdown timer and universal time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Tools menu contain most of the applications of XP1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The simple Organizer has Month and Week view modes. Scheduling a new meeting or memo is quite basic, options boil down to setting a date, start and end time and adding text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The organizer ? creating a new event </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock is very simple. An alarm can be set to go off once, everyday, on weekdays, and everyday except Sunday. Setting the alarm tone is available in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Alarm clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator, audio recorder, stopwatch, count-down timer and universal time are the features that complete the basic PIM list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calculator ? Audio recorder and Stopwatch apps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the basic web browser is doing fine with WAP optimized sites.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The toughest phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sonim XP1 has been around for enough time that a number of people have tried throwing it from the second floor, bashing it against a wall, running it over with a car, pouring it with what-not, and even shooting it with a gun. Luckily, all those attempts have been recorded on video, so we've picked the best - most of them are short and are quite fun actually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sonim XP1 is an unassuming no-nonsense handset with the sole purpose of providing you with a communication tool in all conditions (no matter how harsh). It hasn't got much stuff on board, but hey, in a ruggedized handset every fancy feature missing is simply one thing less to worry about when you drop it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we think the manufacturer could have done better - from basic stuff such as the lack of wired headset and the lack of flashlight functionality to some more advanced features that we consider missing - such as a larger screen font and a FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the Sonim XP1 is a real survivor but we doubt that it would do it any good with that hefty price tag. 300 euro for the ultimate heavy-duty phone may not sound as a rip-off, but you should remember that for that kind of money you could easily get yourself a good half a dozen other handsets with the same feature set. They may not be as tough as our champion here, but they simply win by numbers. After all, with a fleet of six cellphones you can easily have five sledgehammered and you'd still have one to talk on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as always, it's a matter of priorities, but we think that Sonim should either return to the drawing board and add some power to this baby, or they should seriously reconsider their pricing - anything above 150 euro seems way beyond what it's worth.</paragraph>
