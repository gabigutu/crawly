			<paragraph>Motorola E398 freely follows all company's previous V-models but the construction is classic and besides other functions it comes up with a revolutionary feature: it has two speakers and can play MP3 loud and in stereo. Its control is identical to those of V600, V500 or V80 models. Therefore we won't deal with functions that are common for all models and we'll focus more on design and the aspects that differs E398 from its colleagues.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Blue-silver classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With its dimensions of 108 x 46 x 21 mm Motorola E398 belongs to mid big handsets. The construction is classic, with a keypad on the front. The front side is dominated by the active colour display, which sizes respectively are 30 x 37 mm. It features resolution of 176 x 220 pixels and displays 65k colours. This top class display offers very good brightness and contrast and is well readable even in outdoor light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display window is placed quite deep under protective glass framed by silver-grey border. The border is bent to an arc on the upper part and you can find a round metal silver Motorola company sign on the top of the arc. The lower part of the front side consists of control handset elements - a numeric keypad, joystick and function keys separated from the display by a blue partition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below the display there are four keys, which are situated tightly beside each other. The two side keys are the soft keys. The left middle key is printed with a T-Mobile logo and it automatically connects the phone to t-zones if you press it. The right middle key is marked with four horizontal lines and is used for entering the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under these four keys you can find a slightly bent silver strip with two oval chrome keys used to make and receive calls (in classic configuration). There is a small five-directional joystick - in chrome as well - placed between them. A recessed hollow is designed around the joystick to make the joystick usage easier and effortless. The hollow stretches a bit up to both middle keys and down to the "2" key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remaining space on the front side is taken by the numeric keypad organized in a standard square matrix form with twelve keys. The whole grid is slightly bent down, which gives it some kind of dynamic and boost appearance. The white illuminated keypad shines enough in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the keypad, on the interface between the front and the bottom part, there is a model mark decided in striking blue letters. It's overlaid by a silicon pillow and is appearing quite unsuitable on the elegant phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Everything is set on the side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is trimmed by a silver stripe almost all around. On its both sides, approximately on the display level, there are two symmetrically situated speakers, protected with ribbing. The colour LEDs are hidden under the speakers and blink in some situations. As symmetrically as the speakers, a silver Motorola logo is imprinted on both phone sides into the silver trim. It represents a nice complement and is really not obtruding the overall appearance of the mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper part of the left phone side you can see a two-directional key for setting the ringing volume, the speaker volume during calls and for browsing the menu as well. In the middle, below the speaker, there is a chrome button, which will help you reaching the sound bank. On the right side, above the speaker, a camera release is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A headphone connector protected by a grey rubber cover is placed on the topside of the phone. The headphones are delivered as an accessory. Comparing to the headphones, which have very attractive design, the rubber cover looks very unsightly when you uncover it. It extends from the phone and freely sways. The bottom part of the phone is equipped with a standard system connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside of Motorola E398 consists of a blue battery cover with a big M (Motorola) mark imprinted on it. On the bottom part of the battery cover there is a safety lock, which enables you to take away the cover if you press it. The remaining part of the backside is silver. It contains camera lens system and a mirror for self-portrait taking both placed in a chrome oval. Below and apart of them, there is a flash light diode. In the corners of the silver part there are - quite illogically - two uncovered screws, holding the cover. An external antenna connector, hidden under a grey rubber cover, is placed asymmetrically in one of the corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the back cover and the battery removal, there are two slots with metal covers in the bottom of the mobile. The classic SIM slot is not really interesting - unlike the second one. It's designed for a miniature memory card with 64 MB capacity. Removing and inserting of both cards is easy and won't make you any difficulties. The attached cover doesn't fully tightly fit and that's why creaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall design impression is very nice, but the ribbed speakers cover reminds me an ancient time TV set. It's a pity that designers spoiled the - otherwise very good and well-balanced - design adding the big model mark on the bottom of the front side and the half-baked cover of the headphones. Yet, those are only details and so I would evaluate the handset design as very good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dancing keys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu can't deny phone's origin. I mean that the menu won't surprise those users who have already come in touch with Motorola V series phones. It's possible to display the menu it in a list form or as a square matrix of nine positions with animated icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with previous models, users can find help how to assign different functions to individual directions of joystick moves. Also it's possible to customise the phone by usage of two different graphical themes: the phone offers you a black-pink T-Mobile and a bluish style Moto. Overall, the menu orientation is comfy, but the mobile is a bit slowly reacting to entering the values.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu browsing is firm and comfortable with the joystick even though it's small in size. It's not slippery and is optimally stiff. Working with the soft keys is also good. Only the menu key seems to me a bit kept down beside the t-zones key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is quite comfy as well. Keys are wobbling at touch a bit, which affects side key groups, but in fact it has no influence on proper press. Keys are suitably stiff and because they are slightly knobbed, thumb goes safely on them. Well, they could be knobbed a little bit better to ensure higher safety of touch. Back cover has an intrusive impact on typing because it constantly menacingly creaks. When I tapped or pressed harder "1" or "4" keys, I heard a low sound - something like a twang of a spring. Also I felt a soft resonation in my palm. I'm not sure, but I've got a feeling that it might be connected to "a club lights function" which will be described later in the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stereo ringing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone book can contain up to 1000 multi-item entries, which can be assigned to various photos, pictures or specific ringing tones. It allows users to work with the phone memory and with the SIM memory at the same time. Searching the contacts in the phone book is still performed only by first letter. Setting up a call is the same as with previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Terminating calls really surprised me, as I discovered a problem with phone reactions again. After pressing the terminating key, for a second nothing showed on the display that the call was terminated immediately. It made press the red key repeatedly because I guessed I didn't press it correctly first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker quality is high and setting talk volume is comfortable with the side two-directional button. The loud handsfree proves sound quality as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Really noteworthy about this mobile phone are the up to 24 channel ringtones. Thanks to the exceptional quality speakers, hidden under the grids on the phone sides, hearing ringtones is pleasurable. The phone has enough of them and you'll surely choose one. You can also find stereophonic ringing tones, which make the sound traveling from left to right and back. It's really spectacular. By maximum volume sound is pure, spatial and you could also hear some fine bass tones. It's not a Hi-Fi of course, but considering the fact that's a mobile phone, I take my hat off to Motorola engineers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By maximum loudness the intensity of sound is so high that by resounding tones the battery cover vibrates and you can feel it in the palm. If the phone lies down on the table at that time, it bounces to the rhythm and passes on the table. You should keep that in mind and do not put the phone set with maximum volume on high-situated places, where it might fall down from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Together with ringing the integrated colour LEDs blink from behind of both speakers' grinds. They blink by a light scheme, which could be selected from eight variants. Moreover, the whitely illuminated keypad blinks in various intervals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where are you going, Mr. Snail?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big and organized keypad makes typing comfortable but phone's speed is hard going. The reaction speed is the most serious vice of the phone and that goes twice for SMS writing. In standard mode the speed is lower than usual but is still quite O.K. Try however to use the "copy and paste function". If you have some text stored in the box, the phone reactions slows down so that it's almost unacceptable. Hence I would rather avoid the copy text function though I considered it useful first. Pity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a message writing the phone doesn't display number of messages to be sent but it displays characters countdown, starting from 450 characters, in the right upper corner of the display. During iTap predictive writing the phone shows another strange feature - the display unexpectedly switches off. It's really unpleasant if you write SMS in the dark, when you need keys to be illuminated. It doesn't switch off during normal writing, without using the iTap dictionary. Most probably that is a matter of actual firmware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports MMS and has an integrated email client. These functions are the same as in the other high-end Motorola phones - V80 for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The same as before<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for organizer functions, the phone is standard equipped. Calendar is well arranged; it shows monthly and daily views, allows users to set start of a day and it can erase expired records automatically. It features the same functions as the previous V600 and V80 models. The same comes for alarm clock and calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola E398 features a build-in VGA camera, which allows snapping with maximal resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, and offers also max 4x digital zoom. The integrated flash on the backside brings up possibility to light up the taken scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Captured pictures can be stored on the 64MB Trans-Flash memory card, which is included in the package. The camera lens is quite embedded into the phone and therefore is hardly accessible for cleaning the dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's possible to connect the phone via Bluetooth or USB cable. You can also use USB cable to record e.g. new sounds on the memory card. Motorola E398 supports GPRS class 10 and features WAP browser, supporting version 2.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>So small and so loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone includes entertaining functions - three games and one video file in MP4 format - a Motorola blurb. Most interesting is the possibility to play MP3 music files. As I already mentioned, the phone is equipped with an excellent sound installation. Playing music is enjoyable with Motorola E398: the sound is pure and bright, dynamic enough, and if you wish, it could be loud enough to listen to in a car or among a group of people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another entertaining Motorola E398 feature is also connected with music. The function is called club lights and is the same as the function integrated in the V80 model. Basically, It's an adjustable sensitivity to vibrations, which makes keypad, display and side colour LEDs blink at every vibration over the sensitivity limits. So if you have set the sensitivity e.g. to 1 (which is a maximum), your phone will brightly blink to the music rhythm. Funny, isn't it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interesting thing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Due to the featured good display, camera and integrated functions, Motorola E398 comes among high-class mobile phones. If we close one eye for the speed, add the very good design (except few details) and mainly stereophonic sound, the result is a really good phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will be sold most probably by T-Mobile and on the open market. For testing purposes we got T-Mobile's design version, which environment options are different - for example the t-zones key below the display. The key probably won't be available on the open market version phones and it'll be sold with the menu key only.</paragraph>
