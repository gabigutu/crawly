			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are on the hunt for a stylish smartphone but you run a tight budget, chances are the Nokia C5 is on your radar already. The compact Symbian-running handset looks well, costs little and can give you all the smart you need in a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more so if you need your mobile phone to do voice-guided navigation. The Nokia C5 comes with a lifetime license that costs exactly zilch. Now, isn?t this one of the handsets to claim the best bang for your buck on the market? As always there?re compromises involved, but the price tag hanging on that metal body won?t make you think twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last week we reviewed the Nokia 6700 slide and while it wasn?t a revelation, it did well to reassure us Nokia still have it when it comes to neat, compact and affordable smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is not so much a rival of the 6700 slide, but a partner in the lower end of non-touch smartphones. We won?t get tired of saying that giving the user a choice is a good thing ? you can have (and pay for) only the features that you do need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that the Nokia C5 won?t give you is WLAN. We?ve been there already with the 6700 slide. It certainly doesn?t look good on the spec sheet, but we hope the performance and ergonomics will make up for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Down to earth retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is economy class and the retail package is simple and to the point. All the basics are covered and that?s that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2GB microSD card and that tiny Nokia microUSB cable are identical to what you get with the Nokia 6700 slide, and so is the charger. In fact, the only change is the cheap-looking one-piece headset that this time goes into 3.5mm jacks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C5 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 measures 112 x 46 x 12.3 mm (a volume of 56 cc), which makes for a pretty compact phone. We have seen smaller, of course, but slipping the C5 in your pocket will be no trouble at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal rear might be adding a few grams but at 89.3 g of total weight, the Nokia C5 feels pretty light actually. The upside of this is you may as well forget about it in your pocket, but it does lack the solid feel that heavier phones give.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 plays it safe on design and doesn?t try anything stupid. No, it?s not a phone that will turn any heads but the styling is unmistakably Nokia. There?s no display of finery, no E-series sophistication. The new C-series have a different brief ? simplicity and reliability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia C5 is not the kind of phone to impress customers ? metal clad or not. But it certainly won?t put them off either. Given the balance of features and the good build, the conservative styling of the C5 might be a good thing after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" display takes the upper half of Nokia C5 front panel. The TFT LCD unit has QVGA resolution and can display up to 16 million colors. Despite its decent brightness, the image quality is nothing to rave about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have been using this exact type of displays on their handsets for years now and they do feel outdated. Against WVGA and Super AMOLED screens, a small TFT display of QVGA resolution is just low-end and there?s nothing to do about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size is the other problem with the Nokia C5 display; 2.2" just isn?t enough. Yes, it?s an entry level smartphone and they clearly wanted it as compact as possible, but 2.4" would?ve been way better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the sunlight legibility of the Nokia C5 is great, the screen remaining perfectly legible outdoors in any weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six keys under the display ? three either side of the traditional D-pad. The controls include two soft keys, Menu and Clear buttons, as well as the Call and End keys. All are decently sized and very solid to press. The menu and clear keys are actually small but comfortably raised, which makes them easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad has a pretty thin frame of direction keys, but no worries to use even in our big hands. The fact that there is so much free space around it also helps, so size is no obstacle to usability really. The large confirmation center button is welcome indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the navigation deck is the 12-key alphanumeric keypad. We dare say it?s among the best we?ve seen. Not that we?ve been dealing with numpads too much recently ? it?s been mostly touchscreen. But anyway, the keys on the C5 are great in size and nicely shaped to stick to your thumb. The solid, even feedback is also greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only two things left to note on the front are the video-call camera and the loudspeaker grill at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Nokia C5 are pretty bare. The left hand side of the Nokia C5 holds nothing but the lanyard eyelet. On the right, you get the volume rocker and the memory card slot. There is no camera key, but there?s no real need for it considering the Nokia C5 only packs a 3.2 megapixel fixed-focus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What really bothered us was the microSD card slot. It?s great having it on the side ? readily available to handle your memory card trouble-free. That was the idea at least, but the implementation is quite a bit of nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s nearly impossible to reach to the card and push to eject it. The slot is just too deep in the phone?s body. And to make matters worse, the card refuses to go out even if you manage to push it. It gets stuck in the slot and you need to scratch and pull hard to take it out. That seems a real ergonomic blunder by Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the slot can handle 16GB microSD card (probably 32GB too, though we can?t confirm at this point) and is of course hot-swap-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the right too and not quite comfortable either. It?s a bit too thin and quite stiff, lacking proper press feedback. We can live with that though, as it has very limited use across the Symbian OS anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia C5 features the microUSB port, the 3.5mm audio jack and the Nokia proprietary charger plug. The microUSB slot can also be used for charging if you prefer. There's no protection on top - all of the connectivity ports are exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the mouthpiece is on the keypad, there is nothing of note on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the handset features the 3 megapixel camera lens, accompanied by one of the tiniest LED flash units we have ever seen. The loudspeaker grills are also here, on the bottom end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens has no protection against scratches save for being slightly set in. That means you need to be careful handling the phone if you want the image quality to stay the same as the day you bought the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the steel battery cover reveals the SIM card slot and the 1050 mAh BL-5CT Li-Ion battery. Quoted at up to 12 hours of talk time and 630 hours of stand-by in 2G networks or 5 hours of talk time and 670 hours of stand-by in 3G networks, the battery really sounds like something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality we only had to charge the Nokia C5 once for the 10 days that it was with us. It didn?t see too much use (about 15 minutes of telephony a day plus about 40 minutes of using other phone features) but that?s still a pretty good achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Nokia C5 should be one of the phone?s best selling points. The only thing to be especially careful about is the cover of the memory card slot. It has a hard hinge instead of a bendable fix ? and that makes it particularly fragile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the phone looks and feels sturdy enough to stick with you for quite a while. Fingerprints are no issue either, except on the screen. In terms of ergonomics, the C5 is near perfect ? with the exception of the fiddly memory card slot. Comfortable navigation deck and one of the best numpads make the phone great to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian is pleased to serve<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is powered by Symbian 9.3 and runs on the S60 3rd edition user interface with Feature Pack 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the homescreen you can enable a Contact bar, which has been an option on Nokia handsets long enough now. It?s a row of select contacts that add to the usual shortcuts and tabs of the Symbian S60 Active standby homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite contacts are placed on top, each represented by the contact photo and their first name. Four contacts are visible at a time and you can scroll left and right for the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the Contact list, it's pretty much standard Active Standby. There are a few tabs for homescreen applications. The user-configurable options are: Calendar, Ovi Contacts and the Contact bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar tab shows the most recent upcoming appointment in the calendar. The email tab shows the number of unread messages and sender and Re: field of the most recent message. The Ovi Contacts panel shows your status and number of friends online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Contact bar is enabled, the music player tab is missing ? there?s obviously no room for it on the screen. The player can be minimized to play in the background but you have no way of controlling it unless you go back to the app via the task manager. A bummer, we know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen are the usual 6 Active Standby shortcuts to applications or bookmarks of your choice. Shortcuts can be assigned to either of the soft keys too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Active Standby layouts are still available and include Basic - you can assign shortcuts to the D-pad, Horizontal icons bar - the old Active Standby and, finally, the Vertical icons bar, which has only tabs (shortcuts, calendar, music player and personalization) but doesn't hide much of the wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all Symbian phones, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It does a good job, being fully speaker-independent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager appears on every pop-up menu. It's actually placed on top of every list, which can be a little irritating at times, considering you can still invoke it with the well-known shortcut of pressing and holding the Menu key (the one with the House pictogram).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is powered by a 600MHz CPU, which might sound inadequate in the world of Snapdragons, but it?s actually pretty good by Symbian standards. The UI is zippy and multitasking isn?t a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception is fine on the Nokia C5. The phone has good in-call sound quality with crisp sound. Vibration is also strong enough to make sure you never miss an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise was the smart dialing feature, which is usually reserved for the Eseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from our loudspeaker test are at your disposal - Nokia C5 turned out to be an average performer. Check out the table showing how it stacks up beside some of the handsets we've put to the same test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian handsets have an excellent phonebook with virtually unlimited capabilities. There is storage space for a practically unlimited number of contacts and fields with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal ringtones and videos can also be assigned to a contact. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization is also nice and easy although you do need the Ovi Suite for things to go smoothly. Sending and receiving contacts via SMS or Bluetooth is also a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log on the Nokia C5 is organized and efficient, typical Symbian. It holds up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enter the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 has great messaging capabilities. With a great keypad and solid software support, managing your correspondence is as good as it gets on this kind of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. Texts and MMS share an editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very similar to what previous Symbian powered phones have offered. The app can automatically detect the settings for over 1000 email service providers, all you have to do is enter your email address and password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we had some issues with it ? we had to enter the settings manually for our Gmail test account to get it working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for attachments, signatures and basically most of the things you can think of, so the Nokia C5 can meet almost any emailing needs. There?s even a preinstalled document viewer on the C5 so you can view attached office files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Contacts chats with Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts app comes preinstalled with Nokia C5 but you can also install it on most other Nokia smartphones. It integrates tightly with the Contact list and you can easily switch between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are synced with the Ovi cloud (along with calendar items and notes) and they can either be existing Ovi Contacts or G-Talk users (that?s Google?s own IM service, which is also integrated into Gmail).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts can also be used to share the name and artist info of the track you?re currently playing. Using the built-in GPS receiver, it can share your location too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you probably don?t have many contacts using Ovi for chat, chances are quite a few of them have a Gmail account and they can use that to chat with you. They could use iGoogle too or a desktop client like G-Talk. Multi-protocol clients can usually handle G-Talk too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that there is a dedicated IM which is also enabled for chats with Ovi and Gmail users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily for social network lovers, there are 4 applications allowing quick access to the services of Facebook, MySpace, hi5 and Friendster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A decent music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s little diversity in Symbian music players ? the one on the Nokia C5 is the exact same one found on XpressMusic devices (not that it?s a reason to complain in this case). It handles the most common audio formats - MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA, and packs a standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting your songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is worth noting that the C5 is supposed to play music up to 34 hours on a single charge ? we?re not surprised given the good performance of the 1050mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and, should they seem insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having seen how the Nokia 6700 slide performs, we simply expected that the Nokia C5 is an excellent musician. There are no weak points whatsoever in its audio output with all the readings being excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only area where we would ask for a bit more is the loudness level, as the C5 does unimpressive in terms of in-headphones volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C5 features Real player (as Symbian phones typically do). You can browse and watch your videos in the gallery, file manager and the Video Centre ? they?ll be handled by the Real player either way, the only difference will be in the layout and the browsing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a small screen though, video playback is not this phone's strongest suit. And to confirm that, you'll need to install a third-party player if you want some taste of DivX/XviD video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and Visual radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia C5 has a nice simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. RDS support is included and the Visual radio is also on-board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is the same as in N-Series phones and looks great. The speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of sorting out your memory card regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike, say, the Nokia N85, zooming here is very speedy, thanks to the zippy 600MHz processor. It does slow down a bit when you get over 100% but it will go up to 400% zoom. Zooming is done in small increments (about 10%) and panning is quite fast too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixels of fixed focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It has a LED flash but no lens protection whatsoever. This means that the glass covering the lens is prone to finger smudges and perhaps the occasional scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as settings go, the camera on C5 is limited, although it offers several scene presets, one of which is user defined. There's limited control over light sensitivity (it has low, medium, high and auto settings) as well as some control over sharpness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar on the right side of the screen hosts a set of shortcuts to various camera settings. You can add and remove shortcuts so you can have quick access to the settings that matter to you ? adding to a total of 16 viewfinder shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the settings include flash control, self-timer (2, 10, 20 seconds), night mode, automatic panorama mode and multi shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Sequence mode to let you capture consecutive images at a predefined interval (from 10 seconds to 30 minutes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously there aren?t any fancy features such as face and smile detection or dynamic range control. Sadly, there is no autofocus either (so, close-ups are a no-go for the C5). The image quality is good overall, with decent levels of detail for a 3MP shooter. There's little noise in well lit areas and the contrast is good. However, the sharpening algorithm gets overzealous, which results in artifacts, and there is some greenish tint on the photos as a result of wrong white balance settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the C5. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the Nokia C5 shoots in VGA resolution at 15 fps. Videos are MPEG-4 encoded. Although the specs sound decent, the quality is quite poor actually. The modest frame-rate takes the sizzle out of the high enough VGA resolution and makes the videos unsuitable for viewing on a larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfer options are numerous on the Nokia C5. Every common network data transfer medium is supported and so are USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. The C5 also packs an inbuilt GPS receiver and support for HSDPA and HSUPA. The only prominent absence is, sadly, Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a microSD card slot and it?s hot swappable ? even if quite tricky to actually pull the card out. We tested the Nokia C5 with a 16GB card and it worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audiophiles are in luck too: the C5 sports a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The browser is top but the screen is? flop<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet on the Nokia C5, like with all Nokia smartphones, is a pleasant experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around is a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser a point as it is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help you find your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level is also easily adjustable and searching for text on a page is straightforward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large amount of RAM (128MB in this case) is surely one of the best things that could happen to the browser, as it is clearly one of the most RAM-intensive applications. Now, even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background, you are extremely unlikely to run out of free RAM on the Nokia C5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser also has full support for Flash and Java so you should have no problem with this kind of content on the Internet. YouTube videos embedded in webpages can even be set to play fullscreen, which is a nice option since otherwise they rarely fit onto a QVGA screen. Since the C5 lacks an inbuilt accelerometer you?ll need to rotate the videos manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The setback of the Nokia C5 web browser is the small display. Only 2.2 inches means the smallest fonts aren't always readable and you have to go for larger ones. This in turn limits the amount of text that can fit on screen and will force you to scroll even more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia C5, like most other Symbian handsets, are really good. Just name the application and you can bet the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has five different types of view - monthly, weekly, daily, Agenda and To-do, and five types of events available for setting up ? Meeting, Meeting request, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well supported with preinstalled applications able to view Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files seamlessly. Editing documents is not supported out of the box, but hey, we're not talking Eseries here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application at the Nokia Download center. The final ingredient here is the included ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5 sports a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The Active Notes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set a huge number of alarms, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management options (which even include sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that the file manager can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard the Nokia C5. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to landmarks, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C5 features a dictionary with a very rich database. English comes pre-installed but you can also download dozens of other languages for free off the Nokia website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5 also comes with Ovi Files. You have to install the Ovi Files connector app on your computer but after you?re done, you can access all the files on that computer from your phone or a browser on another computer. You also get "Anytime files", which lets you store 10GB of data online that is accessible even if the computer is turned off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C5 comes with a GPS receiver and the Ovi Maps on board. You can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, and enjoy turn-by-turn voice guided navigation. The Nokia C5 gives you a free lifetime walk and drive navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the games, the Nokia C5 features two preloaded games, the well known Bounce Tales, and the Brain Challenge. Luckily, the Ovi Store is just a few clicks away and there you can find plenty of games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the Ovi Store, it?s easily accessible right off the phone as well as via a desktop browser. You can download the apps straight to your smartphone or transfer them later on from your desktop computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple ? the general view lists apps with their names and category, plus the price and stars rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, storage footprint plus reviews by people who have tried it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's pretty clear that we lost the geeks way back on page 1. Congratulations to all those of you who're still with us. We think we've got a phone for you. The Nokia C5 hasn't got all the features ever invented - it's the sensible buyer's choice. Performance within budget and a sense of style, the C5 is well on target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A device trying to redefine classic, the Nokia C5 is very well built and packs the smartphone punch. Take away the voice-guidance charges and it goes for pennies really. Adding Wi-Fi to the mix would have made it an excellent package, but alas, we're in no luck on that. Besides, web browsing on a small screen isn't great anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not forget though, this is a phone for users that aren't keen on jumping on the touchscreen bandwagon. The Nokia C5 is definitely a phone for them to consider. By the way, it's exactly the kind of handset Nokia are so good at making. The C5 compares much more favorably to rivals in its class than the Finnish touchphones so far. A brief look at the (few) Nokia C5 alternatives available should convince you about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is a compact bar-shaped phone that packs a 5 megapixel camera to make up for the lacking smartphone capabilities. It will even throw in WLAN to match up the free navigation on the C5. And the GreenHeart badge counts too we guess. The Elm however costs more than the C5. All in all, it's less bang for your buck unless you get a good carrier deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Elm</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's the camera performance of the Nokia C5 that bothers you, check out the Sony Ericsson C902. The Cyber-shot impressed us back in the day, but its screen is even smaller and there's neither GPS nor Wi-Fi. Still, the good build quality and the slim 10.5mm waistline makes it worth at least a second look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C902</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i7110 has it all: killer screen, imaging, media and a steel body. But it sure seems like ages that Samsung last made a phone like this. The i7110 never really caught on but it was pretty close to the ultimate of technology at that time. Sadly, it does look less likely to succeed on today's market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i7110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't look like Samsung are having big plans about Symbian at this point, even if they say they do. So, Nokia are preparing to have the non-touch Symbian market all to themselves. The Cseries are an important part of that. Phones like the C5 are taking over from the likes of Nokia E51. Eseries will continue to offer premium service while the C5 and the ones to follow will be smartphones for the masses.</paragraph>
