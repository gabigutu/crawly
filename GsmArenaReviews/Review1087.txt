			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, it's all but settled that Windows Phone 8 is the biggest thing to happen to smartphones this year. But are the handful of flagships carrying it the best thing that could happen to users?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Properly powered and engineered to perfection, the Nokia, Samsung and HTC WP8 smartphones are all making a bid to break iOS and Android's grip on the market. They are all fine species of smartphone. With the same screen resolution and chipsets powering them, with the Redmond-mandated hardware specs, they all have Microsoft written all over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then, it's only the Taiwanese that actually have it in writing. There's only one Windows Phone 8X - and it's the HTC Windows Phone flagship. Not a bad way to start now, is it? It must be quite a lift for the HTC Windows Phone 8X to feel special among clearly superior rivals. While Nokia and Samsung gave their WP top dogs those massive screens, HTC went for a relatively modest 4.3"? LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On one hand, it sounds like a smart move. The HTC Windows Phone 8X will be the only option for those looking for a more compact premium device that carries Microsoft's latest mobile platform. On the other, this could see the 8X relegated to a lower tier and made to fight it out with the likes of the Lumia 820. Now, that would call for some aggressive pricing and lower profit margins perhaps, which isn't exactly ideal for a company that hasn't had the best of streaks lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll see if the gamble pays off but there's no rush. Let's see what the HTC Windows Phone 8X is made of, and what could've been better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not a short list of disadvantages by any means, but most of those are platform-specific and, judging by the reception Windows Phone 8 has been getting, they're not deal-breakers. At least not all of them. Now, the non-expandable storage and the single 16GB option is something to definitely consider, but if you can live with that, the HTC Windows Phone 8X is a must-see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beats audio label has finally been made to count as the HTC Windows Phone 8X offers a specially designed amplifier, while the wide selection of available colors makes it easy to find a unit that best suits your personality. Whether you go for the businesslike black or one of those peppier paintjobs, the HD screen and beautiful unibody design are always part of the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that, as usual, is what we're going to start with.. Unboxing and hardware are coming up right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package covers the basics, little else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other than the handset itself and a few leaflets, the HTC Windows Phone 8X retail package contains the accessories needed to get you started. You get a wall-mount plug, which connects with the supplied microUSB cable to charge the phone, a set of headphones and a SIM eject tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Beats logo and the custom-made amplifier inside, you are not getting Beats headphones, which is a pity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Windows Phone 8X 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X looks super slim and is built to exceptional standards but we're sorry to say, its size was a source of disappointment. At 132.4 x 66.2 x 10.1 mm, it is just too big for a smartphone with this kind of screen. To put things in perspective, the Motorola RAZR M measures 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3 mm and packs a display of the same size. Not impressed? How about the HTC HD2 then? Three years ago it was a massive phone by the standards at the time. Now, that is more compact than the Windows Phone 8X, and it even had hardware keys - five of them, to be precise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really can't stress this enough - the whole point of having a device with a smaller screen is for it to be compact. The Windows Phone 8X is virtually the same size as a One X+ (the slimmer waistline offsets the subtle difference in width), which is quite a letdown. At least the 8X weighs 130g, which is far easier to swallow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The size out of the way, the HTC Windows Phone 8X is actually quite nice to look at. HTC are a back to what they do best - unibodies. Not that they ever gave them up - the brand is so much associated with the design that the unibody label is somewhat randomly applied even to some of their phones with detachable rear covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Windows Phone 8X is quite understated - there's nothing fancy along the lines of the HTC One S and its anodized ceramic coating. The WP 8X is quite like the One X - a little less premium feel perhaps but the same level of comfort and durability. The rubbery feel of the rear is quite nice to the touch and grippy. It looks good too and we really like the sloping edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC went for an LCD screen (which is rather good, mind you) and you can clearly tell where the screen ends and the bezel begins, which causes another minor issue. There are three different hues of black to be seen at the front: the lighter polycarbonate sides, the darker glossy bezel and the grayish-black background of the LCD screen. It's not too irritating, not at all, but it's no match for the borderless look of AMOLED on a black phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the thing is, the most important part of smartphone design is that it's functional. And while, the tapered edges contribute to the looks of the WP 8X, they may've been better off etched. It's pretty obvious too that the omission of a microSD card slot has something to do with the polycarbonate unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in conclusion, what we have with the HTC Windows Phone 8X is a cool looking smartphone, that doesn't serve its purpose - delivering the WP8 flagship experience in a compact body. Everyone is free picking their priorities, of course, but we are not too happy with the deal we got.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The set of controls on the HTC Windows Phone 8X should be pretty familiar - they are one of the essential Windows Phone requirements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the mandatory three-button combo and the Start, Back and Search keys are all capacitive this time. They have pleasant haptic feedback, which can be disabled if unneeded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the HTC Windows Phone 8X has the microSIM slot, the long and thin volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. The shutter key on the HTC WP 8X is pleasingly responsive with distinct half press. It will launch the camera even when the phone is locked and does so amazingly fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC WP flagship is completely bereft of controls and connectivity ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, you'll find the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the power key. The power/lock button is hard to locate by touch and stiff on press but the ergonomics aren't its only problem. This is by far not the most comfortable position for a power key in a phone of this height and we are not sure why HTC insists on placing it there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is the hardest place to reach when you hold the phone in one hand. We often found ourselves using two hands to just unlock the smartphone, which is far from perfect. Even the Galaxy Note II, with its monstrous 5.5"? screen is easier to wake up single-handedly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the HTC Windows Phone 8X hosts the microUSB port and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens is at the back, right next to the LED flash. The loudspeaker grill is all the way across, near the bottom of the nice looking back panel. We liked the faux metal finish of the Ativ S, when we reviewed it last week, but the polycarbonate unibody of the HTC Windows Phone 8X has it handily beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the HTC flagship loses some points, compared to its Samsung rival is the option to remove the battery cover and replace the battery. This means you are unable to carry a spare as a backup to the 1800 mAh unit inside the Windows Phone 8X, or replace the battery when it starts to show its age. The non-expandable memory on the HTC smartphone is another thing to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC doesn't give official numbers for the battery life but we ran our own tests. The HTC Windows Phone 8X proved to be rather disappointing in this department, mainly due to battery-hungry standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It did quite well in the talk time test with just over 11 hours and it got average scores in the web browsing and video playback tests, but the overall result was an endurance rating of 31 hours - one of the lowest we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can read more about the HTC 8X battery live in our blog post and if you're curious about how we do the tests, check out this article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X uses a 4.3" S-LCD2 display of 720p resolution. The modest diagonal combined with the high pixel count results in a Retina-beating density of 342ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual for HTC and its S-LCD units, the image quality here is nice with nice punchy colors and good contrast. It doesn't play as nice with the black backgrounds of WP8, but the Windows Phone 8X screen is still quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are splendid too - there's some color shift when you reach extremes, but whatever is on the screen remains legible at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Windows Phone 8X did in our dedicated display test. Its brightness came higher than that of the Ativ S, but understandably it wasn't able to match the infinite contrast of the Super AMOLED unit. What's a bit more puzzling is that the Windows Phone 8X didn't even manage to match the contrast of the HTC One X, despite sporting a second gen S-LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is good, if unspectacular - the S-LCD2 is rather reflective, so it can't really take proper advantage of its good brightness here.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to the software now - the Windows Phone 8 examination starts right after the break.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone 8 - so different, yet so familiar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 has seen many changes under the hood while retaining the "old" familiar look. The live tiles are still there, the lockscreen doesn't seem all that different and a swipe to the left on the homescreen will take to the endless scroll menu with all the phone's apps and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But inside it's the Windows Phone core that is brand new. Microsoft realized there is no way the developers invest into something so young and way different than Android and iOS. Instead Microsoft pump in the Windows Phone with tons of new features, they made it more powerful and developer-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of new useful and welcomed changes such as the USB mass storage mode, the Zune independence, the rich video codec support and the deeper Xbox Live integration. But what's really important here is the added support for new resolution modes, much wider hardware specs and DirectX graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the new power under the hood the developers have many new possibilities they could put into apps in a familiar way. And the DirectX graphics will do great for powerful games or even to revive some classics within your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X runs on a 1.5GHz dual-core Krait processor accompanied with Adreno 225 GPU and 1GB RAM. And while there are already quad-core Krait's with the more powerful Adreno 320 GPU this configuration is still powerful enough to be considered flagship material. And with an OS as light, we are sure it will do an excellent job for the current and even the future generation games and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. If you push the volume rocker (either + or -) you can bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be placed in the grid by tapping and holding down over an app and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles, an option also available with the latest WP 7.8 update. When you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can witch between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle, it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks exactly the same - there is no wallpaper, you can just choose between dark (black) and light (gray) background colors. Whatever you choose it will be the base color for every system app within the Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's a bit oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 offers multi-tasking as promised. It's not true multitasking always; most of the cases things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them. But just like the iOS, if an app requires to run in the background (navigation clients, players, communicators, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you frantically hit the back key it will start closing all of the open apps, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would like to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you ensured it with a password your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without that precious password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, however you protect your phone, you can't do nothing against accidental (or not) meetings with the floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Such a unified Notification area (or center if you will) would spare user the need to open up each app to see its corresponding notifications. Microsoft has expressed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub is the best phone/social book up to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People Hub remains untouched. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate), you can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is just chat rooms similar with the Skype group chats, but with contacts from your phonebook and social accounts. You can pin them to Start as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single photo. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen and for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test and the Windows Phone 8X score a good mark. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view works fine - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos (previously known as Pictures) hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported) or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X supports Beats Audio and you'll find the toggle deep in the settings menu, instead of the music player settings. Beats Audio boosts the volume without involving loss of quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the 8X now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it does recognize pretty much every Xvid, DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using AC3 audio codec. While this is not perfect, it's much better than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no subtitle support just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is Zune independent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen - like a song or video</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Judging the HTC Windows Phone 8X audio quality is a tricky job. HTC intended for you to listen to the smartphone with Beats audio enhancements enabled in which case the smartphone is one of the loudest around. The problem is enabling Beats also triggers an equalizer (which is otherwise unavailable and this means you won't be getting the pure experience audiophiles demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching Beats audio off still gives you good performance, but only average volume levels. Most of the readings are excellent remain good but the intermodulation distortion is slightly high and the stereo crosstalk is not the best we have seen either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bright, wide angle 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 8X is boasting an 8 MP camera, which HTC is keen to promote to users as among the most feature rich around. It's capable of producing stills with a resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels and has a single LED flash to assist it in low light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To further improve the low-light capabilities the HTC Windows Phone 8X offers a back-side illuminated sensor, which captures more light and a bright f/2.0 lens. For comparison the iPhone 5 and most of the other high-end smartphones offer a maximum aperture of f/2.4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC markets the Windows Phone 8X camera lens as 28mm wide (in 35mm equivalent) but we found it to be even wider. When put side by side with an Olympus Micro Four Thirds camera using a 14mm lens (28mm in 35mm equivalent), the HTC Windows Phone 8X is able to fit a lot more in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press - that is unlocking it, and start taking shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the HTC Windows Phone 8X doesn't do all that great when it comes to image quality. The camera is usually able to get the exposure right and has good contrast and dynamic range, but the amount of detail it captures is average and the noise levels are fairly high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This look a bit better in dimmer environments and the HTC Windows Phone 8X is able to climb up the pecking order in such conditions, but you shouldn't expect miracles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro shooting is another thing. The Windows Phone 8X can get really close and produces good results with impressive detail and really fast focusing. The physical shutter is a joy to use and is really improves the overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the Windows Phone 8X to be on par with the One X and it pretty much delivered. There are many similarities between the two cameras from processing to the amount of captured detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X shoots 1080p and 720p videos. In terms of detail we are pleased and focusing during video capture was overall snappy. But it's the automatic exposure that isn't up to scratch here. The Windows Phone 8X had trouble deciding what exposure to select and often times disregarded the bright sky resulting in blown up skylights and underexposed objects below it. Otherwise the videos are smooth and look especially good on the 4.3" screen of the Windows Phone 8X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bitrate for the 1080p video was a steady 21 Mbps while the framerate hovered around the 29 fps mark. Audio is recorded in mono, which is rather disappointing, given that the smartphone has two microphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 720p videos the bitrate fell to around 15 Mbps with the same 29 fps framerate. Audio is still mono with the same 100 kbps bitrate and 44 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p@30fps and 720p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Expanded connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and quad-band 3G with HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to recognize a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have let's say a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it in emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8X also has NFC connectivity, but the only app to use it is Wallet. Unfortunately we won't know if that has any potential to become actually useful for at least few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for webpages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer gets more powerful, keeps the old looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 brings got a major upgrade, but it kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't expect Flash support, there is none and Adobe has officially abandoned the mobile browsers. Silverlight doesn't work either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and advanced settings..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar. Unfortunately you can use only Bing as search provider, because using the URL bar as a search filed automatically redirects you to the Bing Search app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it does offer to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the HTC Windows Phone 8X to match the Samsung Ativ S performance in the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmark tests and it delivered. The smartphone actually did a little bit worse than its Samsung competitor, placing third spot in the JavaScript-centric SunSpider and failing even more miserably in BrowserMark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search is here to stay<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also offers song recognition and barcode scanner. The new feature here is Local Scout. Thanks to the dedicated app and its provided service, you can search for various points of interest near your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Bing does regular web searches for pages or images and can look for interesting locations nearby.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Store still has to catch up a lot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace, from now on called Store, is still playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. The number of apps available in there is higher than 100 thousand, but it's far less impressive than the Android and iOS. Since the Windows Phone 8 is different than its predecessor, it means the apps written on its native code won't work on the older versions. Bummer, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized into three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also from here you can see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Marketplace) or the app allowing you to change your avatar. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps is onboard, there is still no sign of navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) directions, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout is now a separate app from the Maps. It will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no pre-installed navigation software as expected, but we guess it's just because we got a pre-release unit and not the final one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The best looking office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab - this lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have included their HTC app, which went by the name HTC hub in previous Windows Phone releases. It gives you the weather and stocks information and you can select which cities to see and what companies to choose. It relies on Yahoo's services, just like Weather and Stocks on iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view news in various categories and choose the source you want to read from (e.g. CNN, BBC, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has seen better days in the smartphone market - we know this doesn't sound too good but somehow it has little to do with the quality of its devices. The company had solid offerings in the One X and the One S but it seems Samsung is better at making money off of Android. On the other hand, HTC has been getting along with Microsoft for as long as we can remember, so Redmond could once again help it get the show back on the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the competition will have its say of course and the Windows Phone competition is not what it used to be in the PocketPC days. Nokia and HTC have been having quite an entertaining  exchange  lately. Microsoft is not making things easier by calling the Windows Phone 8X a signature device, whatever that means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may look like Microsoft is married to Nokia and having an affair with HTC. The HTC Windows Phone 8X is the one that's a few years and a few pounds younger, so nothing quite out of the ordinary. But at the end of the day, being able to challenge the Lumia 920 is currently HTC's biggest hope of being relevant again, in smartphone terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the looks of it, the HTC Windows Phone 8X fails to achieve what it sets out to. A more compact and a more affordable package without compromising the overall experience is what we were hoping for, but in the end we got a phone of similar size to the Ativ S and Lumia 920 with a much smaller screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some will say that the voice-guided navigation of the Nokia Lumia 920 and its PureMotion HD+ screen alone are enough to justify the difference in price tags, Lumia's vastly superior low-light camera performance a nice thing to have on the side. And unless the weight of the Lumia 920 is a major turn-off (the Finn weighs more than a Galaxy Note II), we're willing to agree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even if the Lumia 920 is out of your budget, the HTC Windows Phone 8X will still have a hard time competing. The Samsung Ativ S offers 25% more screen estate, a microSD card slot, a replaceable (and larger) battery and a better camera for just a few extra bucks. Not to mention the fact that Windows Phone just looks better on AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Ativ S I8750</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the HTC Windows Phone 8X will probably end up hitting way lower and competing with the Lumia 820. Nokia's mid-range device has AMOLED technology, a more compact body, a microSD card slot, LTE connectivity and easy customization through the replaceable covers. The Lumia 820 is slightly cheaper than the Windows Phone 8X too, but the lower-res screen might be the deal breaker here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 820</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're still not quite sure about Windows Phone and you're going to wait for a notification area of some sort, or for some of your favorite apps to make it to the platform, Android is always an option. The Samsung Galaxy S III and the upcoming HTC One X and LG Optimus G are all viable alternatives that cost about the same as the HTC Windows Phone 8X, while offering vastly superior hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III &#x2022; HTC One X &#x2022; LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems the Windows Phone 8X by HTC finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. The Microsoft-powered competition and Android flagships are putting pressure it cannot quite handle. That said - it's not too late for HTC to take one of the escape routes and emerge unscathed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The easiest solution is a price cut - it won't really help the bottom line, but it will let the company save face and buy them some time to regroup and mount another challenge to the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A harder task would be to try and market what they have at the current price. After all, the smartphone still has the great build quality, the light weight and the wide array of available colors going for it, so some good marketing can probably do wonders for it. A bunch of cool new HTC apps supplied through an update may come in handy too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third workaround are carriers - if HTC manage to get good deals on their smartphone, then the day is saved. Early indications from the US aren't positive, but Nokia had to go full exclusive to achieve that, so maybe there's still hope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're eager to try something new Windows Phone 8 is a great place to be, especially, if Android or iOS are on the way of becoming a habit you want to break. There's plenty about the HTC Windows Phone 8X to like. It has that immediate appeal that many buyers will appreciate - it's slim and colorful, a smooth performer and a perfect blend of style and personality. It's a smartphone you'd want to show off. It's a smartphone too that you'd love to use, but one that involves some compromise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wouldn't go as far as saying that HTC's plan to position it as the premium compact alternative has backfired, but the Windows Phone 8X isn't quite the Windows phone to deliver the best experience on the market.</paragraph>
