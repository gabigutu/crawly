			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer may be new to the smartphone game but they?re learning fast. On paper, the Acer Stream has all the right ingredients to tackle the HTC Desire and the Nexus One. With much stronger emphasis on multimedia than the titular Google phone, the Acer Stream has a few aces up its sleeve and isn?t afraid to play them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer dabbled in customizing Android with the Liquid, but their first attempts were far from impressive. Packing the latest version of Acer?s custom Android UI, the Stream is a completely different story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won?t spoil the surprise ? the changes run pretty deep and we can?t summarize them in one paragraph anyway. But don?t be too quick to skip straight to the User interface chapter of this review. The hardware has a few cool things in store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtle small-font labels leave no doubt about the multimedia prowess of the Acer Stream. The 5MP camera can capture 720p videos and you?ll also spot the Dolby Mobile logo, which promises great sonic experience. But if you?re not careful you might miss the HDMI label right next to the microUSB port. That?s right, the Acer Stream has a microHDMI port to deliver HD video to compatible external displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the list of pros and cons, for the most impatient readers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dedicated multimedia keys are less than essential perhaps in a touch phone but they serve a different purpose here. They are a promise for some serious media capabilities ? a promise the Acer Stream intends to keep. Putting media aside for a moment, there are no obvious omissions from the spec sheet compared to other top droid rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Snapdragon ticking at 1GHz with 512MB RAM to work with should give the Acer Stream all the speed to keep up. And it?s got the shape too. Compared to the Liquid, Acer have managed to shave off a few millimeters off the Stream ? they?ve gotten it down to only 11.2mm if thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Get ready to hit the Play button folks, we could use some tunes while examining the hardware up close.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream retail package is one well stuffed Christmas stocking. The supplied charger has a changeable plug. There?s only one suited for the relevant market, but if you buy other plugs you won?t need travel adapters. The box also contains the usual one-piece headset, a data cable and manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re delighted to find some valuable goodies inside too: an 8GB microSD card with an SD adapter (which combined with the 2GB built-in memory makes for 10GB, not bad), and a microHDMI cable for pairing your Acer Stream to an HDTV. This is more than welcome since these are much rarer than regular HDMI cables.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last but not least, there?s a carrying case in the box as well. It?s not leather or anything fancy, but it will still do a good job of protecting the screen and camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an unboxing video we did recently:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Stream 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The overall shape of the Acer Stream is just how we like it ? big high-res touchscreen (3.7?, WVGA) and slender frame. Measuring in at 119.5 x 63 x 11.2 mm it?s about as big as the other 3.7? Snapdroids out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 140 grams of weight, it?s not the lightest around but part of that weigh comes from the stylish metal frame around the display. Anyway, the Stream is pretty standard fare when it comes to big touchscreen phones and portability isn?t an issue.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like all touch phones, the Acer Stream is designed around the screen. There?s a metal edge running around the display?s covering glass. It?s not much but it does improve the feel of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s more to it than pure looks. The display glass holds the standard four Android keys: the Home key is an actual button, the other three are capacitive. The metal frame in turn is where the multimedia keys are placed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia keys are at the very bottom of the phone, so they?re not too comfortable to use when holding the phone upright. But when you turn the phone landscape everything clicks into place. They are much more comfortable to use with your thumb, even when you?re holding the phone in one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape mode, the Acer Stream makes a pretty credible multimedia player. And a good multimedia player needs a good screen ? the Stream boasts a 3.7? AMOLED capacitive touchscreen at 480 x 800 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED screen has some issues though. It?s dim even at the brightest setting and the contrast is disappointing. Images appear washed out ? certainly not as vivid as you?d expect on an AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, under direct sunlight the display becomes near illegible. This is a common AMOLED flaw, made worse here by the low screen brightness in this particular case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the touchscreen is generally good, though we suspect the software is not very well tuned. The screen can register very light taps, but it takes quite long swipes to detect the gesture ? and the custom Acer UI uses thumb sweeps a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the four standard Android keys. The Home key is physical and easy to find by touch. It?s flush with the screen glass but it?s nice and solid to press. The other three keys are capacitive and give haptic feedback (actually, the Home key is haptic enabled as well). The Home key acts as a notification light too, pulsing in white to alert of new system events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the Android controls are the three media keys. Nothing surprising here ? a play/pause button in the center, skip keys at the sides. As we said earlier, they are not comfortable to use when holding the phone vertically (say, changing the currently playing track, but they?re pretty good for watching landscape videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we?re on the topic of keys, let?s discuss the controls on the sides of the Acer Stream. There?s the power/hold key, the volume rocker on the left and the shutter key on the right. They are all thin knobs ? quite thin really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s OK for the power/hold key, it should not take accidental presses. But having a shutter key that?s barely bigger than the hold key is no good ? especially when you need to half-press it to lock focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone also features the microUSB and micro HDMI ports. They are covered by a single plastic flap. The micro HDMI port looks a lot like the microUSB port and it?s just as easy to plug the cable in. The supplied cable is micro HDMI on one end and the other is the more popular regular HDMI. The port can output photos and videos at up to 720p resolution to a HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Stream only hosts the 3.5mm audio jack. The bottom is sparsely populated too ? there?s just the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. Right next to the camera, there?s a secondary microphone for video recording. There?s only one loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is unprotected, so the carrying case comes in handy if you want to prevent scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the rear cover, but you need to remove the battery itself to access it. The battery is a 1400mAh unit, which is said to keep the phone going for 400 hours of standby or up to 5 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Acer Stream is great and the metal frame makes it seem even sturdier. It?s also very good at hiding fingerprints, as is the matte plastic on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we don?t have any issues with the build quality, we question some of the design decisions. Not being able to hot-swap the microSD card is one thing, the uncomfortable shutter key is very disappointing too. The media keys make sense in landscape mode but design-wise they make the front panel somewhat too overcrowded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the Acer Stream is very well made and looks quite attractive without being too flashy. It feels comfortable both in the hand and in the pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer?s custom job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The thoroughly customized user interface is what we like most about the Acer Stream. But you don?t have to agree ? Acer have done well to give users a choice. You can opt between Acer UI and Android UI. Switching to and from any of the two available interface styles requires a reboot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream runs Android 2.1 E'clair and if you choose to work with the standard Android UI there will be no surprises. There are five homescreen panes to populate with shortcuts, widgets and folders. Task management and notifications are the usual good Android stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically, the differences to other Eclair-powered phones are minor. The only thing to note is perhaps some of the Acer home-made widgets. We like the Media player and the Web player for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, if you decide to give the Acer UI a try prepare for a whole new experience. And just so you know ? we liked it for the most part. Knowledge of the standard Android OS will help you find your way around the Touch 3D UI v4.0 of course. But it?ll take a while for you to start feeling at home. Everything has been rearranged: Lockscreen, main menu and the Notification bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our demo video that will give you a primer on the UI:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing you?ll notice on the homescreen is the list of shortcuts placed at the bottom of the screen. Acer call it an Application dock and we find it quite a smart solution. Pulling up the Application Dock is the only way to display the customized launcher ? the Acer Stream?s main menu. Below the Application dock you?ll find three side-scrollable screens with application icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Icons can be dragged between the Application Dock and the actual launcher. In effect you can have a mini launcher visible on the homescreen at all times. The Application Dock can store up to eight icons to frequently used features. You can choose to have no icons on the Application dock ? drag them all back down to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This isn?t something we would do though. All you get is a neater homescreen but you can?t use the blank space, which is pointless. And by the way, getting rid of the Application Dock will also affect how you work with the notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification bar is right above the Application dock ? that?s the middle of the screen, not top as you might expect. Otherwise, it?s the usual thin strip with indicators for signal strength, battery status, missed calls, etc. There is also a small clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on it will display the notification area with info about recently installed applications, missed events, time and date as well as switches for turning on or off the Airplane mode, GPS receiver, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, etc. This is also one of the ways to get to the alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper half of the homescreen displays a large clock with the date right underneath. This part of the screen is side scrollable: a swipe to the right will display the recently used apps. The so called Application history is a stack of thumbs of applications. A swipe to the left will take you to the Media panel. It hosts your images, songs and videos which are displayed as Cover-Flow-like thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set both the Application history and the Media panel to show or hide depending on your personal preferences. The same goes for the large clock on the homescreen, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to music, you can make the current song?s album art replace the wallpaper on your homescreen. Sadly, you can?t use it to get back to the minimized music player. However, you can always swipe to the right and go to the Application History where you?ll find the music player among the other recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And where have all the widgets gone?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Widgets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, those are not quite where you?d expect them to be. The Acer Stream?s lockscreen serves as an extended homescreen to fill with widgets. And it?s widgets only ? no shortcuts or folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen consists of five panes ready to accommodate a large number of status widgets or mini apps. When the phone is locked the controls are not working but the screen can be scrolled and the widgets can actually be pressed. It all makes sense ? and there?s little to no chance to get the phone accidentally unlocked in your pocket or bag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, tapping on a widget won?t launch the respective app ? you?ll only see a pop-up prompting you to unlock the phone by an upward slide. It?s pretty safe. Status widgets like weather or My Location have tiny update buttons. You can update the widget and get the latest status without unlocking the phone. Music player widgets have equally tiny play, pause and skip knobs ? the nemoPlayer even has volume controls. You can listen to music without unlocking the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To customize the five panes of the Lockscreen you need to press and hold the Home key. The lockscreen is then accessible in edit mode, with an Add Widget button on each of the panes. This is one of the major differences between the Acer UI and the standard Android interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing and holding the Home key will not bring the regular task switcher on if you?re using the Touch 3D interface. But you don?t need this ? you have the application history a swipe away on the Homescreen at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the user interface seems quite different at first but after a few days with the phone you?ll get to appreciate the Acer Touch 3D UI v4.0 for not only being colorful but pretty user-friendly as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Clash of the Titans<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ran the usual benchmarks on the Acer Stream and weren?t really surprised to see it get some pretty impressive scores. It?s close enough to some of the most powerful smartphones on the market such as the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S, the HTC Desire and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First-class phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream?s phonebook is spacious and detailed. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding an IM nickname to the contact is an option too, as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of details you can assign to each contact, but it all remains perfectly in order. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right. Hitting it will add another item of that type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, the various details are displayed in portions. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contact listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the ones for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy ? just hit the virtual search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dialing, yey!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Acer Stream we had no reception blank spots, and sound during calls was admirable. Telephony is now enhanced by Smart dialing. In the Android OS the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. Still it's quite convenient to be able to search for a contact straight from the dialing pad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the Stream managed to snatch an average score. Here is how it stacks against some of the other devices we?ve tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging made simple<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department is quite straightforward and simple at first glance. There are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long ? under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like with the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which shows the number of available characters as well as number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since even if you hide the keyboard, the text box still has the same small part of the screen to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the desired name or number and choose from the suggestions offered. The list of recipients is displayed by name too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. There are no "undelivered messages" anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can tap and hold on it to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a new incoming message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications ? including email, notes, chats, etc. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have added any media content to a text message, it is automatically converted into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor if the need arises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the Gmail functionality, we really like the batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. Sadly, the emails are not displayed in threads like those in Gmail, but you still have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with some popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: power and eye-candy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we enter the gallery, let's take a look at Acer's Media Server app first. With its help you can define which type of multimedia (video, photo, and music) will be shared when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos located in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the name is the number of items stored in that folder. Each sub-gallery has a thumbnail, which displays either the latest image (if the folder contains less than four images) or four thumbs if there are at least four files in this folder. There is no way to change these viewing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the main Gallery a dedicated camera button allows you to start recording videos or capture images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the option to mark multiple images for mass delete but you can't copy or cut more than one file at a time. Scrolling thumbs of images up and down is very smooth and quick. Caching images may take quite a while when you open the gallery for the first time, but once that's done they load almost instantaneously' even if a folder contains thousands of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To zoom in and out you can either use the two dedicated buttons in the top right corner or the well-known pinch gesture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two video players and above average codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you already know, the Acer Stream has a microHDMI port as well as a compatible cable supplied in the retail box. The HDMI output is only activated when you view photos or videos in the preinstalled Nemo multimedia player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open supported content, a pop-up appears prompting you to switch to the external screen. And there you are. By the way, keep in mind that the phone?s own display automatically goes blank once you switch to external screen which is kind of confusing but nothing you can?t get used to. The only controls available in this mode are the hardware multimedia keys below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stream features two players you could use to watch videos - the nemoPlayer and the stock Android player accessible through the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for the second option, you?ll face an app with a very simple interface - videos are played in landscape mode. We couldn?t get any of the DivX videos to run 720p XviD had no problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nemoPlayer is meant for video, music and images and boasts a cooler interface. You can access the nemoPlayer from the menu or just use the dedicated nemoPlayer widget. Strangely, the so-called Media panel starts the nemoPlayer as well, so it's just another option to get to your videos, songs or images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player has been slightly redone. The four large buttons are now gone. They have been replaced by four tabs which do the same thing as those buttons. They organize your music collection by artist, album, song or displaying the playlists you've created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream features the Dolby Mobile technology which replaces the missing equalizer settings. The effect can only be heard in headphones, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has the nice feature to quickly look up a song in YouTube or run a Google search by holding down a finger on a song. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabet scroll that appears on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing though (for example, there are still no alternative visualizations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't be publishing audio quality analysis for the Acer Stream just yet since the marketing sample we have is incapable of playing back stereo sound properly. We're sure though that Acer will fix that in the retail version and we'll try to update this part of the review if and when we get a retail testing unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream has an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many stations as you wish as favorites. You can also record radio broadcasts or listen to the radio on the loudspeaker (the headset is still needed, though).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera scores five? on a one to ten scale<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is really simple. Start the camera and you get a viewfinder with three icons on the side (still camera, camcorder and gallery) along with the zoom slider at the bottom. To get to the settings you'll have to tap on the viewfinder or the menu button. It brings up some more options: Resolution, White balance, Brightness, Timer and Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings submenu lists Geotagging, Macro and Anti-Shake switches, ISO, effects, exposure, picture quality and contrast options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality however is not even close to the best in the 5MP league. The resolved detail seems not enough, but this is not our main concern. Every image has a prominent magenta tint and the colors look way off. This is perhaps fixable with a fairly advanced image editor, but we usually expect those things to be sorted in the camera itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed that sometimes the pictures are out of focus around the edges. Some of these issues can perhaps be blamed on the pre-market status of our unit ? they may be sorted in the retail version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Acer Stream. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream claims membership in the elite club of mobile phones that shoot 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 1280 x 720 pixel resolution at 24 fps. The actual videos are far from compelling though. The amount of resolved detail is obviously below 720p standards ? it barely suits WVGA videos. The clips have very high noise levels and are out of focus in most cases. Continuous auto-focus is still a luxury for mobile phones and we don?t expect it in every other handset we test but the focusing routine of the Acer Stream is obviously flawed leading to bad focus lock in most videos. The magenta tint we observed in the still images is noticeable here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to make the things worse, the videos are stored in 3GP format with heavy compression and lots of visible artifacts. There are quite a few dropped or doubled frames too and videos appear unpleasantly choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we are not happy with the Acer Stream?s video recording at all. With an HDMI port on board and hardware that?s powerful enough, it?s a shame Acer didn?t get the actual video capturing right. That would be one of the things to fix with an upcoming update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some video samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a full untouched  720p video sample by the Acer Stream.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Premium connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream has an excellent connectivity set. The phone is worldwide roaming ready with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA. Download rates are up to 7.2 Mbps, with up to 2.0 Mbps upload speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream also offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier. Android 2.1 enables file transfers via Bluetooth, so there?s little else left to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of its 2GB integrated storage, the Acer Steram supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. The slot is under the battery cover, next to the battery and is not hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A micro HDMI port is there to deliver photos and videos in up to 720p to compatible devices and a proper HDMI cable comes in the retail box. However the HDMI output is only activated only when you open a photo or a video from within the preinstalled Nemo video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open supported content, a pop-up appears prompting you to switch to the external screen. Just bear in mind that when the phone is paired to a TV over HDMI its screen goes blank. The only controls available in this mode are the hardware multimedia keys below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Stream hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Acer Sync software you can easily sync your Stream's calendar and contacts with your computer (the over-the-air syncing option with your Google account is still there, as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RoadSync applications, which also come preinstalled, use the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync protocol to provide push synchronization of your emails, contacts and calendar to any other standard Exchange ActiveSync server.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typical Eclair web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is the product of the Web 2.0 era and its browser is excellent. With Eclair, the level of usability has already reached competitive levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalistic (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and +/- zoom buttons. The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls auto-hide ? that?s essential for web apps because they need to have the whole screen estate to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stream?s browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and the multi-touch pinch zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow is enabled ? as soon as you set the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark view shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked pages and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last castle of the Web that the Android Browser has yet to storm is Flash. It?s only with Froyo that it?s finally available in the core Android system. It?s still not clear whether Acer Stream will get that upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream relies on the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but those are out of Stream?s reach for now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Stream comes with the Documents To Go viewer preinstalled, which handles diverse kinds of office documents (including PDF files). The editor comes for a fee, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, which makes viewing attachments easy. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them on the phone memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate, not having a document viewer out of the box is a disadvantage for a high-end smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is also integrated with the new status bar and offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks app does what it says: you can easily create and modify a list of tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big and comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream features a decent alarm clock application, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms app has a new Desk Clock mode for use with a desktop dock. It offers the usual stuff ? wallpaper with date and time, battery and a few shortcuts to alarms, gallery, player and menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stream also comes with a simple Voice Recorder.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A handful of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at the set of pre-installed applications on the Acer Stream.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer's Media Server app helps you define which type of multimedia (video, photo, and music) will be shared when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MusicA is a useful music recognition app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Barcode scanner needs no explanation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream also has Facebook and Twitter (Twidroid) clients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a urFooz app that lets you design your own avatar and chat and exchange photos, videos or bookmarks with friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another app that caught our attention was the media-streaming Spinlets. You can use it to listen to music, browse images or visit your favorite artists' web sites.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is the place to get even more apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of apps in the market is ever growing and a recent survey showed that it has the highest free-to-paid apps ratio out of all the app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists subcategories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. Do keep an eye on this tab ? when updates become available for an app you?ve installed, a label shows up next to the app name to notify you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications range from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell), through fun (e.g. a virtual guitar) to real must-have's (including task killers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream?s GPS receiver got a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS will speed this up quite a bit, but data charges may apply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without proper drive navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Stream doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's getting nasty at the top of the Android league. A bunch of big bad Snapdroids jostling for the pole position isn't quite the company you want to be in. Unless, of course, you're a big bad Snapdroid yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not like Acer didn't know where it's going and we think they deserve credit for the courage to try. Their Stream will be running against some of the most compelling devices on today's market. Acer is a brand with solid credentials but on this one they will be competing against the best in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are the standard-setter for multimedia in mobile phones and HTC made the first Android device. That should be enough to grasp the scale of the challenge for Acer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how are they handling it? Not bad at all actually - and that was a pleasant surprise. The handset looks good - we wouldn't call it hot but the Stream is mature and convincing. The well-stocked retail package is quite tempting too. 1GHz Snapdragon, 512MB RAM and ROM with 2GB of additional inbuilt storage, a 3.7" AMOLED WVGA touchscreen - these are all the right ingredients to put the Acer Stream up there with the best Android phones. Not to mention it is likely to handle further upgrades (Froyo, Gingerbread) with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home-brewed UI is a solid custom job. Acer was in a mood to experiment it seems and the end result is quite positive. The Touch 3D UI was a nice surprise compared to the Acer Liquid, which barely tried to customize the Android interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Acer wanted to make sure their top Android phone doesn't feel underdressed and underpowered among celebrities. There's some impressive competition waiting and success isn't simply a matter of features and performance - it very much depends on how the phone will be marketed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I9000 Galaxy S is Samsung's most powerful Android smartphone and perhaps the most popular droid lately. The breathtaking four inches of Super AMOLED display is the most compelling feature, but the solid 5-megapixel still imaging, generous inbuilt storage of 8/16GB, DivX/XviD support and high-res video recording make it a powerful multimedia machine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 has the older Donut (Android OS v1.6) and its price is steep. The X10 is still quite a catch though. It has a Snapdragon inside and a bigger screen too. The real edge over the Android rivals however is the 8-megapixel autofocus camera and the unique TimeScape UI. If the Android Donut is your only concern, you should know the ?clair update is on the way (along with 720p video recording update).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently launched Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is the QWERTY-less sibling of the original MILESTONE. Typing is not its forte but imaging is quite impressive. The XT720 has an 8 megapixel camera with xenon flash, 720p video recording at 24 fps and an HDMI port. The screen resolution equals the XPERIA X10, but the processor is slightly underclocked - a 720MHz ARM A8 Cortex.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE XT720</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Eclair pioneers - the Google Nexus One and the HTC Desire - are still big enough to upset the cocky newcomer. Both devices boast AMOLED screens, 1GHz Snapdragon processors, 5 megapixel cameras and the latest Froyo upgrades enable 720p video recording. The Desire should be a bit cheaper than the Acer Stream already and has even greater customization with the HTC Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire ? Google Nexus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there is a long enough list of potential enemies and the Stream will have to tick all the boxes to stay afloat. There is enough in this phone to entice users we think but it's obvious Acer still have some catching up to do. Android is already probing the 8 megapixel boundaries, while the Stream isn't anywhere near convincing in the imaging department. Its AMOLED screen is below the usual standards and the HDMI output has its limitations. Although we liked the Acer 3D UI, it still isn't as elaborate and deep-reaching as HTC's Sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's be fair here. Acer was only recently feeling the Android water, now they're swimming with the sharks. The rate at which they're evolving compares to the speed at which the Android market share is growing. Acer would've been stupid not to want a piece. Phones like the Stream show the company won't simply play along - it will try and make a splash out of their Stream.</paragraph>
