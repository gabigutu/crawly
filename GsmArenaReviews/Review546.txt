			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung?s freshly announced Gear S2 smartwatch has piqued our interest ever since we caught a first glimpse of its circular display and sleek UI several months ago. The Tizen OS wearable device made made a brief cameo at the Samsung Galaxy Note5 launch event last month, followed by its official debut a couple of days ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available in classic and sportier guise, Samsung Gear S2 is a massive improvement over last year?s Samsung Gear S in terms of design and functionality. With a fully circular Super AMOLED display and rotating bezel that controls a sleek new UI, the newcomer carries an aura of desirability which none of its predecessors possessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a manner typical for a high-end Samsung device, the 1.2? circular Super AMOLED unit in the Gear S2 family promises one of the best screens in its segment. The Snapdragon 400 chipset on the other hand, promises smooth performance - it is an established smartwatch industry standard by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In charge of navigating the sleek Tizen UI, the rotating bezel of the Gear S2 is an innovative and convenient solution. At 2-3 days, the quoted battery life of the device of the non-3G version looks impressive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly, the Gear S2 smartwatch, unlike past Gear iterations, is now available to Android devices other than Samsung. This step by the Korean manufacturer promises to make its latest and greatest wearable more successful than any of its predecessors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Gear S2 is the more casual member of the family. Available with optional 3G network connectivity, the smartwatch features stainless steel body and swappable silicone band with proprietary connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two color schemes available - silver and gray with black or white silicon band respectively. Of course, Samsung will offer interchangeable bands in a variety of colors as additional accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Physical measures of the Gear S2 are 42.3 × 49.8 × 11.4mm, while its weight tips the scale at 47 grams. The 3G variant is slightly bulkier due to its bigger battery and e-SIM card - it measures 44.0 x 51.8 x 13.4mm and 51 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bundled silicone band of the smartwatch is comfortable and easy to maintain. Because it doesn?t require standard lugs, it is seamlessly integrated into the body of the smartwatch, thus offering a sportier, slightly futuristic look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality of the Gear S2 is excellent. The device?s body is crafted from stainless steel, so it promises to hold up well against daily wear and tear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.2? circular Super AMOLED screen of the smartwatch is excellent. It offers punchy colors, coupled with infinite contrast levels and stellar brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung?s innovative rotating bezel has pleasant ?clickiness? to it and is a joy to use. It rotates in both directions, thus allowing you to easily navigate the Tizen OS of the Gear S2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A magnetic charging dock is tasked with charging the device. Using it is a simple and straightforward process.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S2 Classic hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Gear S2 classic is the ?mature? member of the smartwatch family. The device features more compact stainless steel body and standard 20mm genuine leather strap out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S2 classic has a black stainless steel body with glossy finish. With measures of 39.9 × 43.6 × 11.4mm and a weight of 42 grams, it is considerably more elegant than the regular Gear S2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of its more traditional appearance, Samsung Gear S2 classic can be easily worn with a business attire. The presence of standard 20mm lugs on the other hand, allows users to change the look of the smartwatch depending on the occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the regular S2, the classic model has etched bezel for a more distinctive look. We found it to be just as easy to operate as that of the non-classic model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display and performance of the Gear S2 classic are identical with those of the regular variant. The same goes for the battery life of the smartwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pricing of the Samsung Gear S2 family is yet to be revealed, but we expect the classic to carry a premium over the regular model. Considering its timeless design and standard 20mm bands, we reckon that the higher price tag will be well worth it.</paragraph>
