			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Asha is back for another round of bargain basement action and we find ourselves wondering how much cheaper it can get. Most of the time it makes sense to be skeptical of the lowest bidder but we've found the Finns' budget lineup to be efficient and dependable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, cheap it is. And although there're lots of bad ways to be cheap, the Nokia Asha 200 seems to get it right. It's a QWERTY messenger with dual-SIM support. There isn't a whole lot more to it than that - but Nokia are getting ready to sell big. You don't offer eight - repeat, eight - paintjobs unless you anticipate huge demand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 is two phones in one and we don't mean the dual SIM support only. The Asha 200 is literally made out of a couple of fairly recent Nokia handsets. And it's pretty obvious which two ended up in the blender. The Nokia X2-01 provided the S40 interface and QWERTY keyboard, while the dual SIM support and colorful bodywork is courtesy of the x1-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we'll have to do without one or two things that are otherwise taken for granted in contemporary phones. But the omissions shouldn't be hard to forgive in a phone that costs next to nothing. 3G and Wi-Fi are available elsewhere in the Asha lineup, and so is touchscreen. The Asha 200 focuses on the basics instead - with value-for-money features like dual SIM and a QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dual SIM QWERTY messenger pretty much sums the Nokia Asha 200. But it comes in plenty of colors and is not entirely clueless when it comes to music, social networks and even some basic photography. Of course, shoppers on a budget have priorities and build quality and durability are usually high on their list. They should look no further than the next page where we explore the hardware of the Asha 200.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Asha 200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 200 comes packaged with the most basic stuff only - a typical Nokia charger and a single piece headset. There is no USB cable or a microSD card inside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 200 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 200 is 115 mm tall and 61mm wide, more than reasonably sized for a QWERTY messenger. It's quite chubby actually at 14 mm, but the comfortably curved back feels nice in the hand. The phone weighs just 105g and is entirely made of plastic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 is finished in glossy plastic except the matte frame that runs around the entire body and accommodates the secondary SIM and memory card slots. The graphite version that we're testing is quite prone to fingerprints but they're not that easily noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other color versions of the Asha 200 may do even better at hiding smudges although they don't seem to skimp on gloss either. Anyway, it's an impressive selection of paintjobs with a color for every taste, from classic, through youthful to feminine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, a 2.4" QVGA display and a four-row QWERTY keyboard are separated by a navigation deck, built around the usual D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" QVGA screen is probably the best we could've hoped for in a basic feature phone. It offers more than decent sunlight legibility nonetheless, with good contrast and viewing angles. Colors could've been punchier and graphics smoother, but overall the screen quality is passable. Unfortunately the Asha 200 doesn't have any kind of brightness control, so we ran our brightness test at 100% brightness only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find only the earpiece. There's no ambient-light sensor on the Nokia Asha 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the navigation deck, complete with a D-pad and the usual soft keys, call buttons and shortcuts to SIM management and messaging. The flat call keys and the shortcut buttons are conveniently separated by thin plastic ridges. The D-pad is reasonably sized and very responsive. The two vertical knobs of the soft keys did feel a bit awkward at first- we're used to them being level and right beneath the screen. On the other hand, they're the most prominent controls in the layout and very sold to press too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different finish makes the QWERTY keyboard stand out against the surrounding glossy surface. Well-defined and comfortably convex buttons offer great tactility and reasonable typing speeds. The numpad is centrally placed and you can assign speed dial to the number keys 2 to 9. The backlighting is impressively sharp and solid as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia Asha 200 is completely bare, while the right is quite busy. It accommodates the microSD slot and the secondary SIM compartment. Both slots are hot-swappable and you can replace cards at any time, no phone reboot required. If you want to use just one SIM card with the Asha 200 it has to be inside the phone and not in the outside slot. Both slots are sealed with thin plastic lids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 supports dual SIM standby, meaning the two phone lines can work independently. For the SIM2 to work though, a SIM needs to be inserted in the master compartment under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no dedicated volume control on the device, you'll have to use the D-pad instead during calls or when playing music or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top there's a 3.5mm audio jack, along with a microUSB port and the 2mm Nokia charger plug. The Asha 200 doesn't have USB charging enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing of note at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom half of the all glossy battery cover has a bit of see-through finish revealing a mesh pattern underneath the solid base color. There are only two things of interest at the back - the 2MP camera lens on the top and the loudspeaker grille at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover feels quite solid - the thick piece of plastic fits perfectly in place, producing no squeaks when handling the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is the 1430mAh BL-5J battery, which is quoted at the impressive 552h (that's 23 days) of standby and 7 full hours of talk time. If you turn the network off you should squeeze up to 52h of continuous music playback. We can't confirm those numbers, but we've never had worries with phones like the Asha 200. We should note too that it's a considerable upgrade over the 1020 mAh battery of the X2-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 doesn't get fancy with the finish - it comes in a rich selection of colors instead. The design is simple but the good build should rate higher in an entry level handset. The Asha 200 has a comfortable QWERTY keyboard and the general hand feel is quite good. It's a dual SIM phone and the hot-swappable SIM is a major point in favor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Series 40, no touch included<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 is running Series 40 and is going back to basics with hardware input only. Visually, the main difference is that some UI elements have been reduced due to the lack of need for thumbability and what you're left with is Nokia's well known for many people landscape oriented touchless interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons have been reworked to match Symbian Anna's appearance, which is refreshing when compared with devices like the C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video demo of the S40 interface running on the Nokia Asha 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is available as usual. It divides the screen into four sections, each of which is effectively a widget. The top row of the screen is reserved for status indicators (time, signal, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the clock is on top, followed by Social (Facebook, Twitter and Flickr integration) and two Shortcut bars at the bottom, each of which grants instant access to four favorite functions or apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two D pad button shortcuts available on the homescreen. A left or right click can be set to launch an app (both native and Java) or change the phone profile. By default, a left click opens the app collection and a right swipe opens the Java apps and games folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two soft keys on either side of the D pad that have corresponding functions in either UI menu. The soft keys are user-configurable - you can assign your shortcut of choice to each of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has only two views - Grid and List. The grid layout is handy for offering numpad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also rearrange the icons in the menu in whichever order you like, in both grid and list view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Go To shortcut is available and it gives you access to a list of nine shortcuts from the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard Nokia - you get a date and clock interface with the underlying wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest omission as usual is multitasking - we've given up hope that Nokia will add that a long time ago. This leads to bottlenecks though they are rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't leave it running in the background. You have to go through that every time you want to do something with the app, except check the latest notification (notifications do come in the background and only the last one is displayed).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Easy phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia Asha 200 will store about 2000 contacts depending on the fields you use, which isn't as good as unlimited storage but should do for those of us that aren't that popular. You can set the phonebook to display contacts from the phone memory, SIM memory or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple and straightforward - the phone asks for number, first and last name and that's it. When you need to add other details you can always go back and edit the contact. The phonebook can be set up to automatically store new contacts in a chosen location (phone, SIM) or to always ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separate from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. You can assign individual ringtones to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy shortcut in the Options menu for each contact brings up the SMS conversations you've had with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone book has search functionality too. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Two SIM cards in one Asha<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Aside from affordability and full QWERTY keyboard dual-SIM support is a main highlight of the Nokia Asha 200. It also features SIM hot-swapping for the second SIM card, which is located on the side of the phone, allowing users to quickly change SIM cards on the go, while keeping their main SIM card in the phone itself. Keep in mind that the external hot-swap SIM slot won't operate unless there's a SIM card in the master slot under the battery. So if you intend on operating the Asha 200 in a single SIM mode, you should use the internal slot only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make a call, you need to select which SIM the phone should use. You can set a default SIM, which will always be used for calls. Or you can have the phone prompt you to choose manually every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the SIM management menu, press and hold the * key. Selecting a default SIM for messages works the same way so you can have one SIM for calling and the other for texting. You can also toggle the standby mode - dual SIM, or the inner SIM only. Each SIM can have its own ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C2-03 can remember up to 5 SIMs - each SIM can have a name and an icon. This gives you easy at-a-glance info about which SIMs are currently inside the phone, no need to pop open the back and remove the battery just to check that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Asha 200 received a good mark. It's not the loudest handset around but won't cause many missed calls either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY-fied messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 comes with the standard (and quite capable) S40 messaging. It can handle all the common message types including SMS, MMS, as well as flash and audio messages and there's easy email setup, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical QWERTY keyboard is great added bonus for the heavy texter because it can run circles around regular 3-symbol-a-key keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Inbox view is available but you also get a Conversations view mode (that's the threaded message feature).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won't spend too much time finding your way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the left soft key reveals options where you'll find insert symbol and object. Symbols is an easy way to insert smileys or the symbols also available through the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message there's a character counter and message part counter available and when you're done you can pick the recipient from the contacts list, the recently used numbers, the call log or contact groups. You can have a favorite contact too (just one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inserting an image into a message automatically transforms it into a multimedia message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app lets you create multiple accounts on multiple networks with just your email address and password. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and you can put a Mail widget on the homescreen to keep track of new emails (the widget offers practically no info on the new emails though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing messages is greatly improved by the physical keyboard. Writing even long messages is pretty easy to do.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery sans the touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia Asha 200 offers only a single viewing mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. The landscape orientation of the screen helps when viewing images because there are no black bars around the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming into photos is a tiresome process as it takes long and isn't as comfortable as on touch-enabled S40 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a simple image editor on board, which can crop/rotate images, add text, clipart and effects, plus adjust brightness/contrast and color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline and, of course, you can start a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an album is very straightforward and the album view makes it easier for you to sort through your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also start a slide show, which gives you options like setting the interval between pics, the transition effect and offers a pleasurable experience for those that like to watch slideshows on their phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it's still here - but it's hidden in the Applications menu. It's a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files - both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is simple but gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Nokia Asha 200 has taken a step back compared to the one on the 300 - being more of an affordable and not multimedia-minded device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no great visuals and the now playing screen is as simple as it could get - just the name of the artist, album and song, a virtual rewind, forward, pause and a timeline scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there are some annoying limitations - for example, hitting the red receiver key turns off the music player and goes to the homescreen. The player can work in the background, but you have to go to Options &gt; Play in background for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, when not in the Now playing interface, there is no way to pause a song or skip to the next one, not even with the homescreen widget. You have to get into the music player to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Displaying the artist and title of the currently playing song are all that the homescreen widget does. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be enabled in the Homescreen mode settings for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several basic equalizer presets hidden deeper in the Music player menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player interface has carried over to the FM Radio one and covers the same basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio can also record broadcasts but that feature is regional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dodgy video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 managed to play DivX videos up to nHD resolution and those above were only audible - without actual video, only sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is simple and plain - users get a rewind, pause/play and forward buttons, going into options gives you fullscreen mode and others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent, if unspectacular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 did fairly well in our audio quality test. It's hard to recomend it to the most demanding audiphiles, but it should be good enough for just about everyone else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 200 got great scores for signal-to-noise levels, dynamic range and kept distortion levels well under control. The stereo crosstalk is higher than average and the frequency response is not exactly ideal, but its deviation is hardly detectable with a naked ear. Plus the Asha 200 is quite loud, so it really is a pretty good performer in this scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play you notice a moderate amount of degradation. Stereo crosstalk increases(though it's hardly major), distortion shoots up to just above average levels and frequency response worsens slightly. It's not too bad and the volume levels are still good, so as we said - everyone but the most pretentious users should find it fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2 MP worth of camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 has a 2MP fixed-focus snapper that produces photos with maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. The camera interface has been updated so it's a lot more like Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen you get a column on the bottom with the virtual shutter key in the center and the back and options keys besides it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A click on the D pad on the screen reveals more controls - indicators (photos remaining, resolution and white balance), digital zoom controls, and three shortcuts for video camera mode, gallery and self-timer. These auto-hide so they don't take up space on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into the Options menu, you get a menu popup. There are controls here for effects (greyscale, sepia, negative), white balance, a viewfinder grid and extended settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Asha 200 isn't all that good though we can't quite remember the last time we reviewed a phone with a 2MP camera. Colors look dull and our retail review unit had a lens issue - take a closer look at the smudgy spot a little on the left from the center of the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results themselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MMS-grade video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 is also capable of video capture but the QCIF (176 x 144) quality shouts bottom of the barrel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is the same as the camera. Options include setting the video length from MMS to maximum available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of quality the videos produced by the Asha 200 are awful. The lack of resolution aside detail is practically nonexistent and colors are all wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we guess the Asha 200 just isn't camera-oriented and Nokia have gone to some lengths to keep the price down - it's a bargain many users will gladly take.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity matches the pricing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 is a dual band device (900 / 1800) and offers GPRS and EDGE class 12. There's no 3G (HSDPA) or Wi-Fi on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is version 2.1 and A2DP is, of course, enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging. There's no USB-on-the-go here like on the Asha 300.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 200 also comes complete with a memory card slot. Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack, which allows you to use your own headphones, but doesn't have TV-out functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 browser is worse without touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser found on the Asha 200 is the Nokia Browser, which utilizes server-side compression to keep those data charges in check. Another plus of the compression method is faster page loading times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The start page is easy to navigate with a URL field and a search field at the top and shortcuts at the bottom for Social network, entertainment, news and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a data counter on board to keep a statistic of how much you've used out of your monthly data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages are rendered okay but some mobile sites turn out too zoomed in and users can only view a single article at a time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Store is the place to download free and paid apps and games for your Nokia Asha 200. The interface is easy to navigate but the lack of Wi-Fi means you'll be forced to use a data plan from your carrier to avoid huge bills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of preinstalled games on the Asha 200, the most noteworthy of which is Asphalt 3 Elite Racing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is really easy to use and Nokia have conveniently made a D pad and soft buttons layout to facilitate users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Present are also a voice recorder with no time limit and an alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notes app is self-explanatory, a to-do app is here too and you set different reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar application, like on every S40 Nokia phone out there, is pretty good. You can set reminders, meetings, calls, birthdays and more. The landscape layout offers a dual-screen viewing solution so you see the appointments you have without leaving the month view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though Nokia isn't one to leave the customer without all the required organizing apps you will be able to find some in the Nokia Store as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People who want their phone to be just a phone are in for a nice surprise with the Nokia Asha 200. It's two phones for the price of one. How's that for a bargain?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha series is a great place to get a bargain lately and Nokia must be happy with the performance of their entry-level phones. Despite recent woes forcing a painful review of their smartphone strategy, the Finns are like a well-oiled machine in the low end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Joining a growing team of dual SIM phones by Nokia, the Asha 200 doesn't seem to be at odds with any of the alternatives. Although most of its competition is coming from fellow Nokia devices, the Asha 200 is different enough to warrant its existence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If dual-SIM is a must, there isn't too many S40 phones to choose from. The C2-03 and C2-06 are touch phones and we're not sure people interested in the Asha 200 would be willing to consider them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C2-03 &#x2022; Nokia C2-06</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X2-02 is a brand new dual SIM handset, which upgrades the basic X1-01. It will perhaps be even cheaper than the Asha 200 and throws in an FM transmitter but will that make up for the lack of a QWERTY keyboard?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X2-02</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of QWERTY, the Asha 200 seems to hit middle ground between two older Nokia messengers, the C3-00 and the X2-01. The Nokia Asha 201 is well worth a look too if dual SIM is not required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C3 &#x2022; Nokia X2-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for real competition, Samsung come closest with a couple of dual SIM QWERTY messengers. The Ch@t 322 and Ch@t 222 are even more basic packages, featuring lower-res screens and inferior cameras. They both cost less or around the same as the Asha 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Ch@t 322 &#x2022; Samsung Ch@t 222</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 200 is not trying to impress but it ticks the boxes that count. It's not a novel concept, but the combination of a QWERTY keyboard and dual SIM support is a debut for Nokia, and one that can do well for them. Looks like the lowest bidder will get the job - and get it done.</paragraph>
