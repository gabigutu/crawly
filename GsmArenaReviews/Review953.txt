			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A year after the original took the tablet market by storm, the second generation ASUS Nexus 7 has arrived to take part in an altogether different ballgame. With the first generation of the compact slate having established the Nexus 7 brand as the most popular Android tablet available on the market, it is up to the newcomer to elevate it even further and sway potential users away from the Apple iPad Mini and Amazon's Kindle HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a first glance, the new ASUS Nexus 7 appears to be everything a tablet sequel is supposed to be. It is thinner, lighter, more powerful, and better put together. And naturally, in a fashion befitting the release of a new Nexus device, the compact tablet sequel comes with a new Android version out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the list of talents, which the second generation ASUS Nexus 7 has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the first Nexus 7 whose spec sheet sported some notable hardware compromises, the second generation of the slate appears to be a much more balanced product with no major omissions. The tablet ticks all the right boxes to find a spot in the Android tablets' top league - from the ultra-sharp display, through the capable chipset, all the way to the latest OS version, with timely updates guaranteed by Google itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also ramped up its attention towards the tablet realm recently, so the long-standing lack of quality apps for tablets may finaly be taken care of in the year ahead. This would certainly help the cause of the 2013 ASUS Nexus 7 in expanding its reach beyond the current Android users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, considering the success of the first Nexus 7, our expectations towards its sequel run quite high. As always, we'll kick the review festivities off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like its predecessor, the 2013 ASUS Nexus 7 comes in a small retail box. Inside it, you will find nothing but a charger, a USB cable and a couple of leaflets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 is now a popular name in the tablet realm, so there are plenty of aftermarket accessories available for the slate. They range from cases, stands, sleeves and everything in between, so you are more than covered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nexus-branded devices have always possessed somewhat understated aesthetics and the new ASUS Nexus 7 is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only design "flare" located on the tablet is the large Nexus sign, which is placed in landscape fashion. It contrasts with the matte back of the tablet, thus adding a small but attractive bit of character to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is phenomenal. The 2013 ASUS Nexus 7 has got a simple but effective construction and is built to take some use and abuse. The back of the slate is made of sturdy, soft-feel polycarbonate, while its front is entirely covered by a single piece of Corning's Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall feel of the new Nexus 7 is really reassuring. The slate almost feels like a unibody - not an item which has been put together from separate parts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation ASUS Nexus 7 has slimmed down significantly in comparison to its predecessor. The newcomer's measures are 200 x 114 x 8.7 mm, while its weight tips the scale at the highly reasonable 290 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Save for the length increase by a millimeter, each of the 2013 Nexus 7's measures represent a drastic improvement over last year's model. The slate is as slim as 7-inchers come these days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the display on the last year's model, the 2013 ASUS Nexus 7 has a high-quality 7" IPS screen with awe-inspiring pixel density. To put it simply, this one looks gorgeous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display's resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is the highest available on a compact tablet at the moment. The resulting pixel density of 323ppi eclipses the Retina display equipped Apple iPad's 264ppi, and completely wipes the floor with the 162ppi of the 7.9" iPad Mini or even the 216ppi of the Amazon Kindle Fire HD. Google's own Nexus 10 is the only tablet that's close to what the Nexus 7 offers, with a pixel density of 299ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, being a high-quality IPS unit, the display of the 2013 Nexus 7 sports great color reproduction, coupled with impressive contrast and ridiculously wide viewing angles. Combined, all these qualities make gobbling up multimedia content, web browsing, even the simple task of writing an email on the slate a pleasurable experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you will find the 1.2MP front-facing camera, as well as the ambient light. The tablet's notification light is located below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing on the left side of the Nexus 7. The volume rocker, the power/lock key, as well as a small pinhole for the built-in microphone are located on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack sits lonely at the top. The USB port shares the same fate on the bottom of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the ASUS Nexus 7 is home of two major additions to the 2013 model. There is now a 5MP camera there, and also, there is now a pair of stereo speakers - located at both sides, when you hold the tablet in landscape orientation. The large Nexus insignia completes the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great build and the compact measures make handling the new ASUS Nexus 7 a pleasure. Our only complaint is about the awkward positioning of the stereo speakers. When you hold up the tablet in landscape orientation, they end up under your hands, so the sound gets muffled a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other major disadvantage is the lack of a microSD slot to expand the available storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Nexus 7 packs a non-removable/non-replaceable 3950mAh battery. It is smaller than the battery, which powered the previous generation of the tablet, but, to make up for it, it has to power up more energy-efficient internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took the slate through our web browser and video playback battery tests. You can see how it fared below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the stock video player being quite limited (it wouldn?t open an MP4 file transferred over the USB port, we conducted the video playback test using MX Player Pro from the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the freshly updated OS of the new generation Nexus 7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2013 Asus Nexus 7 2 was announced alongside a new Android version. This time around, Google added another tenth to the Android release number and brought 4.3 Jelly Bean to the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a quick look at the new OS in action in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While at a first glance, the newly launched OS version appears to be a minor release, it comes with plenty of tweaks under the hood, thud optimizing an already well accomplished OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most notable changes in Android 4.3 include improved multi-user support with the introduction of restricted profiles (read Kid's Mode, of sorts), updated stock apps, and improved notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, there's support for OpenGL ES 3.0 for even better graphic and gaming experience, support for Bluetooth 4.0 with low energy (LE) mode, and new hardware-based encryption for DRM for easier streaming of copyrighted high-definition content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the lockscreen area of the new Nexus 7 offers a great deal of functionality. There are multiple unlock routines, some more secure, some quicker to unlock, but the default is swipe to unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock on the lockscreen is now a widget rather than a fixed item. You can have multiple widgets (you swipe left and right to go between them) and you can rearrange them similar to homescreen widgets. The difference is that only one widget can be visible at a time. The widgets that are available by default are a digital clock, Gmail and Calendar (you can have multiple copies of each). Apps can add their own lockscreen widgets to the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have more than one user set for the tablet, you'll see their images as circles at the bottom of the screen. This is a great way to share a tablet at home as everyone will get to use the slate as they like - as long as you don't use it at the same time, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap a circle to switch to that user, which will also change everything from settings through what installed apps are installed to what files are accessible. So, if you snap a photo while signed into your account, it will only be accessible from that account. That works even when you hook up the tablet to a computer - you can't access files from another account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you try to install an app that's already installed on the tablet, but on another account, the OS will make it available for your account too (without re-downloading it). The apps files will be separate for the different accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the multi-user support is a great way of sharing your Nexus 7 with your partner/kids or even roommates. It doesn't waste any storage and there's no need to fear that your settings will be messed up or your apps/saved files deleted. Nor is there the need to deal with other people's apps that you don't need either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The addition of restricted profiles to Android 4.3 allows the tablet's primary owner to choose which applications a restricted user can access. Naturally, before setting up a restricted user on the slate, the primary one will need to set up a secure lockscreen feature for his/her own profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still the usual five homescreen panes, none to be added or removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A portion along the bottom of the display has been reserved for three on-screen buttons - Back, Home and Recent apps. The buttons are easy to reach on the tablet's relatively compact display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the row is the tray where the most commonly used apps can be docked. The Nexus 7 allows up to six shortcuts to be placed within it, surrounding the app drawer shortcut in the middle. Any of the six shortcuts can be customized by dragging icons into and out of the tray, and you can even create folders by dragging icons on top of one another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another permanent fixture is the Google Search bar at the top of the screen, which stays in place as you scroll the homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is split into two, much like the split-screen keyboard in iOS, so you actually get two separate pull-downs. The first handles all the system notifications -emails, instant messages, app notifications, etc. The second pull-down tray holds various settings shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one in the top left shows the current user and lets you switch to another one. Other settings include Wi-Fi, auto-rotate, battery info, airplane mode and Bluetooth. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth will bring you to the full settings instead of just toggling them on and off as is more common with notification area toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer holds no surprises compared to previous Android versions. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets - that feature side-scrollable pages. If you don't like swiping, you can tap on the margin on the left and right of the grid of shortcuts to quickly move between screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you scroll past the available apps you automatically move into the Widgets tab. There's also a shortcut next to the tabs, for quick access to the Android app market. A slight annoyance is that apps and widgets are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option or a way to manually rearrange them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a shortcut or widget works as you would expect - you press and hold to grab it and then position it anywhere on the homescreen. While you're dragging, an Uninstall field will appear along the top of the screen, where you can drop to remove widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being resizable both vertically and horizontally (some can be resized only in one direction), homescreen widgets in Jelly Bean automatically adjust their size to fit in the spot where you want to place them. This is especially useful on an already busy homescreen. Also, if you drag one widget on top of the other, it will make space for itself by forcing the icons underneath to rearrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To resize a widget, you tap and hold and then release it. Four handles will appear on its sides, allowing you to change the widget's size in the direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are created in much the same way as in the shortcut dock; you simply drag one shortcut on top of another. By default, a new folder won't have a label, but you can name it by opening it and tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to display the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folder icons are circular with the shortcuts inside lined one behind the other as if looked at an angle (complete with perspective). They are lined up in order, so the first shortcut in the folder will be the only one clearly visible, with the rest falling behind progressively smaller and obscured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recent apps button brings up a list of your recently-used applications. It displays thumbnails of the applications which you can press to open quickly, or swipe to the side to remove.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.3 Jelly Bean isn't just business and no play. Google has integrated a little feature called Daydream, which is simply a sort of a screensaver. Once turned on, you can set it up to show photo albums or the latest news from Google Currents when the device is either docked or idle.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, has the weather forecast for your location and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you allow it, can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and contacts') and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easily turned off from the Google Now settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an Internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making dictation available offline also made it faster. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2013 Asus Nexus 7 is powered by Qualcomm APQ8064 Snapdragon S4 Pro SoC, which packs a 1.5 GHz quad-core Krait CPU and Adreno 320GPU. There's 2GB of RAM on board to keep things running smoothly at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate's chipset recorded a respectable outing in the synthetic benchmark field. Despite not being the latest and greatest available on the market today, it often rubbed shoulders with the established top dogs in the smartphone field- both in terms of CPU and GPU performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as tablets go, most of the time, the new Nexus 7 handily posted better benchmarks scores than its competitors in and around its price range. See for yourself below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Benchmarks aside, there wasn't a task, which the 2013 Asus Nexus 7 couldn't handle with ease. We did for example, spend quite a few hours playing Real Racing 3 (ah, the joys of being a reviewer!) - one of the most graphic intensive games available out there. The tablet performed buttery smooth, without even a hint of lag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The People app is at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the Wi-Fi version of the Nexus 7 can't connect to a cell network for either voice or data, it still features the familiar Android 'People' app which displays the contacts from your Google account. If you have other communication applications such as Skype installed, it will display the contacts from them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the menu on the left, you can switch between All contacts, Groups, and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is split into two - the list of contacts on the left and individual contact details on the right. In case the contact has a Google Plus account, their updates will be posted in a third column on the right (it's visible only in landscape mode, but not in portrait).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search feature, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, a click on any of the contact details will open up the relevant application - an email address opens up the email or Gmail app, a Google+ IM opens up the contact in the installed Google+ messenger, and even pressing on a phone number can open up a relevant application for dialing phone numbers over the web, such as Skype (if you have it installed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while Favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email and instant messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app enjoyed yet another major overhaul recently. A new email sorting format was introduced, which separates your incoming messages into three different inboxes. The most important one is dubbed Primary. The other two are called Social and Promotion - they handle your SNS messages, as well as the promo emails you receive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the new Gmail functionality to work like a charm. Sorting through multiple text messages is now easier than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instant messaging duties have been taken over by Google Hangouts, which replaced Google Talk in Android 4.3. The new messenger features a polished UI, and handles instant messages, as well as video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be sent and received as well. With the updated stock IM app, Google is trying to offer a viable alternative to the popular services out there such as WhatsApp and Viber.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android 4.3 Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 tablet comes with a standard looking Android keyboard. Typing on the tablet's display is an easy task in both portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very good at guessing what it is you're trying to type and a feature can be enabled that keeps a floating label above your finger with the current guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you can go further and "type" hands-free too - Google has baked the voice recognition algorithms needed to run it into Android itself. Not only does this make Voice typing faster, but also eliminates the need for an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, you can download up to 15 localized language packs for offline voice typing, although we imagine that Google is working on adding more. The language packs are quite small in size (the default English (US) pack comes in at just 22 MB), so you don't need to worry about them using up your precious storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean, the Android keyboard's nuts and bolts got updated as well. It now features smarter dictionary and learning algorithms, so the more you type, the better it can predict what you're trying to say. It resembles Swiftkey's smart dictionary system, but only time will tell if it performs as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Default view of the gallery is Albums, a list of all folders with photos in a rectangular grid. The other views are Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (photos with tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the Make Available Offline feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing single images has been tweaked somewhat. You still get the convenient share button along with a menu with several options - Crop and rotate tools, a more feature-rich Editor (we'll get back to it in a minute) and a slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe left and right to move between images in an album and you can also pinch to zoom out to display a strip of three images at a time. This is an easy way to quickly browse photos but also delete some - you just swipe them up or down. When you discard an image, an undo button appears allowing you to restore it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small icon at the bottom left launches the Editor (or you can do it from the menu). The editor offers filters, frames, crop/rotate/straighten tools along with color correction effects ranging from auto color to manual curves control. Most of these options have a slider that lets you apply the effect with the desired intensity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sub-par video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Videos by default are once again accessed via the Gallery app. There is not a dedicated video player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's absolutely no way to sugarcoat this - the stock video player in Android has remained well below average in the latest 4.3 version of the OS. It played only MP4 format files, which were captured by the tablet's camera. Curiously, when we uploaded an MP4 movie via the USB cable, the player refused to play it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, with the Google Play Store readily available, there are plenty of capable movie players to choose from. We managed the play the abovementioned MP4 file without any hickups, using a third party player from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google would also happily take your money for giving you access to its own rich library of available video content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is the default player for your tunes - both online and on your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dropdown menu is used to organize your music library - there's Recent (the default view), Albums, Artists, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is working, a playback control widget that features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls is added to the list of widgets on the lockscreen, pushing back the ones already there. There are playback controls in the notification area too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output good, but not the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 7 (2013) delivers perfectly clean audio output when connected to an active external amplifier. Its volume levels are lower than we would have expected from a tablet, but it's not too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the output quality takes a slight knock - the stereo crosstalk goes up notably and some intermodulation distortion creeps in. Volume levels drop significantly, too, so overall the performance is somewhat unspectacular for the tablet league. It's not too bad, mind you, and had it been a smartphone we would have been perfectly happy with it - it's just that most tablets tend to do even better here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera is surprisingly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2013 Google Nexus 7 packs a 5 megapixel camera, producing still shots with a resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. There's no LED flash, so don't count on it doing wonders in low-light situations. The front-facing camera does 1.2MP stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has been given a fresh coat of paint. With a simple tap and hold, a circle pops out giving you access to the various options. Once your finger touches a particular setting icon, it expands to reveal its options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is very similar to Quick controls in the browser (except that it works everywhere, not just the corners) and is quite handy on the big screen (instead of having to reach for a particular icon). Alternatively, you can invoke the settings circle by pressing the icon in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side there is a big blue button used for capturing. Beneath it is the camera/camcorder switch icon. From there you can choose to shoot panoramas and photo spheres, which we'll cover in depth in just a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available, too, and works reasonably fast - just make sure you don't hold your finger for too long as the settings circle will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features are not as rich as you might expect from a smartphone - there's no HDR mode or ISO settings, for example, though you can still adjust white balance and exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 4.0, Google introduced the Panorama capturing mode, and now with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean users will get a cool feature dubbed Photo Sphere. It's a panorama mode on steroids and allows you to capture photos in multiple directions (up, down, left, right). Think Street View and you'll get the idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is friendly and intuitive. It shows you dots which you have to aim the camera at, then rinse and repeat until you get a 360-degree Photo Sphere photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After they've been captured and saved as JPEG files, you can view them and navigate around the whole image. You can share the image on Google+ or, if you feel like it, contribute the Photo Sphere to Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface lacks a shortcut to the Gallery app - it was replaced by a swipe to the right opens the Camera app's Filmstrip view. It gives you the ability to quickly discard any photos you've taken by swiping them up or down or just quickly glance at recent shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Nexus 7 primary camera is actually not bad at all. Besides the relatively high levels of noise, the images look spot on in terms of colors, contrast and even sharpness.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080P video capture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface of the Nexus 10 is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same panel on the right and quick settings when you hold your finger over the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice option is the switch to 720p video recording, should you decide you don't need the larger files that come with the increased resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video shot with the Nexus 7 camera has plenty of detail and smooth framerate, however the continuous auto focus is bit overeager, constantly hunting for focus in our sample setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video has a bitrate of 12Mbps and the video sound is recorded as mono.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer you can also download this untouched 1080p sample coming straight from the Nexus 7.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tons of local connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 tablet comes in two versions - 16GB/32GB. The version with LTE data connectivity will ship only with 32GB on board. For local connectivity, you get dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n along with Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 supports NFC along with the latest version of Android Beam. This enables simple transfer of images between two NFC-enabled phones and you can pair a Bluetooth speaker with a simple tap (if it supports NFC, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless charging is also supported out of the box. It uses the popular Qi standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet also comes with a built-in A-GPS receiver. User reports have emerged that the tablet would regularly lose GPS signal, though we are yet to experience such an event. Google however, is reportedly investigating the matter so if it's more than an isolated problem, a fix should be around the corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port handles both charging and computer connections. You should note that there's no mass storage mode available, you'll have to use MTP instead. It works just as well for transferring most files but some files are a problem (e.g. a ZIP file we needed to offload from the device didn't show up in the explorer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 supports USB OTG out of the box unlike the previous generation Nexus 7. A standard adapter needed for the feature to work can be purchased separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome keeps evolving<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tablet version of Google Chrome has tabs on the top - it all looks a lot like the desktop Chrome browser, complete with the new tab button. You can also use sideway swipes to switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open a new tab, you're greeted with a list of the most visited sites. You can also access your bookmarks from here or even tabs you have open on any other device you have Chrome running on (your computer, your phone, even other tablets). Incognito tabs are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar has a couple of handy shortcuts - one allows you to perform a voice search, which is quicker than typing, and the other is the star, which allows you to add a site to your bookmarks (this one should be familiar from desktop Chrome).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing or request the desktop version of a site. You can also allow the browser to preload links from search results it's certain you're going to open, but you can also opt for enabling this over Wi-Fi only to preserve your data allowance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is, of course, not supported but as the web moves towards HTML5, Flash becomes less and less relevant. Still, if it's that important to you, you should know that we manage to side-load the Flash Player and enable it on some of the alternative browsers available at the Play Store. So if Flash is a must, you can have it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Cloud-focused office editor out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default office editor on the new Nexus 7 is Google Drive. It handles popular document formats with ease and it is free. Data connection is required to sync documents, though offline editing can also be enabled. Once you go back online, Google Drive will update your progress accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can always find a third-party office editor in the Google Play Store. There are plenty of capable ones available, but they are not free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock calendar on the Nexus 7 has four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The Calendar makes good use of the bigger screen - daily and weekly views for example dedicate the top part of the screen to the day/week, while the bottom is taken up by a small monthly calendar, so you can quickly jump between dates. Similarly, the Agenda view uses a split-screen interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to desk clock mode that might be of some use if you have a dock for your Nexus 10, other than that it's just a drain of battery power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ringtone and label. A timer and stopwatch functions are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator holds no surprises. It has both basic and more advanced functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Plus app is preinstalled on the Nexus 7. Google is committed to growing its own social network, and the app keeps improving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Currents is a beautiful news aggregator, similar to Flipboard. It follows the Holo UI design with flat graphics and sideway swipes. The Currents library starts off with several magazines but you can check out the trending news or quickly add more magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will re-route you if you go off-course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache New York and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store now has a tablet section<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Play Store has several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. It hooks into your Google Plus info and will recommend apps based on what your friends like, but also based on what other people like, even if they're not in your circles, but have installed the same apps as you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a dedicated section for optimized slate apps called Tablet 101.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When downloading an application, you get useful info on the app, like rating and comments along with the info, screenshots and demo videos by the developers. Before confirming the download, the Market will show you a list of permissions required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Play Store features much more than apps - you can also buy (or rent) movies, TV shows, magazines, books, as well as textbooks. You can even charge those to your phone bill rather than your credit card (it works only on some operators, in some countries).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After taking the new ASUS Nexus 7 through the hoops of our review process, we are happy to tell you that the slate is almost everything we hoped it will be. As a successor to the most popular tablet in the Android kingdom, the 2013 Nexus 7 ticks just about every box in the requirements' lists of upgraders and new users alike - it is compact, good-looking, well-built, and powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were mostly taken by the new display. It is so good that we were left puzzled why ASUS and Google didn't cook up a marketing lingo of some sort to promote its quality. It is a perfect companion for the new, now tablet friendly Google Play Store and the loads of content available on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset, though not the latest and greatest available at the moment, handled every task we threw at it with ease, while keeping it easy on the battery. Considering the price point of the tablet, we could hardly ask for more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless charging is also a nice perk and the Nexus 7 2013 is the only tablet to offer it right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as negatives go, we really wish that the newly added stereo speakers were facing forward instead of sideward - the sonic experience would have been significantly better. Our biggest regret is that there is no microSD slot to expand the available storage - this would have made the tablet an even better deal, but Google has priced the 32GB only $40 higher so it's anything but a rip off (in stark contrast to the situation with Apple's iPads).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is far from great too, though we must point out that our experience showed us that it is best suited for enhancing the video calling experience - mobile photography really comes second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year's lack of quality apps, which lead to Android delivering far from perfect tablet experience, has been somewhat addressed by Google. Everyone, but the biggest Apple iPad junkie is likely to find all the essential downloadable tablet software in the Google Play Store these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the ASUS Nexus 7 starts at $229 for a 16GB Wi-Fi version. A slate with 32GB of memory on board will cost another $40, while the LTE equipped versions will cost a still reasonable $349 for a device with 32GB of memory on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such aggressive pricing leaves the new ASUS Nexus 7 with practically no competition, considering the hardware on offer. If you insist on shopping around, here are some other options for relatively the same amount of cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's recently launched Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and 8.0 are priced at $199.99 and $299.99 respectively - right in the ballpark of the new Nexus 7. The Korean offerings pack less capable hardware - they try to make up for it by having TouchWiz-ed Android on board. The latter offers better multimedia support out of the box, but not much else, so they are not exactly the best deal out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 P3210 ? Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS MeMO Pad HD7 priced at $149 is significantly cheaper than the Nexus 7. The presence of expandable memory aside, its hardware is seriously inferior to the one offered by its Nexus-branded sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Memo Pad HD7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini, with a starting price of $329, is the option for those who are obsessed about having access to the richest catalog of tablet apps. Keep in mind however, that the gap is narrowing quickly in this area. As far as hardware goes, the Nexus 7, again, offers more than the Apple entry in the segment. The price premium for the 32GB version of the iPad mini also makes the Nexus 7 a much better deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the alternatives to the 2013 ASUS Nexus 7 requires a level of compromise (and in some cases more cash) in order to rank as a proper alternative. Google's offering is really that good. Of course, we're yet to see Amazon's next generation of Kindles. These are expected in Fall 2013 and perhaps they can turn the scales in Amazon's favor. But until then, the Nexus 7 will be the sole ruler of the compact Android tablet world - or at least, a ruler in a certain part of the Android world, because unfortunately, this highly competitive tablet is not as widely available as we would have liked. Some key European countries are going to get it in the end of August and we are yet to see where it will go from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stepping back for a moment, it amazing how Google and ASUS began their joint-forces assault on compact tablet market only last year and they are already among the leaders. This time around, the latest creation to come of this partnership is leaner, meaner, and simply better than its competitors. Bar any unforeseen market shifts or severe inventory shortages, the new ASUS Nexus 7 is all but certain to deservedly be a massive success during its product cycle.</paragraph>
