			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major releases for the first half of 2016 are out, time to see what's worth spending your hard earned cash on. For all the flagship goodness we saw at the MWC (and other events), there's an equal measure of amazing entry-level and midrange handsets out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we don't use "amazing" lightly here, the ?200-?300 phones offer metal unibodies, capable cameras, fast chipsets, large batteries, the works. You can even get a metal-clad phone at just over ?100 - some smart shopping can get you a quality gadget even if you're on a shoestring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the point of this article, to set you on the right track, point to what's good out there and warn against some potential bad choices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These days there are only two things where you really have to spend more to get more - screen and camera. The ?600+ flagships have eye-popping screens with perfect color rendering, excellent sunlight legibility and goodies like Always On mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They also have cameras that handle different types of photography well enough that you can leave your digital camera at home and focus on the moment instead of settings and dials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else is suffering from diminishing returns - sure, the flagships get the latest chipsets, but the perceived difference in speed may not always be obvious. Game developers have to develop for the masses, so a game would rarely need Chipset 9000+ to work. Battery life is often better at the low-end than the high-end, good audio quality only matters with headphones that cost more than some of the phones on this list and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each phone we list the most important specs in a table to make comparisons easier. If you need to dive into more detail, we have reviews of many of these phones. We pulled out relevant complaints from these reviews so you'll know the downsides of each phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build-up is driven by price - we start at sub-?100 phones and go all the way to the premium stuff. You can read end-to-end or jump straight to the page that matches your budget. If you do that though, don't forget to check the previous chapter and the one after. It can either save you a few bucks or help you spot a phone that delivers something you want at an acceptable price premium.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under ?100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've split this chapter in two: the bare essentials and phones just under ?100. Some regional brands have dirt cheap phones, but we take a more global look. The locals will still get a mention at the end of the chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bare essentials group is a bunch of different OSes. They are great for people that mostly need a phone, but with some smartphone perks - whether its IM chat like WhatsApp or just good Maps, feature phones rarely offer those (and if they do, you'll probably get a clunky app that is never updated).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Joy is a small phone (4" screen) from early 2015 that runs Android 4.4 KitKat. It's low on processing power and storage too - the one we found has only 512MB of RAM and 4GB storage, but some versions have double that. Still, with GPS, microSD slot and a decent 5MP camera it will get you where you need to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android has always struggled a bit in the sub-?100 field, but Samsung's Tizen found itself a niche there. The Tizen Z1 is the baby of the lineup, with specs mostly identical to the Joy, but it recently received the latest OS update - the benefit of first-party software. Also, for this price you get a dual-SIM phone (but no LTE).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the Microsoft Lumia 530, which has essentially the same specs, but has become less attractive as of late. First, its 4GB of storage will probably prevent it from getting updated to Windows 10 (there's no clear confirmation either way). Second, HERE Maps was sold off and while Microsoft is developing a replacement, it's not clear how functional the WP8.1 version will be - in a blog post, the HERE team said that its apps will be removed the Windows 10 store, while the WP8 will only get bugfixes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to the more serious players, which incidentally represent the same three OSes and fall in the "90 and a bit" euro price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Spirit is really worth the upgrade over the Joy, so unless you're sure you want the cheapest phone, we'd recommend saving up for a bit longer and going with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts with the screen - 4.7" 720p is about the size and sharpness as an iPhone 6 (though with worse colors and contrast). The camera is solid too - 8MP stills and 1080p videos. Not iPhone 6 quality, of course, but solid. The processing power is on par too with a quad-core processor. Note that we found the H420 version with Cortex-A7 but there's one with Cortex-A53. That's the LTE-enabled H440 version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's answer is the Lumia 550. The phone launched with Windows 10 (avoiding the 530's issues) and comes with a 4.7" 720p screen like the Spirit. The camera isn't as good though - you only get 5MP/720p. The entry-level chipset means even Windows feels sluggish, another knock against the Lumia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the Joy/Spirit, the Lumia 550 is strongly preferred over the 530.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tizen candidate is much improved too. You get a 5" 720p screen and it's a Super AMOLED - even though it's an older generation, it's the best screen in its price segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tizen's weakness is apps (same goes for Windows), Samsung's solution is to add Android app support. On all the platforms we've seen, added Android compatibility is less than perfect, but it's an excellent compromise for rare apps - the apps not in the Windows Store are out of Lumia's reach and that's that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sub-?100 phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Yu Yuphoria launched to much fanfare, but unfortunately its availability is limited to India. The Lenovo A6000 is a solid phone too, but can be equally hard to find. Both boast 5" 720p screens, quad-core processor and 8MP cameras. Solid if your local shop has them, but not good enough to warrant importing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG K4 was released a month ago, but we dropped it in favor of the older Spirit. Its screen has sub-HD resolution, you don't get 1080p video (lower resolution stills too, 5MP) and no Android Marshmallow. At roughly the same price, we'd have the Spirit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the 550, the Microsoft Lumia 535 has a bigger screen (5" vs. 4.7") and a 5MP selfie cam (vs. 2MP). However, we picked the newer model for its better screen (brighter, better sunlight).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter, we'll split phones into two groups again, but this time based on screen size instead of price. We have a solid group of 5" phones as well as several 5.5" ones. Depending on who you ask, it's either 5" or 5.5" that's the minimum screen size nowadays, so we take the neutral approach and offer options for both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablets offer more than just a bigger screen - in this price range they typically have better specs too (e.g. 1080p screen resolution, better chipset and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the yardstick - the Motorola Moto G Turbo Edition. An improved Moto G (3rd gen), the Turbo is the go-to answer to the question "what phone should I get, but not too big?"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's because it has it all - fresh Android 6.0 Marshmallow, IP67 water resistance (up to 1m of water for 30 minutes), solid performance with a 64-bit octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM, good camera, taking 13MP photos and recording 1080p videos, 5MP selfies too, dual-SIM and LTE connectivity... Really, the only issue we see with the Moto G Turbo Edition is that it may not be available in your region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J5 (the original 2015 edition) has a 5" Super AMOLED screen (720p resolution again). Samsung has perfected the AMOLED and while this one isn't the top model, we found its colors very natural and accurate, on top of great sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a 13MP camera with 1080p videos and it has a bright f/1.9 aperture, similar (but not equal) to the Galaxy S6. It only has a quad-core processor with 1.5GB of RAM and it's running Android 5.1 Lollipop. The screen and camera do sound attractive, but the Galaxy J5 doesn't quite live up to the Motorola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 brings upscale features while costing the least of the three. It too has a 5" 720p screen, but this time it is wrapped in a metal chassis with a diamond pattern. And get this - it has a 4,100mAh battery, while being almost as thin as the J5 (and much thinner than the G Turbo). And you get fast charging support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi continues to trump its Samsung adversary with an octa-core processor (a slightly upgraded version of the chipset used in the Motorola). It comes with 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage and is a dual-SIM phone with a hybrid slot. It runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with customizations across the board, courtesy of Xiaomi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department of the Redmi 3 is built around a 13MP camera with phase detection autofocus and f/2.0 lens, with 1080p video capture, of course. For selfies there's the usual 5MP/1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite has a sleek design (7.7mm thin, about the same as the J5). It has everything you'd expect at this stage: a 5" 720p screen, an octa-core processor, dual-SIM and microSD slot, 13MP camera (f/2.0, 1080p) and a 5MP selfie shooter. The battery is small - 2,200mAh - but you get a passable 53h between charges out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of cheaper alternatives (we're talking some ?40-?50 down here) include the Microsoft Lumia 640, specifically the 3G dual-SIM variant (but you can get LTE for some extra cash). You get to enjoy a first-party OS experience, including an upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile (and the limited app selection that comes with Microsoft's platform).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" 720p screen has ClearBlack tech, which reduces glare in bright sunlight, and Gorilla Glass 3. The camera is an 8MP shooter with 1080p video capture and you get a lowly 1MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Huawei Honor Holly 2 Plus. Its limited regional availability can make getting one a tall task, but if you can get it, you'll enjoy a 5" IPS screen of 720p resolution, a 13MP f/2.0 camera and 5MP selfie camera and a generous 4,000mAh battery. The chipset is nothing special (similar to the Galaxy J5) and you'll be running Android 5.1 Lollipop with Huawei's EMUI 3.1, but you'll save some cash doing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to expand to 5.5" and we won't spend much money for the upgrade. In fact, last year's Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 costs as much as the smaller (but newer) Redmi 3. It offers a 5.5" 1080p screen and a faster chipset to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is pretty similar - 13MP f/2.2 with phase detection and 1080p video plus a 5MP selfie cam (video limited to 720p). This older model has a "small" battery, though, only 3,060mAh (but it's removable, for what it's worth).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi's rivals over at Meizu have the m1 metal to offer. Despite the name, the phone is actually closer to the m2 note, but at least the phone is made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a similar 5.5" 1080p screen (but with a scratch-resistant glass), the same chipset and similarly-customized Android (5.1, but still) and a similar 13MP f/2.2 camera with 1080p video and 5MP selfies (this time around with 1080p video support). The battery is barely any bigger (and it's sealed), but you do get a better battery life out of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200 phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the smaller 5" phones, the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua nearly made the cut. Its IP68 certification used to be impressive in this price range, plus you get a solid 5" 720p screen, an octa-core processor, 13MP/1080p camera and Xperia's traditionally solid battery life (81h Endurance on a 2,400mAh battery!). Sony is good with the upgrades too and a Marshmallow update has been promised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Moto G Turbo is already at Marshmallow and it offers much of the same features at a lower cost. Still, Sony fans will find a solid performer in the M4 Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe K5 Note is a solid alternative to the Meizu m1 metal. It too has a metal body, but with a fingerprint reader on the back, something no other phone on the list so far has offered. You get a similar (slightly faster) chipset, similar camera (but with 8MP selfies), bigger battery too. Our only worry is that it can be hard to find in stores in most countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For Windows devices, there's the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL with a 5.7" screen, but unfortunately it only has 720p resolution. A 13MP camera with f/2.0 Carl Zeiss optics might make you feel better, plus the selfie cam is workable (unlike the smaller 640) - 5MP/1080p. It's the screen that killed it for us, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this price bracket, we found some awesome 5.5-inchers. Although the choice of high-end 5-inchers was limited, we managed to find some worthwhile upgrades over the ?100-?200 range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick off with a pair of rivals from Meizu and Xiaomi. The Meizu MX5 sounds like a dream - metal body, 5.5" AMOLED screen, 20.7MP camera with a large 1/2.3" sensor and 2160p video capture, a fingerprint reader, the works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does have some flaws though. The immediately obvious one is the lack of a microSD slot and while there is a 64GB version, it can be hard to find (leaving you with just 16GB and 32GB). You could switch to 1080p videos to save on storage, but they have noticeably worse quality than the 2160p videos (which are great). The battery life isn't spectacular either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Meizu MX5 is an outgoing flagship (the MX6 should arrive soon), the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 landed half a year later as a super midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It too has a metal body and a 5.5" screen (IPS), plus a fingerprint sensor. There are two versions - one with a Snapdragon 650 chipset and another one with MediaTek Helio X10. While both appear similar, they are actually quite different - the Snapdragon one has a microSD slot (where SIM2 goes) and the chipset itself is generally faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Meizu, the Redmi Note 3 camera isn't as impressive - 13MP and 1080p - but the 4,000mAh battery will go a longer distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola launched the Moto X Play to compete in the 5.5" 1080p segment. The phone impresses with a 21MP camera with a big 1/2.4" sensor and water repellent nano coating (IP52), plus a clean Android 6.0 Marshmallow and solid battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is a bit of a letdown though - the Snapdragon 615 is not very competitive in the GPU department (the octa-core CPU has a low clock speed too) and it can't record 2160p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, at these price latitudes you either get an older flagship or a new midranger, but often the former king still has an edge over the whippersnappers. So, here are a couple of old-but-gold handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 boasts a 5.7" Super AMOLED screen (1080p) with the S Pen stylus, which is pressure sensitive for a more natural writing experience. The camera may be an older 13MP shooter, but it does 2160p and 1080p @ 60fps. Plus, this was from the power-user days when you got a microSD slot and a removable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is old, a Snapdragon 800, which compares well to the new 600s, especially in GPU tests. The software is a bigger worry though - it's on Android 5.0 Lollipop and will probably stay there (there's always the custom ROM path, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 was the phone positioned against the Note 3. It has a 5.5" screen of QHD resolution (back in 2014 it was mightily impressive) and its 13MP/2160p camera has optical image stabilization. The G3 is a compact phone too, barely bigger than some 5" phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen contrast and sunlight legibility left something to be desired, but battery life was okay, the video camera does very well and you get a slightly newer chipset (Snapdragon 801) and an Android 6.0 Marshmallow upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We come back down the size scale to the 5.2" LG Nexus 5X. A refreshed version of a well-loved phone, the 5X adds a fingerprint reader for that sweet Android Pay integration and improves the poor battery life of the 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is something special too - a 12.3MP resolution on a large 1/2.3" sensor makes for amazing low-light performance for stills and 2160p videos. You do lose the OIS from the older model (but gain Laser AF), the wireless charging is gone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 was when Samsung tried to make water resistance (IP67) and microUSB 3.0 standard features. While the port switch fizzled out, water resistance is back big time with the S7 generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a very capable 16MP camera (the first to offer phase-detection AF on a phone) with 2160p video. Despite the waterproofing, you can still access the battery and you get a microSD slot. Right on time for this guide, Samsung started releasing the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update, making this phone even more appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony released the Xperia Z3+ as a supposed upgrade over the Z3, but the more we looked at it, the more it felt like a downgrade. Sure, the jump to Snapdragon 810 is an important upgrade over the S801 in the Xperia Z3, but not that important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's what you lose - battery life (85h Endurance for the Z3, 64h for the Z3+), the stereo speakers don't sound as good, the plus version is pricier, the screen on the Z3+ is ever so slightly worse... There's a reason why Sony, the smartphone maker, is struggling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z3 is a beautiful device though, a metal frame sandwiched between two panes of toughened glass, an IP68 water resistance rating, stereo speakers, great battery life, a 20.7MP camera with a large 1/2.3" sensor, 2160p video capture, there's a lot to love.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And at the very top of the ?200-?300 range is a fan-favorite mini-edition, the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. The 4.6" 720p screen is wrapped in a water-resistant body (IP68) and offers perks like stereo speakers and amazing battery life. Unlike the Galaxy S5, the Z3 Compact is getting Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone carries the full Z3 camera - a large (1/2.3") sensor with 20.7MP resolution and 2160p video capture. Who said small phones have poor specs?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300 phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What of the Sony Xperia XA, Sony did say the X-series will replace the Zs. The thing is, with Sony's usual premium pricing the mid-range XA costs as much as a Z3. And you're only getting a 5" 720p screen, a mid-range chipset, a lower-spec'd 13MP/1080p camera, smaller battery, no stereo speakers, no water resistance... All in all, the Xperia XA is hardly a great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A better option is the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo. It features the same screen and same waterproofing, plus a 16MP camera with a brighter aperture (f/1.9), but it can't record 2160p video. Coming over a year later than the S5, the Neo version stands a better chance of getting a software update. So it depends on pricing - at the same price get the S5, if the S5 Neo is discounted then it's a viable option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X3 is an interesting offering in the 5.5" 1080p range. It has stereo speakers and a 21MP/2160p camera, a fingerprint reader, plus a microSD slot that was missing on the Meizu MX5. If you're okay with the plastic body, then the Vibe X3 makes a solid alternative to the storage-strapped MX5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 5X appears similar to the Meizu MX5 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 - metal body, 5.5" 1080p screen, fingerprint reader, quad-core processor. The chipset is slower (the GPU especially) and you get a regular 13MP/1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 4c would seem like a solid 5" phone, but it's powered by the same chipset as the Nexus 5X (without the fresh OS) and it doesn't have a microSD slot either. The camera is no match and while the battery is bigger, the battery life isn't any better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 4i has better battery life (67h Endurance), but a weaker chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We skipped its siblings, but the Xiaomi Mi 4s is not easy to overlook. We supposed not long since this is published, the price will fall to the sub-?300 range (it's off by just a few euro) and it's easily better than the 4i and 4c, assuming you can find a unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, c, s, i, what's in a letter? The Mi 4s uses the same Snapdragon 808 chipset as the 4c, but you get 3GB of RAM as standard and 64GB of storage, plus (!) a microSD slot. This is the big thing - the others have limited storage, this is well above average. And for once, the hybrid slot isn't such a hassle, even if you use a second SIM you're still left with plenty of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still get a 5" 1080p screen, a 13MP/1080p camera, but the 3,260mAh battery offers better endurance (almost a day over the 4c). The Xiaomi Mi 4s is the only one of the three with a fingerprint reader too. So, while it's ?50 or so pricier, you really get your money's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 is in the same "just over ?300" category and it too is a metal-clad phone. It has a slightly bigger screen, at 5.2" 1080p, and you're getting an Android 6.0 Marshmallow update. The GPU performance is nothing special and the battery life is not as good as the Mi 4s'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera sounds more impressive with a 1/2.4" sensor with 20MP resolution, though it still tops out at 1080p videos, which are of very poor quality. At least the selfie cam is higher resolution (8MP vs. 5MP). There are a couple of versions - both with 3GB RAM and a microSD slot while the built-in storage is a choice between 16GB, 32GB (for the Enhanced version) and 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We talked about the Galaxy S5 in the previous chapter, but for less than ?50 more you can get the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). Sure, it's not water proof, but it looks better with its metal frame and two 2.5D Gorilla Glass panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP f/1.9 camera also has optical image stabilization, which didn't arrive in the S-series until the S6. The chipset is nothing special though, and so you lose 2160p video. Unlike the Galaxy S5, though, the Marshmallow update for this one is yet to be confirmed. Also, the battery is sealed, but you get more mileage out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One A9 is an all-metal alternative to the Galaxy, with an excellent 5" 1080p AMOLED screen to boot. Also, it launched on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, so no worrying about upgrades, and its 13MP camera has OIS (but can't record 2160p video either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone will lead the midrange of HTCs offerings, with the HTC 10 as the flagship (its design was based on the A9). The battery life is a bit of a disappointment though, the small 2,150mAh unit is only good for 46h between charges. It's pricey compared to the A5 (2016) and downright expensive compared to the (much less attractive) Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A ?100 upgrade over the Z3 Compact, but the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact pays off with a next-gen 23MP camera (1/2.3" sensor) and a new chipset (Snapdragon 810). You also get a fingerprint reader. On the downside, the battery got a small bump in capacity but the new chipset dropped the Endurance to a still-great 86 hours. Also, the sides of the phone do not look as good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to venture into the larger screen sizes, let's go really big - the 6" Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual comes to mind. Besides the large 1080p screen, the phone also boasts a wide-angle 13MP/1080p selfie camera with flash, which is almost identical to the 13MP/1080p camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5 Ultra has relatively slim bezels, but it would never be called "compact." The glossy finish doesn't look great at this size and, more disappointingly, you only get a 2,930mAh battery that offers 62h of Endurance (56h if you use two SIMs). 1080p video quality is not perfect and there's no 2160p option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's reign in the size and look at a couple of upgrades over the previous chapter. The LG G4 improves the image quality of its 5.5" QHD screen compared to the G3. The camera is an even bigger improvement and the 16MP optically stabilized shooter produced some of the best photos and 2160p videos we saw last year. It has a bright f/1.8 lens and Laser AF to help out the big 1/2.6" sensor and the video mode has extensive manual controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is slightly curved and we're particularly fond of the genuine leather back options (a feature normally reserved for much more expensive phones; the plastic cover isn't very nice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Style builds on the X Play from the previous chapter. It has a bigger, sharper screen, at 5.7" QHD, and a more powerful chipset (same as the G4). It features the same IP52-certified water resistant coating too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does improve the camera with 2160p video and the 5MP selfie cam has an LED flash. The Moto X Style also boasts stereo speakers around the screen. Not bad for a ?100 upgrade. If you're ready to spend a bit extra, the Motomaker offers leather and wood back options too, so you get more choices than even the LG G4 offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400 we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One M9 falls in this price range as the One A9 and it offers stereo speakers, faster chipset and a 20MP camera with 2160p videos over the A9. The former flagship has a similar 5" 1080p screen (LCD) and better battery life to boot, plus an upgrade to Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately for HTC, the One M9 never found much success and it represents an end of the line. The phone had its issues - unstable performance (throttling kicks in after the S810 chipset heats up), the camera produces noisy photos and the 2160p videos are not the best, the bezels around the screen make the phone bigger than a 5" handset needs to be. Still, some might pick it over the A9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the OnePlus 2. The brand has some dedicated fans, but we just didn't find its second-generation device compelling enough to pick over the LG G4. They are both different and similar at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus 2 boasts a 5.5" screen (but 1080p), a Snapdragon 810 chipset (but downclocked), a 2160p camera with OIS and Laser AF (but 13MP stills), 64GB storage option (but no microSD slot), optional wood and carbon backs, the list goes on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this chapter we skipped the Huawei G8 because the Honor 5X is just better value, the Huawei Mate S deserves more attention. It boasts a 5.5" screen - an AMOLED! - in its all-metal body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're fans of AMOLED, the Mate S just doesn't offer enough over the 5X to justify the price premium of about ?150. It still has a 13MP/1080p camera (with a bigger sensor and OIS, though), the chipset is faster, but the battery capacity and life dropped.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is a surprisingly busy chapter, we ended up recommending almost all phones that we had shortlisted. In this segment it's AMOLED-galore, big ones too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a year younger than the Note 3 (which was in the middle of the ?200-?300 segment) and it feels much more like a modern smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame of the phone is now actual metal (instead of chrome-painted plastic) and the 5.7" Super AMOLED screen got sharper (to QHD resolution). The new panel offers higher image quality while the S Pen was redesigned to be slimmer yet with superior grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a big 16MP sensor (1/2.6") with optical image stabilization and 2160p video. You get modern goodies like a fingerprint reader and a heart rate monitor. Inside the Galaxy Note 4 is a faster chipset and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The removable battery offers a tangible bump in battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is the competing neighbor. It has a 5.7" QHD screen (an LCD, one of two on this page) and a precursor to the Always On screen that the G5 introduced, namely a dedicated strip on top that can stay on to display the time and notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to this fairly unique strip of screen is a fairly unique dual-camera setup. Like the G5, the cameras are split into narrow (80°) and wide (120°) but, unlike it, this one is specifically for selfies. The main 16MP camera with f/1.8 aperture and OIS is a refinement of the LG G4 camera and not too different from the main LG G5 camera. You get a premium pair of AKG headphones in the box too!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 may not be as pretty as the leather-backed G4, but some will appreciate its rugged looks. The phone is actually rugged too - not waterproof, but it has MIL-STD-810G certification for shock resistance. It earns this with two layers of Gorilla Glass 4 over the screen and internal bumpers, in short it was built to take a hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola lost its Nexus gig, but not before producing the wonderful Nexus 6. The phone is relatively compact for its sizable 6" screen - a QHD AMOLED - even though it's flanked with stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Note 4 and V10, we're looking at a metal frame and plastic back but this one has Motorola's basic water resistance (splashes are OK, but don't dunk it). Being a Nexus, of course you get a clean new Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Note that we'd go for the 64GB model as there's no microSD slot and often you don't save much cash by going with the 32GB model (we've seen as little as ?10 difference).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is a 13MP unit with 1.4µm pixels, smaller than the 1.55µm that the Nexus 6P got, but this one has OIS to help it in the dark along with a dual-LED ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S6 caught a lot of flack for dropping the microSD slot, removable battery and water resistance of the S5. The new Galaxy S7 resolves two thirds of those issues, but it's still a good deal more expensive and you're getting mostly the same design and 5.1" QHD Super AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP f/1.9 camera is quite good - not as good as the new 12MP camera on the S7 for night shooting but still - and the while the battery is a good deal smaller, the difference in battery life isn't that huge. You get a fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor, two-mode wireless charger and so on. If you can't afford to splash for an S7, the Galaxy S6 is a solid fallback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the camera-focused, the Microsoft Lumia 950 offers an alternative. It has a 20MP camera with f/1.9 Zeiss optics and optical image stabilization, but ups the ante with a triple-LED RGB flash. There are cinematic 24fps modes for video, four directional microphones for great audio and expandable storage to put it all on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows 10 Platform offers Continuum - a way to hook up the Lumia 950 as if it was a desktop computer, complete with windowed app support (you'll need a dock). There's no fingerprint reader, instead you get the more futuristic (but slower) iris scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an excellent 5.2" AMOLED screen of QHD resolution, so the only disappointment is the battery life - 48h of Endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you winced while reading about the 6" Nexus 6, then maybe the Apple iPhone SE is the one for you - a resurgence of the 4" iPhone. It combines the body and screen of the iPhone 5c with the camera and chipset of the iPhone 6s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some sacrifices were made - there's no 3D Touch, the fingerprint reader is the slower, older generation, the selfie camera is just 1.2MP. This is the only premium 4" phone left around (with the bezels, the Xperia Z5 Compact isn't much bigger). To be fair, the phone is ?100 below what we expected it would cost, but you still have to pay that ?100 premium to get the 64GB storage (iOS eats too much of the 16GB storage).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500 phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We started off this section with the Meizu PRO 5 and as we were about to call it a dream phone, we realized we said the same of the Meizu MX5. Both have metal bodies, 1080p AMOLED screens, big-sensored 21MP cameras with 2160p videos, octa-core processor, fingerprint readers, dual-SIM connectivity and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PRO 5 is clearly the better phone - the screen is bigger (5.7" vs. 5.5"), the chipset is faster and crucially you get a microSD slot, plus the battery life is much better (95h vs. 55h).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Meizu PRO 5 costs more than double (!) what the MX5 costs. The PRO 5 is a solid alternative to the Note 5, V10 and Nexus, but if we're buying a Meizu, we'd get the MX5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?500-?600<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter, we ended up leaving more on the cutting floor than promoting to recommended status. It was usually one of two things - we already covered a more affordable phone that's almost as good or a niche device without mass appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 6P by Huawei improves on the Moto Nexus with an all-metal body and added fingerprint scanning (legend has it the Nexus 6 fingerprint was dropped at the last moment). The QHD AMOLED is smaller, despite the name the phone has a 5.7" screen. You get to keep the stereo speakers (not the basic water resistance, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new 12.3 camera is amazing for low-light photos and videos thanks to its large pixels (1.55µm), even though it lost the OIS functionality. You get a much more capable 8MP selfie camera too (up from 2MP).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ is a late 2015 addition to the S6 family. It draws the same comparisons with the Galaxy S7 edge as the S6 did with the S7. Sure, grab the S7 edge if you can afford it, but that will be almost ?200 more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still get a brilliant, curved Super AMOLED screen of QHD resolution, slightly bigger to boot (5.7" vs. 5.5"), a capable camera and a fast chipset. Not as capable and as fast, but the differences don't always justify the price premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You suffer from the usual S6 issues, though, no microSD slot and sealed battery. So consider the Galaxy Note 4 as an alternative - more affordable, no such issues, but not quite as attractive (the curved screen is unique to look at).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi was last seen in this guide with the Mi 4s, but the Xiaomi Mi 5 is a phone that can truly challenge the 2016 flagships and it comes at a 2015 flagship price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a metal frame and a brilliant 5.15" screen, 1080p (for all the difference it makes at this size), a Snapdragon 820 chipset like the Galaxy S7, a 16MP f/2.0 camera with OIS and 2160p videos, fingerprint reader on the front, curved glass on the back, plus excellent battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD slot though, we found the 128GB model closer to ?500 than ?600. It's video recording that's the real issue - we were shocked at how bad the 1080p videos were (4K are okay) and the poor audio recording.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?500-?600 phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What is Sony doing? The Xperia Z5 hover&#x441; just over ?500, but it's a small upgrade over the Z3+, which wasn't good enough to pick over the Z3. Is the Z5? Well, we start with the same 5.2" 1080p screen (brighter, though), same IP68 water resistance, battery life is better than Z3+ not as good as Z3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the new 23MP camera is better, but continues to exhibit the traditional Sony issues - corner softness, plenty of digital noise, overall not a huge improvement over the older Z3 camera (video stabilization at 1080p is better, but at this price we can have OIS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Xperia X, supposedly the replacement of the Z-series. Early indications were that it will cost around ?600 when it launches, but for whatever reason that hasn't happened yet. Launching late will undoubtedly hurt the phone's sales (even if it launches at a more reasonable price) and, how do we put this tactfully, it's just worse than the Z5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, really. You get a 5" 1080p screen (what is this, 2013?) and while the 23MP camera sounds the same as the Z5, it won't record 2160p video. It's not the Snapdragon 650's fault, so we're not sure what happened. This is a midrange chipset, by the way. We'd pick it over the Snapdragon 810 in the Z5, but why is this even a discussion (for this much cash Snapdragon 820 was to be expected).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and you don't get water resistance. Stereo speakers sure, but no IP68. A snazzy 13MP selfie camera with a 1/3" sensor (the size of the main sensor in the iPhone 6s!), but we still can't shake the feeling that Sony is self-sabotaging itself with that pricing strategy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's change topic - how about those 6" screens, you a fan? Because we have a trio that might interest you. First off, the Samsung Galaxy A9 has a beautiful all-metal body and a 6" 1080p super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you can have a Huawei Mate 8, also metal with 6" 1080p screen. The A9 has a mid-range chipset so we can understand how its 13MP camera is capped at 1080p, but Huawei's Kirin 950 is a high end chipset and yet the 16MP camera can't do 2160p either. Both cameras have OIS, by the way. You also get sizable 4,000mAh batteries and 100+ hour Endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wanna go bigger? We can go bigger! The Huawei P8max has a whopping 6.8" screen (still 1080p). It uses an older Kirin and its 13MP OIS-enabled camera records, you guessed it, 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 950 XL offers a saner 5.7" AMOLED screen and it has QHD resolution! Wait until you hear the 2160p mode of the 20MP camera (with optically stabilized Zeiss lens) too!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have this one below the fold, because we're not sure about the longevity of the Windows 10 Platform. After years of struggling to take up any significant market share, we're starting to see app developers call it quits. So we're a little hesitant to commit flagship money to the platform.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?600 and over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple and Samsung dominate high-end sales so they are unavoidable in this price segment, but that's not to say there are no worthwhile alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start with the Samsung Galaxy S7. It launched first, it has top specs and is priced very competitively. It is everything we wanted the Galaxy S6 to be - water proof (IP68), with good battery life and expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 has the best mobile camera on the market right now. The Dual Pixel autofocus is matched by none (it's rare even among DSLRs), but it obliterates any other phone in terms of speed and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large-ish pixels and brightest yet aperture (f/1.7, previous best was f/1.8), not to mention OIS, all make for great image quality in the dark. The S7 camera also records some of the best 2160p video from the current crop of flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there is some different hardware inside the S7s - some regions get a Snapdragon 820 chipset, others Exynos 8890, some get a Sony IMX260 camera sensor others come with Samsung ISOCELL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some tests show the Exynos version is significantly faster in multitasking, but the cameras perform pretty much identically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7 was launched simultaneously as two phones - the S7 above and the Galaxy S7 edge. This one has a larger, 5.5" Super AMOLED screen that's curved at both sides. The edge screen also comes with some additional software offering extra functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both S7 screens have Always On mode, which shows the time, battery charge and missed calls and messages. Only calls and messages, no third party apps get to display notifications here. This feature costs you 1% battery charge an hour, but it's much brighter and more legible than the Always On option on the LG G5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is really the major difference between the two S7 - the S7 edge has the same choice of chipsets, same great camera, same waterproofing and so on. So it's a question of whether you want a bigger screen and if you're willing to pay for it. The aesthetics shouldn't be neglected, the edge screen gives the phone a unique look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 launched a bit behind the S7, but it brings two unique features. One is the modular design - the bottom of the metal body can be removed (letting you access the battery and microSD card) and a module can be inserted back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far there are two modules - a camera grip with an extra battery and hardware controls and a Bang &amp; Olufsen DAC for superior audio quality (not available in the US). Neither of these is enough to really sell the G5 based on its modularity, we'll see what third parties come up with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second unique feature is the dual camera. Like on the V10 (but this time on the back) you get a narrow (80°) and wide (120°) cameras. The narrow camera is an enhancement of the 16MP G4 and V10 camera, complete with f/1.8 aperture, OIS and excellent low-light performance. The wide camera is a fixed-focus 8MP shooter that can also do 2160p videos. The difference in field of view is huge, it will change the way you shoot photos and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 went with a 5.3" QHD screen, slightly smaller than G4's and in between the two S7s. It has an always on mode too and it uses less battery than Samsung's solution but is noticeably dimmer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming soon (in May) is the HTC 10 - hopefully HTC's return to the days when it made the best Androids around. The all-metal phone has an HTC One inspired design and a 5.2" QHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is a second generation UltraPixel - 12 million pixels (bigger than the ones in the S7), behind a bright f/1.8 aperture and optically stabilized to boot. This could be the king of low-light shooting, but HTC's tardiness means we haven't had a chance to test it properly against the S7 and Nexus 6P.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 10 also has a unique feature up its sleeve - the world's first selfie camera with optical image stabilization. The camera has fairly big pixels (1.36µm, slightly smaller than S7's main camera pixels), an f/1.8 aperture and a 23mm/86° lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BoomSound is back and revamped, too. Two speakers serve as a tweeter and a woofer respectively, promising an even better sound from everyone's favorite Android boombox. HTC loaded the 10 with a High-Res DAC (no need to spend $150 on a B&amp;O DAC) and it comes with Hi-res headphones in the box too (not in the US though). For its 2160p videos, the camera also records such high-quality audio - 24-bit, 96kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pricey as usual and late to the party, but the HTC 10 may well be worth waiting for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a slightly older alternative to these 2016 flagships - the Motorola Moto X Force has a 5.4" AMOLED (QHD, of course), a 21MP camera with 1.4µm pixels and 2160p video, a 5MP selfie cam with dedicated flash, runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow on a Snapdragon 810 chipset and packs a large 3,76mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "X Force" name sounds kind of like a covert action team and the phone lives up to that name with a shatterproof display, water repellent coating and a "Ballistic Nylon" back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We left out the iPhones, but our commenters made it clear they are sought after devices. So here they are - not value for money, but if you want an iPhone (and the SE is too tiny) then you really have little choice but to go with an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. This generation the new features were a bit lackluster - 3D Touch didn't set the world on fire - but incremental improvements like the the move to a 12MP camera with OIS and 2160p video capture does make a difference. With the iPhones you get a solid screen - 5.5" 1080p in the case of the iPhone 6s Plus - fast chipset and rich software ecosystem with update longer than any Android can hope for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller iPhone 6s offers a 4.7" screen with just around 720p resolution, not very sharp (the colors and contrast of the screen are great, though). This model also lacks the optical image stabilization on the camera that its Plus sibling enjoys. And yet the iPhone 6s is easily more popular than the 6s Plus</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?600+ phones we skipped and why<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note5 can be seen as a possible alternative to the Galaxy S7 edge, but it bears the limitations of the S6 generation - no microSD slot, no waterproofing. Sure, you get a slightly bigger screen and the S Pen, but they come with the older chipset and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For these reasons we think it's more prudent to wait a few months for the Galaxy Note6 or grab the S7 edge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Parting words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're probably among the people who spend more on their phones than our average reader - we're passionate about handsets and we're constantly exposed to and tempted by the latest tech. That said, we can see how splashing on the next flagship is not necessarily everyone's only alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High-end phones are good enough to last an extra year before upgrading if the new generation isn't to taste (e.g. Galaxy S6's lack of waterproofing and microSD or the Xperia Z3+, which is a questionable upgrade over the Z3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Midrangers sometimes outshine year-old flagships so instead of waiting for a flagship's price to settle in, you can jump on a midranger this year and upgrade again the next year. You just can't upgrade flagships this often if you're on a budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even cheap phones are perfectly serviceable if you're not picky about screen and especially the camera. This makes them a great pick for your parents - just make sure the battery life is reliable and they will be happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you've been in the biz long enough, you notice that phones carry "family quirks" - basically things like odd photo processing or peculiar screen behavior will let you know who made the phone without even looking at the logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brand loyalty is a good thing in that you know what you're getting - considering the amount of time you'll spend on your phone, even a small quirk can become a major annoyance. On the other hand, experimenting may help you discover great new things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even if you're the kind of person who likes surprises, it always works best if you know what you're looking for.</paragraph>
