			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stuff floating in the wake of a flagship - minis, phablets, all sorts of spinoffs. Everyone does it, trying to capitalize on the novelty and the excitement. Meizu moves in a different way. To begin with, it has what's probably the smallest squad for the season. A couple of flagships (the MX4 pair) and a couple of phablets (the brand new M1 series).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A small lineup, but not lacking quality. More importantly though, it's been put together with a purpose. The m1 note will try and make a splash outside Asia with flagship-worthy hardware at an entry-level price, while the regular m1 is helping Meizu tap the vast Indian market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note was a hot topic in our rumor section for quite a while only to see its interest rating spike twofold following the official announcement. At those prices that hardware can get anyone's attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While most other midrange phones still offer 720p displays, and are powered by Snapdragon 400's or the fresh Snapdragon 410, the Meizu m1 note boasts a 5.5" 1080p display and an octa-core processor from MediaTek. There's 2GB of RAM, a capable 13MP camera and a fat 3,140mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu phones have often been criticized for having too much Apple in them. The Flyme skin with no app drawer is heavily influenced by iOS and so is the phone's design. On the other hand, Meizu's build quality has always been solid and the spec sheet is flagship grade - the Apple-like user experience and looks are probably meant to count as a bonus, if you're that kind of person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note is a typical Meizu in that it lacks a microSD slot. The smaller Meizu m1 will be the very first phone from the Chinese maker to have one. The India-bound Meizu m1 has 8GB of inbuilt storage, while the m1 note starts at 16GB and Meizu will double that for you for $30 extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD slot has a number of benefits such as local backup, easier ROM installation, or just faster data transfers. Another Apple-inspired decision or just the way Meizu does things makes little difference in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User-replaceable batteries are close to becoming extinct, which is another piece of bad news no doubt for users who value that level of flexibility. For the price, the Meizu m1 note can be forgiven a few things but we do hope the list isn't too long. We'll know soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Meizu m1 note<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note comes in a rather big package conaining an A/C adapter (2A) and a USB cable. In some markets there'll be headphones in the bundle too (there's a dedicated compartment which, again, was empty in our case).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Meizu m1 note 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 150.7 x 75.2 x 8.9mm, for a weight of 145g, the Meizu m1 note has the same width, thickness and weight as the 5.36" Meizu MX4, being as tall as the MX4 Pro, which too features a 5.5" display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The moment we laid our hands on the Meizu m1 note, the iPhone 5c came to mind. The glossy plastic rear cover comes in a bunch of fresh colors: white, blue, yellow, green and pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note's entire front is protected by a piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The 5.5" IGZO display enjoys nearly 73% of the available space - not as impressive as the MX4's screen-to-body ratio but close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the signature capacitive Home key. The rest is a single non-removable cover made of glossy plastic - it doesn't look bad at all but it's prone to smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the iPhone 5c, the Meizu m1 note comes in a variety of colors and the similarities don't end there. Look at the bottom of the phone - the screws, the primary mic, the port and even the loudspeaker grille. The only difference is the placement of the audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we don't quite like about the Meizu m1 note is the Power/Lock key position at the top of the phone. Since the m1 note is rather big with a 5.5" display, it's nearly impossible to reach for the key while keep a secure grip on the phone single-handedly. Double-tap to unlock is a welcome workaround. There's Gesture wake up too - you can use pre-defined gestures to launch different apps from a turned off screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's just enough gloss for good looks, but the grip is somewhat compromised. The Meizu m1 note is slippery and its curved edges don't add for a secure hold either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you try to reach for the top-placed Lock key with the hand operating the device it'll probably end up on the floor. Overall, the Meizu m1 note looks good and is reasonably sized for the screen diagonal, but the positive first impressions might be undone by the slippery and smudge-prone rear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a small earpiece with a bunch of discreet sensors and a 5MP selfie cam. Below the 5.5" screen is the capacitive Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Meizu m1 note has the two separate volume keys, while the SIM card compartment is on the right. You'll need the pin from your retail box to pop it open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has another microphone for noise cancellation, the seldom-used power button and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Oddly. the secondary mic isn't used for stereo video recording and is only meant for calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is over at the bottom, as is the loudspeaker grille and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features the 13MP Samsung camera lens and the dual-tone LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear panel is not removable and you cannot access the battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Meizu m1 note is a joy to look at. Its colors are nicely saturated and the viewing angles are very good. The IGZO panel is made by Sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution is a treat for the price and more than sufficient at 1080p. 403ppi is sharp enough and you wouldn't really tell the difference to any QHD screen on the market unless you're looking at some really small fonts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the Meizu m1 note display matrix - it has a standard RGB arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note has a reasonably good display. Its black levels are questionable at 100% brightness but not enough to look truly bad. The brightness itself is very good at a notch above 550 nits. The contrast is only average though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the smartphone employs a familiar technique of automatically adjusting the brightness when not set to 100% even when you turned the auto brightness option off. This is why we couldn't give you results for the display at 50% brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outdoors, the Meizu m1 note is an average performer in terms of sunlight legibility. The glass on top of the display is quite reflective.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note is powered by a 3,140mAh battery. In our test, the Meizu m1 note managed to score an average rating of 66 hours of battery life. It posted very solid numbers in the 3G call test, web browser endurance and video playback, while the stand-by performance is only average. This means the Meizu m1 note will last two and a half days and then some, if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note offers three battery modes - power-saving (four CPU cores only), balanced (six CPU cores) and performance (access to all eight CPU cores). We tested it at Performance mode and Balanced modes (the results are smilar), so you may be able to squeeze even more from the battery, when the m1 note is set on Power-Saving mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our testing procedure includes a standby battery endurance test, which is not shown in the scorecard above, but is a part of the overall rating. You can learn more about our standardized routine here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSDPA and HSUPA, as well as quad-band LTE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note has dual-SIM, dual-standby functionality - 3G and LTE are supported only on SIM1, while SIM2 can tap into 2G GSM networks only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note has dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, so you can play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA-compatible TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 is also on board with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also stream your display via the Wireless Display feature (Miracast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS and GLONASS support is enabled. There's no FM Radio, IR port or NFC on the Meizu m1 note, there is no wired TV-out option either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flyme skins Android KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note comes with the custom-made Flyme OS, now in its 4.2 installment. It's based on Android KitKat 4.4.4 and it takes after its Chinese siblings from MiUI and others and has a one-level interface with only homescreen and no app drawer, similarly to Apple's iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick look at Flyme OS 4.2 on the Meizu m1 note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Meizu m1 note is a pretty simple affair. You drag upwards to unlock and have the option of securing it with a passcode or an unlock pattern. There are no shortcuts on the lockscreen, but and you use left and right swipes to launch apps - the left gesture by default launches the camera. A swipe to the right can bring up a predefined app, a swipe down will bring down the notification area and a swipe upward will unlock the phone into the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding down the home button will lock back the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign a number of functions to tapping the home button - you can set it go back in the UI, close an app or go back to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is simpler still. You get two panes by default but you can add more later on. The homescreen gathers all of your app icons and you can add widgets into the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from adding widgets you can also align the app icons to either the top or the bottom of the screen - a step up from the iOS homescreen, which has a mind of its own in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area pulls down the whole way. You get a set of five circular toggles for various settings and you can expand them with a swipe down or with the dedicated virtual button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the notification area is a basic list or expandable, actionable notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu on the Meizu m1 note is laid out in a tabbed interface, with the main categories on the left and the related options on the right. In the default view, the settings categories are just icons but a swipe will reveal their full names if you can't find what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the UI with various themes. There are some preloaded but you can browse the App Center for more - some of them are paid but there are many free and a lot to choose from. There's also a variety of built in wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Do Not Disturb mode that will block notifications and calls and you can choose a white list of numbers that can get through. It can be scheduled to run at specific time intervals or be set manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flyme OS can be tough to get around at first but once you've gotten your bearings it becomes a treat to work with. Meizu is keeping things as simple as possible and everything works seamlessly without any hiccups.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note utilizes a MediaTek MT6752 chipset with eight Cortex-A53 cores ticking at 1.7GHz and Mali-T760MP2 GPU - that's the same GPU Samsung put inside the Galaxy S6 though just dual-core (S6 hast the octa-core configuration). The RAM is at 2GB so overall, it's a very respectable system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note offers a few battery modes. For the benchmarks we used the Performance mode (as opposed to Balanced and Power-saving), which should, in theory, give us the best results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It topped the GeekBench 3 table with a very respectable result. It also posted a very good AnTuTu 5 score, slightly behind the Meizu MX4 and (faster) Lenovo Vibe X2. In Basemark OS II the Meizu MX4 showed a great multi-core performance, which is the usual for eight-core chipsets. However the single core the overall score wasn't as spectacular.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound BaseMark OS II 2.0 test puts the Meizu m1 note on the runner-up spot, bested only by the OnePlus One.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though OnePlus One runs on a quad-core Krait 400 processor, it still outperforms the octa-core Cortex-A53 powering the m1 note. Oddly, the Meizu m1 note did slightly worse than the Galaxy A7, which has a slower Cortex-A53 processor.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu m1 note utilizes a powerful Mali-T760MP2 GPU, but unlike the octa-core MP8 flavor embedded within the Galaxy S6, the m1 note relies only on two T760 cores. This doesn't sound as a hardware cut for high-end 1080p gaming, but let's see the benchmark results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GFX Bench outs the same results for the onscreen and 1080p off-screen tests, but that's to be expected as both run in 1080p resolution. The m1 note GPU configuration seems adequate, outdone only by the OnePlus One's Adreno 330 and Lenovo Vibe X2's PowerVR 6200.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Unfortunately the web browsing performance turned out quite poor in both browser tests - the JavaScript benchmark Kraken and the compound BrowserMark 2.1. Maybe you should look for an alternative to the default browser, such as Chrome.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu m1 note provides more than adequate performance for the class and honestly, more for what you'd expect for your cash. It does very well when it comes to CPU and GPU performance, while the Android OS is blazingly-fast and hiccup-free. Our only concerns are with the default MX web browser, but you can always opt for a different browsing app from the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At its core, the phonebook on the Meizu m1 note is a list of all contacts but you can view only a specific group or filter where contracts come from - phone contacts, email account or a Meizu account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't add Facebook or Twitter or any social network out of the box. Installing the Facebook or Twitter app will allow you to sync your contacts from there. You can link contacts, but the functionality is annoyingly limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook will automatically link contacts with the same name, but that's it. You can't manually link or unlink contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note has all reception bars full and held onto signal great even in tighter spots. Call quality is very good with loud and clear sound on both ends of the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features smart dialing, which is nice. Otherwise it doesn't differ from any other in functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note passed our loudspeaker test with a Good mark, but the speaker quality is very poor and while playing music, the m1 note subjectively sounds really quiet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simplistic messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just New message, Search and Settings buttons. Above is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, the input field starts out at only one line tall, but will grow to up to seven lines if need be. Left of the text box is a button that handles attachments and smileys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a smile, a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Batch operations are enabled for multiple threads - Mark as spam and Delete are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu has tweaked the generic email client. It supports multiple Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. Just swipe out the side-placed menu and you get all your folders plus your accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's support for batch operations - Mark, Filter and Delete are the available options. Filter acts against spam to weed out unwanted email senders. There's also the option to switch to threaded view in which case an icon appears alongside the name of each thread, giving you the number of messages inside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Meizu m1 note is nicely laid out and has a four-row interface. There's a dedicated numeric view with a numpad-like style but we would have preferred the numbers as a line on top of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between keyboard styles, send Meizu and text smileys and have an option to choose between many languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can always download a third party keyboard if you wish, there are many on the Google Play store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clean gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Flyme gallery has two viewing modes - photo and gallery. The photo stacks images into months while the gallery puts them into folders. You can add or remove folders from the gallery and also search through it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an image feels a lot like the iOS gallery. By default the bars around an image are white with the content controls but upon a tap they turn black and lose all controls so you can focus on the image at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a built-in editor that offers filters and all the basic controls for contrast, brightness and you can even add blur or vignette. You cannot use different editors from the stock gallery and would need to install a third-party gallery (like Google's Photos) to have different editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player supports Dirac HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player can only find tracks located in the music folder. You can browse your collection the traditional way or you can select to have it filtered by folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first case tracks are sorted into several playlists like All songs, Recently added, Folders and you have the option to create custom playlists. When viewing All songs you can choose between three types of sorting in a tabbed layout: song name, artist and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music controls are at the bottom of the screen. Choosing an artist will show you all the albums and corresponding songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the equalizer from the advanced menu. It features several presets, which you can edit manually - but you need to insert the headphones first.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note comes with a dedicated Video app, but it expects videos to be placed in the video folder. You can use the file browser or gallery to get videos to play from elsewhere - it offers thumbnails and everything so we ended up using it more often than the Video app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a pop-out option that allows you to view the video as an overlay to the OS. It's quite limited compared to Samsung and LG's modes for pop up play as you don't get any resizing or opacity controls - just play controls and the option to move the video around the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall movies played without issues up to 1080p resolution on the m1 note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is excellently clean, headphones volume low<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Meizu m1 note delivers an excellent performance - matching greatly clean output with just above average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones, however, and volume levels drop to below average, preventing the m1 from getting a perfect score here. On the positive side the output is still nicely clean with a very minor bump in the stereo crosstalk the only notable change there. A solid performance for the entry-level handset here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the detailed results so you can check them out for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good 13MP snapper with a dual-tone LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note has a Samsung 13MP sensor that's capable of capturing some huge 4192x3104px snaps in 4:3 aspect. There's also a dual-tone LED flash that should allow for more pleasing colors in low light flash photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface by default launches into Auto mode where the camera determines the shooting parameters. You have the option to turn on HDR (but no automatic HDR), gridlines for the viewfinder and a level gauge so that your horizon isn't off tilt. There's also an option to enable a timer of either 3, 5 or 10 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a side-scrollable mode dial at the top of the camera UI but you can also tap it to get a full view of the shooting modes - all seven of them. These are Auto, Manual (where you can set the shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation and even the focus - from macro to infinity), Beauty (which can make eyes bigger, faces slimmer, skin smoother and lighter), Panorama, Light field (which is Meizu's refocus app allowing you to defocus any part of the scene), Scan (for QR and barcodes), and Slowmotion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what manual mode looks like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note snaps very good 13MP shots. The samples have plenty of resolved detail, the dynamic range is very good and the noise levels are kept reasonably low. We noticed no processing defects. The colors are sometimes a bit colder than in reality, but that's just a minor issue. The contrast is very good, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is meant to get a more even exposure of a scene - bringing back detail in the highlights and the shadows. On the Meizu m1 note it does okay to bring back some highlight detail but mostly leaves the shadows untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas aren't too impressive on the Meizu m1 note. There is plenty of resolution and good overall exposure but the detail isn't as good as in the regular stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can check out a 5MP image taken with the front-facing camera of the device. It doesn't shine with too much detail but it would do a great job for selfies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note shoots videos up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. There's no 60fps smooth motion option but you do get a 720p@100fps slow motion shooting mode that is rendered for playback as a slow motion 25fps video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All videos from the m1 note camera are stored in MP4 containers, the video bitrate is about 12Mpbs and the framerate is stable. The audio is only mono, which is odd as the phone has two microphones on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate stays firmly at 30fps and we got almost no dropped frames. The resolved detail isn't as great as on the still images, but will do in most occasions. The dynamic range and contrast are very good though, as is the color reproduction. The oversharpening might be a bit of an issue at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also directly download the 1080p@30fps (00:14s, 32.0MB) video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Default MX browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser plays a central role in the Meizu m1 note as evidenced by its shortcut's position - the middle shortcut in the dock at the bottom of the homescreen, which is usually where the app drawer shortcut goes (or the dialer shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface dedicates almost the entire screen to the web page, save for the status bar on top and a tiny bar on the bottom for Refresh, Tabs and Bookmarks. Choosing Tabs opens a quick pop up preview of your open tabs instead of bringing up an entirely new screen, which is great as it still leaves the website your on in plain view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming. It's really fast and fluid too. There are also goodies like text reflow or sharing an URL over email or SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's even a Reading mode that looks exactly like the one on the Apple iPhone. Normally we're against copying but the feature is a no-brainer that we'd like to see added to every major browser out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note features a calendar that supports multiple online accounts. It offers monthly, weekly, daily and agenda views and is pretty straightforward to work with. Creating a new event lets you set which calendar to store it in, along with a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has a very minimal, clean look but retains all the functionality you'd expect. You can also go for the Google Calendar - it's available for download as a separate app from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we have the Clock app that will handle multiple alarms with custom repeat times, ringtones, snooze time and labels. There are also a stopwatch and timer integrated within the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator app is also on board. Interestingly you can use it as an overlay to the homescreen. You can't manually resize it but you can choose between two size settings. It offers a currency converter too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app is clean and simple. You can add notes, images and even check lists into it. The Painter app will let you paint with a number of virtual tools, choosing different colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Center works with only Chinese content but you can still use it, if you can read Chinese, that is. Thankfully, the Google Play store came preinstalled on our device so we got our apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled file manager lets you browse through the memory of the Meizu m1 note or through Recents, or through different media types - music, videos, pictures, etc. It allows copy, cut and paste and also sharing of files on your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the latest version of Google Maps comes pre-installed, so you can use it for navigation, offline maps, places suggestions, among the other cool features it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu m1 note turned out to be everything we hoped for - it has the looks, it utilizes a snappy processor and powerful graphics accelerator, there is a big and capable display, and even the camera did great. The Flyme launcher is getting better and it even smuggled in an Android Lollipop feature to its KitKat build - pinning apps in the app switcher. We loved the Flyme OS user experience. It sure has borrowed a lot from iOS, but we didn't mind that as much as we thought we would. It's a simple and clean user interface, snappy and lag-free.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>What's best about the Meizu m1 note is the pricing - its official price in China is about $160, while you can get it for ?200 in Europe (tax included). And for a mid-ranger with these specs and this screen - it's a bargain. There are phones stuck with a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor and 1GB RAM for double the price!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is what the Meizu m1 note is capable for its ?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu m1 note key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Achilles' heel of the Meizu m1 note is probably the somewhat slippery back cover and the lack of a microSD expansion slot and a removable battery. Everything else seems more than adequate both for the class and the pricing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are quite a few good competitors at about the same price, so is the Meizu m1 note safe out there? Let's find out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus One, now easy to find and purchase, also comes with a 5.5" 1080p display and a slightly better Snapdragon 801 chip. It has proven as an excellent performer and worthy of its money, plus it has more RAM and makes use of 4K video recording. Its base model comes with 16GB storage, but if you need more - you can opt for the 64GB flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> OnePlus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 costs the same as the Meizu m1 note, but is inferior in every key aspect. Its highlight is the front LED flash accompanying the selfie camera, but as we found out - its image quality is hardly stellar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia C3 ? Sony Xperia C3 Dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo Vibe X2 on the other hand is looking absolutely gorgeous. It has a smaller 5" 1080p display and thus higher pixel density, runs on a more powerful chip with an octa-core CPU, comes with 32GB storage by default, and matches the m1 note camera department. If the smaller screen isn't an issue, the Vibe X2 can easily outrun the m1 note in almost everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo Vibe X2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus Zenfone 2 ZE550ML costs the same as the m1 note, offers a big 5.5" 720p display and even better CPU and GPU performance courtesy of the powerful Intel Atom Z3560 GPU. It also matches the camera department of the m1 note, its connectivity options, its battery and even its price. Oh, and the Zenfone 2 ZE550ML already runs on Android Lollipop and features a memory expansion slot.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you need an even more powerful device, you should check the Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML (a ral mouthful, right?) - it packs a 5.5" 1080p display, runs on the beasty Intel Atom Z3580 with a 2.3GHz processors and 2 or 4GB or RAM. The rest of the features are the same as on Zenfone 2 ZE550ML, but it will set you back about ?270.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the recently launched Samsung Galaxy A7 with a 6mm thin profile, a metal frame and a 5.5" Super AMOLED 1080p display. It runs on the Snapdragon 615 chip with an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM, there is expandable 16GB storage and a 13MP Samsung camera with 1080p video capturing. The superior screen and the more upmarket design however will cost you about ?300.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy A7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 seems quite the upgrade over its predecessor and promises a plethora of new features and cross-platform support. The 5.7" Lumia 640 XL will be among the first to get the new OS, so if you are into Windows, you may want to try that one for size. It's less capable than the Meizu m1 note, but Windows 10 doesn't need as much as Android, so you should be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE ? Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual SIM ? Microsoft Lumia 640 XL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu m1 note isn't the perfect mid-ranger, but it came very close. It's a device you can't meet every day - it offers a very good display, a capable hardware and a great camera, plus you can enjoy a smooth and unique Android experience. The pricing is absolutely spot on and we'd recommend it in a heartbeat. We just hope Meizu expands its availability as wide as possible and as soon as possible.</paragraph>
