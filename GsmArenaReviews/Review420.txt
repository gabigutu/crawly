			<paragraph>Here is the remarkable Samsung phone with classic shape, X700. Its features are so rich that it can face up the best models of the competition. Among others, it features a 1.3 megapixel camera, EDGE Class 10, a microSD memory card slot, and stereo speakers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has always been known for its clamshell mobiles, which dominate its portfolio even nowadays. The last Samsung model with classic shape was Samsung C200, almost impossible to find on store shelves anymore. The new X700 model, however, comes to certify that the South-Korean manufacturer "has not lost all love" for this type of mobile phones and that it is not only clamshells it is good at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung X700</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Class is all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700's dimensions of 108 x 44 x 19 mm and weight of 95 g file it into the category of medium-big and medium-heavy phones. It fits in one's hand pretty comfortably. I appreciate a lot the fact that designers have abandoned unnecessary fashionable whims and have kept to conservative, but still quite attractive looks. Black color together with silver rims conforms perfectly to this decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It fits in well ? comparison to a key and other phones </paragraph>
			<paragraph>All black parts of the phone, except for the keypad, are made of plastic material similar to rubber. In result, the covers are not slippery and there are no fingerprints left on the surface. Construction is solid. It does not creak even if grasped strongly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>From all around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Front cover is divided into two more or less equal parts - one for the display, and one for the keypad. Above the display you will find the manufacturer's logo, as well as a silver band covering the speaker grill. The system connector is situated below the keypad. It is protected by a cap and is of the typical Samsung type. The cap itself is hooked to the phone body and is impossible to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   All-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the device is the swing volume control button and one of the two stereo speakers available in the phone. The right side is much more interesting. Here you will find the microSD (TransFlash) memory card slot, the camera release button, and the earphones connector covered by a practical folding capping strip. In the very top part of the right side is located the second stereo speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Lateral sides ? memory card slot ? earphones connector</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major part of the rear side of the phone is occupied by the battery, which has no cover protection. Above the battery lies a silver ring with the megapixel camera lens, accompanied by a mirror for self-portraits. If you prefer to carry your mobile hung around your neck, use the eyelet located on the oval top part of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;One of the phone's two speakers ? data connector ? built-in camera with a mirror </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700's battery is lithium-polymer and is easy to remove. According to the manufacturer, a single charge of the battery of 800 mAh capacity should be enough for up to 450 hours on stand-by or 450 minutes of calls. Under the battery you will find a tiny drawer. Press it with the edge of your nail to pull out the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Battery goes out smoothly ? battery is not protected ? eyelet</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant displays are Samsung specialty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has always been famous for its brilliant displays. Samsung X700 is no exception to the rule. It has an active TFT display, which displays 262K colors on a surface of 176 x 220 pixels. In terms of contrast, animation speed and color performance this display is among the best ones. On the other hand, it is a bit too embedded and therefore rather dark under direct sunlight. Depiction is extremely fine despite of the larger size of the display (30 x 38 mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Large, top-class display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you leave Samsung X700 inactive for some time, a big digital clock accompanied by the respective date and day of the week appears on the display. Furthermore, smaller icons alert you about the number of received messages and missed calls, without the necessity of activating the display. The only drawback here is that all above mentioned details remain hardly visible under strong light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Display evenly illuminated in the dark</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad scores less<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad is one of the weak links in Samsung X700. Control and menu navigation are performed through the main four-way button with a confirming central part. On both sides of the control button there are two soft keys. Beneath them are the standard green and the red receivers and the correction C button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Main control button ? and its confirming central part</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numeric keys are organized in a block with no spaces. The only feature that helps touch orientation to a certain degree is the cascade form of the keys, that is, the bottom part of each key is slightly elevated if compared to the top part of the key below it. Besides, there are horizontal silver strips above the 2, 5, 8 and 0 keys, which however serve as decorative elements rather than as touch orientation tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Keypad is not absolutely flat ? and may cause you difficulties at the beginning</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to my opinion, the most serious drawback of Samsung X700's keypad are its densely positioned keys. Keys are small and pretty stuck together, which often leads to pressing two neighboring keys at a time, instead of one. That is why I recommend you to use your nails rather than your fingers when you work with the keypad. It is all about getting used to it. A little bit of practice is all you need to start writing smoothly and seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>White backlight behind the keypad </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is evenly illuminated in white. The green and red receiver keys are the only ones to maintain their original color. Samsung X700 offers an interesting function, due to which you can select whether the keypad should always be backlighted when the display is illuminated, or it should get illuminated in evening and night hours only. The time range, in which backlight is active, can be modified from the main menu of the phone. In terms of energy saving the keypad backlighting is automatically switched off if the battery is running out of power. Low energy levels also lead to deactivation of the display, and block the camera and the music player applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Key number 2 did not sustain common SMS writing </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: During the tests the key number 2 fell off the keypad. Even though I managed to put it back into its nest, it would not hold - a problem that could be solved with a small drop of glue. The only excuse in favor of Samsung is that the testing model does not represent the retail version of the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant display means spectacular interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stand-by display of Samsung X700 permits manual modifications. In its top part there is a standard state bar with various icons. Beneath it appears a big digital clock, accompanied by the respective date and day of the week. The operator's logo can be located right beneath the clock, in the very bottom part of the display, or can be fully deactivated. The font color of the logo can be modified too. I was quite intrigued by the option of placing the month view of the calendar right on the stand-by display. Menu is accessed through a press on the left soft key. The right soft key is bound to the phonebook application at all times. You can assign four of your favorite functions to the four ways of the central navigation key. When the phone is on stand-by the central area of the navigation key opens the WAP browser, establishing a data connection immediately afterwards - a solution, which I do not consider very successful. It is inside the main menu where the central part of the control button fulfills its primary function, that is, to confirm user's selections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Main display can be set to permanently view calendar ? setting up the style of operator's logo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700's main menu constitutes of 9 beautifully colored and animated icons. Submenus consist of text only. Menu is searched fast through preset key shortcuts. If you happen to dislike the colors of the menu interface, activate another of the four color combinations pre-installed in the phone. The device responds lightning fast and in no way should it limit your work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Main menu ? in four color versions</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal memory of the phone has a capacity of approximately 30 MB. Other 4 MB have been reserved for Java applications. In case of run out of memory space, the phone is equipped with a microSD (or TransFlash, if you prefer) memory card slot. If you activate the respective item in the main menu, you can access the memory card from any PC by using a standard cable. No special software installation is necessary as Samsung X700 is USB compatible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Memory state indicator ? 4 MB available for Java</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most important items in the main menu is the File Manager. It sorts files into 5 categories - pictures, videos, music, sounds, and others. Unfortunately, these 5 categories only cover the items stored in the phone's memory. Files saved on the memory card are displayed separately. Multimedia files downloaded through Bluetooth are saved directly into phone's memory. If you want them on the memory card, you will need to move them manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: a spectacle of effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel camera. Images are taken with a maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels. The camera lens is not protected, yet it is embedded enough to avoid scratches. The camera application is activated either from the main menu, or by a long press on the respective side button. The display converts into a view-finder in a few moments. Then you are offered two preview options to choose from: to see entire image, but framed by white bars in the top and the bottom of the display, or to make use of the entire display, seeing the central area of the image only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera view-finder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera is controlled intuitively. The main navigation key serves for modifications of the exposure compensation and controls the digital zoom application. Pictures are taken in a horizontal mode. Both the central part of the four-way button and the key on the right side of the device can be used as a release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Camera setup options are quite numerous ? previewing taken photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from 3GP-format video records with sound in a maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels, Samsung X700's camera is also capable of applying various effects. Among them you will find sepia, negative, drawing, relief, or photos composed of four or nine images. Pictures can also be modified by adding various types of frames or could eventually be reversed both vertically and horizontally. Unfortunately, images decorated with a frame are limited to a maximum size of 176 x 144 pixels. All above mentioned effects are applicable onto ready pictures as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample Photos:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of Samsung X700's camera is average. The images it makes mostly suffer of pronounced chromatic aberration. The camera makes best photos when objects are situated at medium distance. Macro mode is pretty poor, with scanned text being practically illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoom is available on taken pictures when they are viewed in the phone. A fullscreen view mode is not available, though. Images are automatically saved in the phone memory. If you want them on the memory card, you will have to move them manually. Images can also be easily sent to another device via Bluetooth or to a printer through a standard cable, due to the compatibility of Samsung X700 with the PictBridge standard. If you are a fan of self-portraits, make use of the tiny mirror located just above the camera lens. And this is the right time and place to regret the lack of additional LED or at least a night mode in Samsung X700. What a pity, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Effects:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls: we want ringing profiles!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is huge. It fits in up to a thousand of contacts, each of which can be assigned a first and a last name, 5 phone numbers, an email address and a note. Additionally, each of the ten groups of contacts available in the phonebook can be assigned a ringing melody, a picture, or a name. Unfortunately, Samsung X700 does not permit to use consolidated groups as filters for incoming calls. Contacts from the phone memory and the SIM card are displayed simultaneously. The phonebook search is performed through letter-by-letter typing of name initials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Contact detail ? new entry and editing options ? phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Each contact can be assigned a picture and a melody ? call records</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During calls the sound coming out the speaker is with quite good quality and is loud enough. A speakerphone is available, too. Samsung X700 plays 64-voice polyphonic melodies or MP3 files, stored in its memory. As to sounds stored on the memory card, I simply did not manage to set them as a ringing melody no matter how hard I tried. Ringing sounds are of very good quality, mainly due to the top-class performance of the phone's stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Samsung X700 rings with polyphonic melodies, MP3 files and voice records</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, Samsung doesn't seem to have learned much from its previous mistakes as Samsung X700 is another of their models lacking ringing profiles. Instead, the phone features a simple quiet mode, which gets activated after a press-hold on the hash button. Due to the absence of ringing profiles, Samsung X700 is not able to ring and vibrate simultaneously. Samsung X700 is a tri-band device able to make and receive calls in GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Display outlook options when a phone number is entered</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages: cannot attach full size photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 works with SMS, MMS, and emails. It displays 8 lines at once for SMS writing. The helpful T9 dictionary available in the phone features no diacritics. Samsung X700 responds to user's commands immediately. If you ever face difficulties in your work, it will probably be the somewhat uncomfortable keypad to blame. Messages can be enriched by inserting a black &amp; white image, an animation, or a melody, all this thanks to EMS support. You can also add an event from the calendar. Messages can be sent to up to 20 recipients at a time. Regarding number search in the phonebook or in the record of last called contacts, Samsung X700 requires pressing far too many keys for my flavour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message menu ? writing SMS ? SMS editor menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone alerts you about received messages by one of 10 pre-installed sounds. Creating a sound of one's own is not permitted. If you do not read the received message, the alerting sound may be setup to repeat itself in another minute or two. Another interesting function is the opportunity to block messages received from up to 10 different phone numbers. Samsung X700 can store up to 200 SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changing font settings in EMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor offers four attachment options - sound, text, image and video. Ready messages can be previewed before being actually sent. MMS use shared memory, with their size being limited to 300 KB. In addition, the phone offers the option of selecting up to 10 phone numbers, from which multimedia messages will be blocked and not accepted in the message box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 is also equipped with an email browser able to manage 5 email accounts. New email messages are controlled either manually or automatically in preset time intervals. You can also select whether entire messages or only message headings should be downloaded. Samsung X700 both sends and receives attachments. Keep in mind, however, that their size is limited: 300 KB in downloads and 200 KB in sent messages. That is why the 1.3 megapixel images are practically impossible to be sent via email - a limitation I consider unnecessary, btw. Available memory space is more than enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Time organized almost perfectly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 organizes time through the following applications: calendar, task manager, alarm clocks, voice recorder, calculator, currency and unit converter, stopwatch, minute counter, and world time application. Text notes are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Month, week and day view of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar is very good and detailed. The calendar offers month, week, and day views. You can insert anniversary dates, tasks, and events, each of which can be assigned a subject, description, place, start and end time, advanced reminder, as well as daily, weekly or monthly repetition until the very date of the event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four event types available ? World time application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task organizer is part of the calendar, but its task record can also be displayed separately, if necessary. The option of marking-off accomplished events is available, of course. The calendar capacity is shared, serving all types of records. It fits in 400 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Samsung X700 has 3 repeatable alarm clocks ? converter converts almost everything</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 has three alarm clocks: two regular ones and one specialized in early-morning wake-up alarms (it postpones alarm by 5 minutes). All three alarm clocks use all types of melodies and MP3 files and get activated even when the phone is off. The phone also features a voice recorder, which makes records up to one hour and those records can be applied as ringing melodies. The calculator is well elaborated, with clear preferences for mathematical operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Voice recorder v time countdown ? stopwatch ? calculator</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You will not get bored<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main entertaining allure in Samsung X700 is its MP3 player. Yet, to my opinion, Samsung could have been more particular about it as it is way too simplified. For example, it does not get minimized (unlike the radio application built in the phone, which does play in background). The lack of equalizer or other sound-modifying functions is regrettable, too. In result, the main advantage of the MP3 player remains the pair of top-quality speakers and the ability of full stereo transmission through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;MP3 player available in two visual modes ? file list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 player offers 'random play' and 'repeat' of one or all music files. However, it does not search files automatically. You will have to add new songs to the playlist manually. The MP3 player only disposes of one playlist. When music is played, one of the two visualizations available in the device appears on the display, occupying approximately half of its surface. Unfortunately, these visualizations are functional with MP3 files only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Player menu and setup options ? music file detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 is delivered together with a pair of black earphones, the so called "plugs". Even though they do not fascinate with exceptional performance, they are enough for occasional listening to music. Earphones could also be successfully used as a Handsfree set, which is performed by the use of the microphone and the green button for accepting phone calls. Connecting one's own pair of earphones to Samsung X700 is impossible, as the phone lacks a standard 3.5mm jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Earphones enclosed in the phone box are pretty good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case that you get tired of playing MP3 all over again, try listening to the radio - the broadcast can also be played through the loud speakers. The radio application can be minimized, but make sure that the earphones are plugged in, as they play the role of antenna. The phone offers enough space for storing of up to 30 radio stations, which can be searched and saved automatically. If you want them renamed, you will have to do it manually. To my opinion, the reception of Samsung X700's radio in city conditions is fully sufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Record of all saved radio stations ? radio menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 has three pre-installed Java games: a classic jump &amp; run game, a football free kicks game, and an air-fighter game. Additional games can be easily downloaded due to the support of Java 2.0. Bare in mind, however, that Samsung X700 is not able to open Java files received through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samples of pre-installed Java games</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>EDGE back-up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers are possible by EGDE Class 10. If you find yourself in a place with no EDGE coverage, try the slower GPRS of the same class. Bluetooth is quite handy for short-distance connections. Samsung X700 does not have an infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>EDGE technology is mostly used for WAP connection. The WAP browser built-in Samsung X700 is started either from the main menu, or by a press on the central part of the navigation key. In the second case, the phone immediately begins to open the preset home page. There is an option inside the browser menu for a direct switch to any primarily entered web address or selection of one of the 15 tabs available. Of course, you can also use X700 as a modem, connecting it to PC through a data cable or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; WAP browser ? inserting a web address</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All contacts and records in the calendar can be seamlessly synchronized with Outlook thanks to a program called Samsung PC Studio 3. The same program also backs up internet connection established through the phone and facilitates MMS and SMS sending. For more details on this software I recommend you to take a closer look at the Samsung D800 review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Success is possible<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 is a good phone with top-class features. Attractive, yet conservative design; large, top-quality display; EDGE Class 10; the megapixel camera and the microSD memory card slot are some of its strongest advantages. On the other hand, it is evident that certain details have not been considered as they should have been: X700 lacks ringing profiles; its MP3 player is much too simple; the camera lacks flash, etc. And last, but not the least, the keypad is rather difficult to use and may cause hard times to beginners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X700 has joined the market group of phones like Nokia 6230i, Siemens S75, and Siemens CX75, so its success depend most of all on its street price.</paragraph>
