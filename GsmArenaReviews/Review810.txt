			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phones like the Gionee Elife S5.5 have come a long way. Well, they're coming from China but this is not stating the obvious as a figure of speech. We've seen good-looking phones made in China that are not the iPhone. We've seen reasonably-powered too. We've seen imitation evolve into real innovation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Gionee is trying to do what Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi have been good at for a while. That's quite an example to follow but how do you stand out from this kind of crowd? Even relative newcomers Gionee know all they need is an eye-catcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touted as the slimmest smartphone in the world, the Gionee Elife S5.5 is seriously good-looking too. Two Gorilla Glass 3 layers either side of a magnesium alloy frame is a combo we'd opt for in a heartbeat. The gorgeous super slim shell packs a beautiful 5" 1080p Super AMOLED screen, with an octa-core chipset ticking inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee had a good look at Android Jelly Bean and went for a complete overhaul of the UI. It doesn't look bad at all, and it certainly behaves - but we've yet to give it a proper try. Just like Huawei and Oppo, Gionee aimed for simplicity, but tried to give users some extra features on top of core functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of 4G is not a huge letdown yet - at least not on the target markets, of which India claims a sizeable chunk. We would guess that it's things like the non-expandable storage and the sealed battery that would be the deal breakers for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heavily customized Amigo OS is based on Jelly Bean and there's nothing certain at this point about an upgrade to KitKat. The more recent, better-optimized OS version would've been easier on the octa-core MediaTek chipset. That by the way, is the same chipset ticking inside the Alcatel Idol X+, which we found to be a reasonable performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we move on and start exploring the Gionee Elife S5.5, a side note is due. A bit unusual perhaps, especially for a flagship, it's not just the Elife 5.5 we're reviewing. The exact same package is available as the Allview X2 Soul and the Blu Vivo IV. Well, Gionee must be keen on making the device widely available even if that makes them a white label manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us after the break, where the world's slimmest smartphone gets through our traditional routine of unboxing and hardware checkup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Gionee Elife S5.5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 comes in a lofty cardboard box packing a bigger than usual set of accessories. Our unit came wrapped in a gold flip case that doubles as a stand. The downside is the flip case gets attached using a strip of double-sided adhesive so it's not something that you would be putting on and off your phone that frequently. Also, the case will make your Gionee Elife S5.5 thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box contains a pretty much mandatory charger and a USB cable. You will also find an in-ear headset, a SIM ejection tool, a microUSB to USB adapter enabling USB OTG and USB Host, and four screen protectors - two for each glass-covered side of the Elife S5.5. The protectors even come with microfiber cloths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some research revealed the Gionee Elife S5.5's set of accessories varies across markets. There is a different, even bigger retail box, which omits the flip cover, but contains a transparent rubber bumper and extra charger plugs instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gionee Elife S5.5 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elife S5.5 stands at 145.1 x 70.2 x 5.5mm and weighs just 129g - incredibly light and thin for a 5" flagship, but seemingly taller for this screen size. The phone is built around a magnesium alloy frame with Gorilla Glass on both the front and rear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 is one of the best looking phones we've handled in quite a while. The dual-glass design was pioneered by the iconic iPhone 4 and the Xperia Z lineup is another prime example. The Elife S5.5 is by no mean worse at that, even next to such dignitaries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sheets of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 cover the entire front and rear of the Gionee Elife S5.5. They are pressure-resistant but can eventually get scratched with prolonged use. That's why Gionee is supplying protectors in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elife S5.5's frame is molded out of magnesium alloy, light and strong. The strong metallic frame and the thin Super AMOLED panel have helped Gionee claim the world's slimmest smartphone title for their Elife 5.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bold angular shape and the flat sides are the perfect match for a body this slim. Good thing the Gionee Elife S5.5 didn't try too hard to mirror the iPhone with its rounded corners. We feared a glass-covered device - and super slim at that - would be nearly impossible to hold securely. Of course, there are phones offering a better grip but the Elife is no worse than an Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unibody has ruled out a removable battery, but it was probably their only choice aiming for a profile this slim. With a 5.0" screen, the Gionee Elife S5.5 is by no means a small device but the ultra-slim unibody feels refined and solid, yet surprisingly light. All bits fit perfectly together in a nearly seamless design and there are no cheap-looking accents whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 feels amazing in the hand, especially considering its size. The white glass-clad back is nice but slippery - the extra slim body helps single-handed use in portrait but, regardless of the ample space above and below the screen, the landscape hold isn't as secure and comfortable. You risk covering the single rear loudspeaker too. Overall though, we think the handling issues are easy to live with in a phone which looks that good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 has a 5" Super AMOLED screen of 1080p resolution and 441ppi. It uses the same panel as the Galaxy S4 - at least in terms of visual qualities. It's bright, with even backlighting, low reflectivity and great contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another underlying similarity is the PenTile matrix with a diamond arrangement. The diamond layout will make sure there are no visible artifacts and, with pixel density north of 400ppi, you can't take away points for sharpness either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee Elife S5.5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 screens up close</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color rendering is great with punchy colors typical of AMOLED screens. There are no dedicated color saturation modes though as on the Galaxy flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since it's a Super AMOLED display, the stellar contrast should hardly surprise. The sunlight legibility is great too helped by the non-reflective screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the Gionee Elife S5.5's 5" Super AMOLED screen, there is an ambient light sensor, a proximity sensor and a wide-angle 5MP front-facing camera - placed either side of the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar control deck of three capacitive keys is below the display. Unfortunately, when the backlighting is off, the keys are virtually invisible. There's no option either to set the backlight to always on. A little inconvenience, although it shouldn't be a big deal to memorize the control layout: it's Apps, Home, Back left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the hardware controls, they are all on the left side of the phone - you get a Power/Lock key and a volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM compartment is the only thing on the left and you'll need a pin to eject it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is alone at the top of the phone. The port supports USB On-the-go and USB Host, which means you will be able to connect various accessories such as keyboards and mice, as well as USB memory sticks. Gionee even provides a proper USB OTG adapter in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 3.5mm audio jack and the mic pinhole are at the bottom of the Gionee Elife S5.5. If you ask us, usability-wise the swapped location of the audio jack and the USB port isn't the best decision but this may've been Gionee's only option in a body this slim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13 megapixel camera lens, the single LED flash and the secondary microphone are placed in the top left corner of the phone's back. Their surrounding plate is part of the magnesium frame instead of the rear glass and is slightly bulging (less than 2mm). The loudspeaker grille is carved out of the rear Gorilla Glass 3, near the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 features a 2,300mAh battery with official endurance of 11h on 3G talk time and 490h on stand-by mode. We've managed to confirm the talk-time rating, but the stand-by didn't turn out that great. The Gionee Elife S5.5 showed disappointing performance on our dedicated video playback and web browser tests too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 had average or below average performance on our battery tests thus scoring a final endurance rating of 48 hours. This means the Elife S5.5 will last exactly two days if you do an hour of calls, an hour of video watching and an hour of web browsing each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Gionee Elife S5.5 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 supports quad-band GSM and tri-band 3G with up to 42Mbps of download speed. There is no LTE connectivity, nor is there a dual-SIM version of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC isn't available on the Gionee Elife S5.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory via a USB connection. The microUSB 2.0 port can also be used in USB On-the-go mode for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or real USB hard drives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface powered by Amigo OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gionee Elife S5.5 runs on the proprietary Amigo OS 2.0, which is another name for Gionee's own heavily skinned version of Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. The Gionee's launcher customizations run very deep, they keep all Google apps and services, and even bring quite a few of its own - themes support, new lockscreen, homescreen, and settings menu among others. The result is a very simple interface with no app drawer (think iOS style).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick Amigo OS 2.0 rundown on video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen has two non-customizable panes - the first one shows the time an upward swipe unlocks the screen. The second pane has a widget with four shortcuts - camera, voice recorder, torch and fake call. The widget has a viewfinder you can use for quick snaps. If you tap on the REC shortcut your Elife S5.5 starts recording immediately, the Torch icon turns on/off the LED flash, while the Fake Call will initiate a fake call in 15s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts (expandable to five), which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens. Each homescreen pane has an always visible weather widget at the top plus it can have up to 12 app shortcuts in 3x4 grid. Other widgets aren't supported, nor is there an app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have up to nine homescreen panes at most. In the absence of an app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper and system icons. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two tabs - the first one holds all notifications, while the second is a 4x4 grid of toggles. You can add, remove and rearrange toggles. A two-finger swipe will take you straight to the Settings page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted app. You can bring it up any time with a double tap on the Home button or with an upward swipe from the Home key. The UI is iOS-like with only three app cards visible at a time. The docked shortcuts and the weather widget are visible in the task switcher too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a dedicated app called Phone Accelerate. You can find all of your background apps there and kill them. You can also potentially shorten your boot times by disabling some unnecessary apps which start with the phone. Finally, you can clean the system cache for each app via the dedicated menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also get full control of your apps via the App Manager app. You can uninstall apps from here, move them to and from the system partition, control their permissions or change the default apps for important actions (SMS, emails, office docs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee has also provided an excellent power management app. You can fully customize the behavior of the Power Saving Mode and Night Power Saving Mode and its activation condition. You can track you battery usage as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't like the dedicated capacitive keys below the screen (like us who frown at their invisibility when not backlit), you can enable the so-called Suspend Button. It is a movable dot that transforms into a placeholder for the Lock, Menu, Home and Back keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Gionee Elife S5.5 offers Guest mode, which can be enabled/disabled either from its dedicated toggle in the Quick Settings page or the Security settings. It hides you call log, messages, photos and disables the homescreen editing options. Unfortunately it isn't password protected.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 runs on a MediaTek MT6592 chipset with eight Cortex-A7 cores clocked at 1.7GHz each. Graphics are powered by an aging Mali-450MP4 GPU, and there is 2GB worth of RAM on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 are benchmarks, which put to the test the hardware combo inside the smartphone. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a truly compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance, etc. The Elife S5.5 was able to post respectable scores next to other top flagships, but the less capable GPU takes its toll on the AnTuTu test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single-core, multi-core, and math performance, among others. We focus on the overall and CPU scores. The CPU scores are quite decent and prove the eight Cortex-A7 cores do a similar job to a quad-core Krait 400 processor. But the underperforming GPU and the lower memory bandwidth add for a significantly lower overall system rating.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex. The 3.0 Manhattan test isn't available on the Gionee Elife S5.5 as its OS is based on Android 4.2, which lacks the proper OpenGL drives, courtesy of Android 4.3 and above. Just as we thought, the old generation Mali-450MP4 GPU is far less capable than the current Adreno crop and it posted very poor scores on both offscreen and onscreen tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2.1 puts to test the HTML 5 performance of the phone, while the Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The third-party UC Browser found on the Gionee Elife S5.5 scored extremely poor in both tests. It is slow, performance bottlenecks occur often and crashes aren't that rare either. We installed Google Chrome instead and it did well on Kraken, but failed to finish BrowserMark 2.1. Still we suggest trying Chrome instead of the default UC Browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 isn't quite able to stand up to the current flagship crop mostly because of its older generation GPU and the unimpressive web browser performance. It will do OK on popular games no matter the GPU benchmark scores, but it definitely needs some tweaking in the web department.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contact management and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface - it offers groups, then there's the contact list and favorites. The UI is pretty standard Android affair, save for the custom paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a three-tabbed list. The middle tab with the contact's details is the default one. Swiping left will take you to the call log with this contact, while swiping right opens the SMS log. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry. You can even block a contact from calling and texting you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing, but it looks up numbers only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Native video calls are available, you can configure them via the Call Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Minute reminder - the phone can vibrate at the 50s of every minute. Other options include shake to answer, volume up key for answer, noise reduction, flip to mute call. You can also build a list of texts to send when you decline a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 scored a Good mark on our loudspeaker test. This means you shouldn't miss any call ringing or notifications with this one. We chose to enable the loudspeaker booster from the equalizer settings in the music player. The difference in the Man Speaking and Noise tests is insignificant, but it increased the loudness on the Nostalgia ringtone by 5dB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized into threads, with New Message and Search keys at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts is also included and supports SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee Elife S5.5 offers great Swype-enabled keyboard courtesy of TouchPal. It has quite-identical features with the recently paid-gone-free SwiftKey keyboard. It has big keys, the swype-input works great, you can choose between different layouts, themes are supported too. It can even predict the words as you type and they popup above the keys, just like on the BlackBerry OS 10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A custom gallery app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 comes with a custom Gallery app. It defaults to a pre-defined folder view of Albums, Wallpapers, Screenshots, Videos and Others. You can't change this view, nor can you customize the default folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it or get a menu with more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights or even create a tiny "planet photo".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oppo-like music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5's player is very similar to the Oppo's latest music app. It has a simplistic interface and is very easy to use and navigate. It also supports customizable DTS audio customizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DTS audio enhancements apply on all music-related apps and games no matter if you are using headphones or the loudspeaker. There are a few DTS presets you can use, but you can also customize one preset by yourself. Loudspeaker booster is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a local list of all music, favorites, artists, albums and folders. There isn't an option to add a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing is pretty much a standard affair. One interesting feature you get is the Sleep Timer. There is also a DTS on/off switch for easy control over the equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on, the notification area lets you control the playback via an expandable notification. There are music controls on the lockscreen, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 also features an FM Radio aboard, but there is no RDS support or at least our unit didn't come with such. The app offers stereo FM recording in the odd ogg format and the recorded files can be accessed via the Sound Recorder app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the Gallery, there is a separate Video app that lists all of your videos. The video player does play 1080p files but only as long as those are XviD or DivX AVI files or MP4 and MKV's. However DTS and AC3 audio tracks are not supported, which makes the MKV compatibility rather questionable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no advanced options and no subtitle support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 faced some issues with our audio quality test which prevented us from completing its evaluation. It does appear that it's a problem limited to our unit or at least its very early batch, but even so we can't do our traditional audio quality chapter here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP autofocus camera does OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 camera uses a 13MP camera that shoots with a maximum resolution of 4208 x 3120 pixels. There is also a LED flash to help you with some low-light photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is pretty much standard - you get three shortcuts on the left (settings, front camera switch, flash) and three controls on the right (switch to video, camera shutter, gallery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu can be accessed either via its dedicated shortcut or with a swipe from the top of the screen. The default view has a feature-rich, yet awkward layout. It is only has a portrait orientation, which makes it even more confusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The topmost buttons set up geo-tagging, the shutter sound, face detection and the level meter. Resembling some real world DJ controls, the next toggle sliders allow you to adjust the resolution, white balance, exposure compensation and ISO. Next up you can set up the capture mode (Normal, Touch shot, V-sign shot, Smile shot) or set-up a self-timer interval. At the bottom there's the final rotary dial, which, much like a digicam's, sets the shooting mode (Auto, Sport, Night, HDR, or Panorama).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, you can easily switch to a normal looking UI, but some of the manual settings are not available on this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee has included some nifty camera features in the Elife S5.5 via the Charm Camera app. It supports Beauty Face, Make up shot, Best Face, Eraser, Life filters, Stamps. It could have been better of all those modes were included in the standard camera app though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 camera samples have an average level of resolved detail when viewed at 1:1 magnification - the noise reduction algorithm has taken its toll on the fine detail. The exposure, contrast and colors are good, which makes for nice looking photos when you view them fitted on a FullHD monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 13MP shots we've snapped:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also snapped two nice sunset samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without going to extremes, though the resolved detail is a bit lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a test HDR shot:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360-degree panoramas on the Elife S5.5 turn out pretty nice but you have to pan around really slowly for the stitching to be successful and leave no artifacts. You can snap pano shots in both landscape and portrait modes, but the latter comes with higher field view and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here is a 5MP shot snapped with the wide-angle front-facing camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We uploaded full resolution 13MP samples to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones. The image quality - resolved detail, noise, colors and contrast - are great, which means the closer you shoot the better quality you'll get.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 24fps. The camcorder UI is similar with the still camera's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elife S5.5's 1080p samples are actually quite ok. There is plenty of detail and the framerate is smooth. Colors and contrast are good as well. On the negative side, they are stored in a 3GP file container and the bitrate is as low as 14Mbps. The auto focus tends to hunt quite a bit with all those moving cars but we've seen worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 captures poor 1080p videos. It manages to resolve very good detail in good light conditions, but fails to do so in the low light. There are visible artefacts on the moving objects and the low frame rate isn't helping either. But the oscillation still remains the biggest of the problems. You can hit the Play buttons on each test and check the video samples for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UC Browser comes pre-installed, you should download Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 comes with the third-party UC Browser pre-installed. It is as fast as Google Chrome, supports themes, night mode, full screen, reading mode, stand-alone brightness setting, and data usage monitoring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Chrome, the UC Browser allows multiple tabs, incognito included. It can sync tabs between your UC Browsers installed on different devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the UC Browser is feature rich, it is slow. As we saw in our dedicated browser benchmarks it performs really poor. In real life it suffers from the occasional freezes, crashes and general lagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We installed Chrome off the Google Play Store and things got better. Not perfect, because we found few sites still had problems, but still the performance was a lot better and there is the great sync between all of your Chrome browsers too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 comes with Kingsoft Office, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer, too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard sound recorder, flashlight, calculator, calendar, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Elife S5.5 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android comes with another great support tool built right in - the Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices linked to your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced device by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data. You have to enable the remote locking initially via the pre-installed Google Settings app on your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs. There is no easy way to access it, you have to launch it from its app icon on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Here's a list of our key test findings about the Gionee Elife S5.5:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design and build quality are superb</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive keys are not visible unless backlit, which hampers usability</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FullHD SuperAMOLED display is one of the best in the business and a joy to look at</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life is average with video and web browsing being especially power consuming</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benchmark performance is overall OK, but the web browser scores are low</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker loudness is good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player plays all sorts of files, but lacks AC3 and DTS sound decoders, or subtitles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera is doing very good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera is good, but we don't like that it uses the 3GP file format</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 is the very definition of surprise. Made with attention to detail and having an easily marketable feature, its hopes of success can extend beyond the intended markets. Being one of the best looking smartphones would definitely help - and we don't mean among the made in China only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The positive impressions started the minute we opened the retail box. It's an exquisitely made phone, a rare combination of delicate and solid. We would understand any sort of suspicion towards a name that you can't be sure how to spell just listening to it, and there is also the Designed in China tag. But some of you too will probably take their time to enjoy the beautiful piece before finally turning it on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's so much stuff in the box too: screen and rear panel protectors, a USB OTG adapter, a flip case - even if the latter looks a bit dodgy with that piece of adhesive tape. But these are accessories anyway that will otherwise cost you some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you decide you are done being amazed and hit the power key, the 5" 1080p Super AMOLED screen will get you back at it. OK, the punchy AMOLED colors are not everyone's cup of tea, but we do like them. The downside here is you don't have the saturation dials to tone things down as you would on a Samsung smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the Amigo OS 2.0 is easy to navigate and snappy enough. It's a heavily-skinned Android Jelly Bean that behaves reasonably well on the octa-core Cortex-A7. This MediaTek chipset powers the Alcatel Idol X+, another smartphone that we reviewed recently, and it is capable of running all eight cores simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gionee Elife S5.5 looks hot and the level of equipment is more than reasonable for the asking price. Top-tier flagships are out of its reach but, in most cases, it's about or even less than half the price of the top dogs. The thing that raises questions is availability - not that the phone is hard to get, but it's a funny story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elife S5.5 is currently available in select South East Asian markets but hey, if it does well in India with all that competition, Gionee can pat themselves on the back. The Gionee Elife S5.5 is not officially available in Europe, but there you can get the Allview X2 Soul, which is an identical device. It's the exact same phone with different branding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Allview X2 Soul</paragraph>
			<paragraph>American users, who like the Gionee Elife S5.5, have the BLU Vivo IV. Same thing on the inside, just a slightly different skin on the outside. And BLU will likely be the first to get it to run KitKat. They are reportedly already working on the update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BLU Vivo IV</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last season's flagships are readily available regardless of your whereabouts so the likes of the LG G2, Sony Xperia Z1 and Samsung Galaxy S4 will be quite a threat. Still highly popular devices with 1080p displays, Snapdragon 800 chipsets and very capable cameras, they cost about the same as the Gionee Elife S5.5. Neither is as good looking (well, maybe the Xperia Z1) but they all have KitKat and might do better in terms of support and customer service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G2 ? Sony Xperia Z1 ? Samsung I9506 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more than a few fellow Chinese smartphones that are worth a look too. The Alcatel Idol X+ is powered by the same chipset. Meizu's MX3 and the Oppo Find 5 are older but by no means outdated. The Huawei Ascend P7 is a lot more recent and looking quite strong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Alcatel Idol X+ ? Meizu MX3 ? Oppo Find 5 ? Huawei Ascend P7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to Chinese phones, it's mostly an "I am not sure" response you can expect from the vast majority of users in the Western world. A "maybe" at best. We think all of the above should be a relatively easy 'yes'. The Gionee Elife S5.5 included. A handful of Oppos and Huaweis have proved that Chinese smartphone makers are to be taken seriously and Gionee looks like another one to watch out for. With Blu and Allview three may be a crowd, but it's a phone we wouldn't mind seeing more of.</paragraph>
