			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W550 features Walkman music player, plenty of internal storage, good mobile internet options and an interesting construction. However, it lacks memory card slot. Is it to offer something more than the competitors? To find out - read the following review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do you feel like getting yourself a good stylish phone with a MP3 player? And you find Sony Ericsson W800 much too expensive and conservative? Then you may consider Motorola E398 for example... ah...no, I got carried away. In fact, I meant the new Sony Ericsson W550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Official photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W550 has a lot of common with its forerunner, but it has been added some brand new useful functions facilitating the work with internet. The phone has already appeared in the shops and is being offered for a price lower than the one of W800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> No doubt pictures are taken with a horizontal hand-hold</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I will not dare recommend Sony Ericsson W550 to highly conservative users. Its design has been created to provoke and, to tell you the truth, it is quite successful in doing so. However, if you do not want to look much too eccentric, simply replace the orange cover with a white one and you can be sure that no one will notice that your phone hides something interesting. Considered its rich equipment, Sony Ericsson is a truly good mobile phone for all those, who love music and technological innovations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Japan in Europe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W550 yields in many aspects to the typical non-traditional Japanese mobile phone. The trouble is that European customers still tend to accept what is standard in Asia with a certain dose of skepticism. Sony Ericsson's designers have made some serious experiments with W550, which make me forecast that this model's commercial success might be somewhat backpedaled by the general conservativeness of the Europeans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Comparison to Sony Ericsson D750</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the delivery box you will find two covers - an orange and a white one. I myself find the combination of silver body and white cover more attractive than the one with the orange cover. Nevertheless, it is doubtless that the latter is indispensable, for the orange has already become a kind of a label for all Walkman models of Sony Ericsson. The manufacturer has also prepared a dark red cover version, but it is not a part of the delivery package and has to be bought additionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   No spring seems to be helpful when opening this phone - similar to the rotating Sony Ericsson S700 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating construction results into the phone being a bit thicker than other mobile models. The good news is that the thickness of 23 mm is compensated by the lower parameters of the other two dimensions. Unfortunately, the weight is not pleasing, either. The phone is 120 g, which is somewhat heavy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display = quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regarding the display, the differences between the W800 and the W550 models are minor. Both feature the same high qualities; they both are easy-to-read at direct daylight and are able to show 262K colors. I cannot complain even about the backlighting, for I did not see any differences in the intensity between the middle part of the display and its margins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display is brilliant, indeed </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu offers four basic graphic themes to choose from. Within two of the motives the icons start pulsing when selected, in the other two the icons are displayed in the form of a sliding animated menu bar. The overpasses into deeper menu levels are viewed as eye-taking animations. The two menu bar themes are probably quite energy-intensive, because at applying them the phone seems to be relatively slower than usual. The standard menu is fast though. It manages animation without delays. Unfortunately, the animation is not possible to deactivate for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Preinstalled graphic themes </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display surface reflects every single finger print or smudge. In this respect, a stylish clothe for cleaning the display's surface would have certainly been appreciated by the user.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS need to be improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the keypad is hidden behind the rotating top part of the phone, the keys had had to be designed to be situated below the rotating level. In result, they are much too flush, which influences the writing process, making it less comfortable. You will come across a similar problem when using the functional keys mounted on the side parts of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The central point of the keypad backlighting is situated under the middle line </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functional keys are a completely different "pair of shoes". This holds true especially for the four-way control button situated centrally, below the display. It is brilliant indeed. It reacts with exactness and clear clicks without having to be pressed hard. The circle bed where options are confirmed feels as if it has been created for nothing else but the ball of your thumb. The keys that surround it are a little bit tougher to press, which in no way nips in their quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Buttons everywhere<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you may have already noticed, manufactures tend to use the side parts of their new models as useful space for installing various additional elements more and more. The W550 model is no exception to this tendency. A big part of the phone's bottom side, for example, is occupied by the port, through which the mobile is connected to the PC, the charger or the earphones. Above the connector you will find a tiny slot for the microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side part of the W550 model features the second speaker, the infrared port, the release button of the camera as well as a pair of buttons which control the volume, switch music files and zoom when the phone is in camera mode. If you press the volume button when the device is in stand-by mode, info about the phone's state will appear on the display. Among everything else, this information includes details about the active profile, the free memory space available and the battery capacity in percents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main connector and the elements on the phone's right side </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first button on the left side of the phone starts the radio or the Walkman music application. Which one exactly is up to you. The second button on the left side locks and unlocks the keypad. The keypad gets locked, if the button is moved downwards. The same move unlocks it as well. The entire system is extremely easy to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manipulating the phone with both hands (AVI, DivX 5.2, 2.2 MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side level there is a switch on/off button, which also serves the ringing profiles; here you will also find the eyelet for the phone's strip. The two buttons mounted above the display are the specialty of the W550 model. They are used in the camera applications and the mobile games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keys above the display are really unusual </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A step towards comfort<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W550 fits perfectly in hand </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The joint of the phone works well and does not fluctuate. I confess that I felt somewhat uncomfortable at the fact that when once opened leftwards the phone is not possible to close but again rotating leftwards. A clear click confirms that the phone has been closed safely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> It is relatively complicated to close and open the phone with one hand only (AVI, DivX 5.2, 1.9 MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the device is dominated by the lens of the built-in 1.3 megapixel camera and its accessories - like the tiny convex mirror for making self-portraits or the flash LED created to help the camera in unfavorable light conditions. The LED's intensity is so high, that you can easily use it as a pocket lamp. The last element that is to be found on the rear cover of the phone is the loudspeaker (enables listening to music without using earphones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   View at the back side of the phone</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Li-Pol for the Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Music is battery-intensive. Sony Ericsson has installed a Li-Pol (Lithium Polymer) battery of 900 mAh capacity not only in the W550 model, but also in its last two phones W800 and K750. The new model is said to have a battery life of 400 hours, but to me, this statement could be seen as realistic, only provided the phone load is minor. Once you plug in the earphones, you will start running out of energy fast. The battery gets charged in approximately two hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The SIM card fits under the battery </paragraph>
			<paragraph>To insert the SIM card you will need to remove the back cover and extract the battery. The SIM card is to go into the right upper corner, below the Sony Ericsson logo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Is that a digital camera?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Taking picture with Sony Ericsson W550 is an experience similar to the one you have with digital cameras. In order to start the photo application, make sure the phone is closed. The side-part key works as a shutter release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;A mobile phone or a digital camera? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is not protected, so it is constantly prepared to take pictures. Unfortunately, the W550 model does not feature auto focus. On the other hand, the lack of this option results into the photo process being much faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The setup options and the effects on capturing the results in W550 are quite diverse, ranging from basic color modifications like night mode, black&amp;white photos, negative, sepia effect or solarizing, up to the creation of more complicated panoramic pictures, framed photos or continuous mode (an option, which allows you to fast make four consecutive photos). The main drawback of the camera is the lack of macro mode. It is a real pity, though, for Sony Ericsson has already showed a successful implementation in the W800 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to not like a certain part of your pictures, you have the option to modify it by using the simple bitmap editor. The latter offers a standard drawing option as well as several state-of-the-art tools for color and composition modifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highest photo resolution in Sony Ericsson W550 is 1280 × 1024 pixels. The phone also offers other two resolution grades meant to be used when images are sent in emails and MMS: 640 × 480 and 160 × 120 pixels. The phone writes EXIF information for each picture. You can set it to insert the data and the time, when the pictures were taken. The phone works with video records in 3GP format with highest resolution of 176 × 144 pixels. However, the sound of the video records is not possible to deactivate and save this way some memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera's environment </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I was disappointed by the lack of zooming when the highest resolution is on. If you take pictures in 640 × 480 format, you are given a 2x digital zoom, which even extends to 4x, when the resolution is 160 × 120. Zooming is available in video records too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sample pictures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample pictures (the higher noise levels are caused by the low light conditions)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pure Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fact that all models of the Wxxx series are given the nickname Walkman is not incidental. These devices are meant to serve both as a phone and a music player. This is the main reason why every time you switch on the phone, it asks you, whether you would like to use it for making phone calls or for playing music (it is possible to deactivate this step from the setup options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman application is started either from the main menu by selecting the relevant icon, or by pressing the respective button on the left side of the phone. Files are sorted by the details given in the ID3 tags. Yet, entire ID3 tags are not possible to view, which is a certain disadvantage. Additionally, you can sort music files by artist's name or file's name, or save them into playlists. The Walkman application works well with video records too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Just like a real "walkman" </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main control element of the music player is the four-way button. Press the right or the left way to select a music file. Press the button up or down to unfold the complete list of the saved files. To move within a selected file, press and hold the button right or left way. The buttons on the right side of the phone control the volume options or can be used to change the track. The player manages both MP3 and AAC files (the latter format is more compact than MP3).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony is good at it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sound quality of Sony Ericsson W550 is fantastic. There is no doubt that this success is due to the profound experience of Sony Company in developing music devices, and especially MP3 players. The phone generates stereo sound. It even offers an option called Stereo widening, which comes to substitute the three-dimensional sound. To set up the sound according to your will, use the built-in five-band equalizer. Btw, the latter is equipped with a Mega Bass option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Equalizer is simple, but useful </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crucial disadvantage of the new Sony Ericsson model is the shortage of memory space. Even though a music player should be indispensably equipped with a memory card, Sony Ericsson's engineers have decided to leave it out. Instead, they have given the W550 256 MB of internal memory. No matter how understandable such a decision may seem to some of you, I myself find it rather unreasonable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The earphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Sony Ericsson is delivered together with a pair of plug-in earphones with rubber extenders. To connect the earphones to the phone, use the reduction, which is also part of the original package. If you do not consider the standard earphones satisfactory enough, use a jack connector to plug in earphones of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connector features a microphone and a button for accepting calls. You can therefore use the earphones as a handsfree set. When a call is coming in, the music gets interrupted automatically and a ringing melody starts to play in the earphones. Once you have terminated your conversation, the call mode gets deactivated and the music file continues from the very moment it was interrupted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Earphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound performed by the original earphones is brilliant. One has to be an utterly confirmed audiophile not to be satisfied with it. What's more, the rubber extenders reduce significantly the outside noise. In other words, you will be able to enjoy your favorite music, no matter whether you are at a crowdy station or you are sitting comfortably at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, be sure to pay attention to what is happening around you when walking with the earphones plugged into your ears. Walking in potentially dangerous places with this type of earphones in your ears is generally not recommended. The trouble is that the rubber extenders leave you completely deaf for the surrounding environment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To make the information picture of the multimedia options of Sony Ericsson W550 complete, let us say a few words about its radio application. As the radio needs an antenna, you need to connect the earphone adapter before you start the radio. In general, the sound quality obtained through the earphones is not bad at all. Nevertheless, keep in mind that you always depend on the signal. If the signal is not strong enough, the reception of the phone will not help, no matter how good it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Radio's environment ? volume options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio is equipped with the RDS (Radio Data System) application, broadcasted by the radio stations themselves. RDS provides information about the name of the station, the name of the music peace, the performer's name, details about the broadcasting etc. The phone offers 20 free positions for the user to save their favorite radio stations. The list with stations can then be searched either manually or automatically (according to the quality of the broadcasting signal of each station).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have started the radio and connected the antenna, you can also play your music through the speakers built in the phone, i.e. you do not necessary have to use the earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A call with a Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I have no remarks in respect to the call sound quality of the Sony Ericsson W550. What disappointed me to a certain extent were the ringing melodies. If you set a MP3 file featuring elements of drums or singing as a ringtone (MID and AMR formats are also available), the sound trough the speakers is unpleasantly sharp. On one hand, it is the type of sound that is very easy to hear and you will surely not miss it. If the phone is lying on the table in front of you, however, the ringing makes you shiver with displease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the innovations in Sony Ericsson W550 is the extended phonebook. It now offers 1000 contact entries, instead of the former 500. Each entry can be assigned up to 24 fields. Here are some of them: several phone numbers, email addresses, internet addresses, a picture, a ringing melody, a note etc. If you enter a birth date, the phonebook will ask you, whether you would like the alert to be saved directly into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you search the phone, you only see the default phone numbers. To search details within a single entry, first select the entry and then use the arrows to move right and left inside the phonebook. In case of a call or message received from an unknown number, the phone asks you automatically, whether it should be saved into the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phonebook </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Related contacts can be sorted into groups, which then can be sent bulk messages or used as a call filter. Unlike the individual contact entries, however, here you are not allowed to give each group a special ringing melody or a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To search the phonebook, write the initial letters of the last name of the person you look for. The phone displays both the entries saved in the phone and those saved in the SIM card. What is not possible is to view both lists simultaneously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>If only the keypad was a bit better...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson works with SMS, EMS, MMS and emails. Beside them, however, it also ensures communication through instant messages. And that is not everything. It even offers voice messages that are MMS, which contain nothing else but a sound path. Unfortunately, once having created a 5-seconds voice message, I did not manage to send it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   SMS editor </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you write texts, you may want to use predictive help in the form of the famous T9 dictionary. The W550 model backs long SMS, allowing for writing of up to 20 consecutive messages. An interesting extra function is the option to teach the T9 dictionary how to use frequently used expressions, which are then displayed in the writing process with priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single MMS can be up to 100 KB big. It fits pictures and texts as well as a video or a voice record, a business card, an item from the calendar, a graphic theme etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Creating MMS ? writing emails</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All applications of the phone run and react fast. It does not slow down, even if a complicated MMS or a long SMS is being written. The only function that seemed to require a bit more time was the insertion of a bigger attachment into a message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pure standard in the calendar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar application in Sony Ericsson W550 is no different from those in other Sony Ericsson models. It offers a basic month view, from which you can switch to a week view, where detailed information about leisure time activities is displayed. Only one type of event (not repeated) can be saved into the calendar, accompanied by details about the date and the length of the activity as well as the exact alert time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a very well elaborated alarm clock. It rings using a polyphonic melody, a selected music file or the radio broadcast. Alarm can be repeated every day at predefined time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager provides several additional time organizing options. It stores standard types of tasks as well as a call alert. Event alerts at predefined time are a matter of course. There is good news for those forgetful, who hate carrying thousands of reminding papers, for the notebook of Sony Ericsson W550 fits in basically everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizer and its tools </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of the time organizer options is quite long. The phone has a timer, a stopwatch, a calculator and a code memory function. In the menu of the organizer you will even find an item called "light", which activates the additional light diode to be used as a small pocket lamp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extras are worth having<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three games in the phone: Extreme Ai rSnowboarding 3D, Gauntlet and a mobile version of the legendary combat game Worms Forts 3D. All three games are optimized to be played with the phone being held horizontally (landscape mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Preinstalled games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VideoDJ, PhotoDJ and MusicDJ applications, which modify videos, pictures and music respectively directly on the phone's display, and which we already know form former Sony Ericsson models, do not miss either. A smart extra is the remote control option, made possible due to the wireless technology Bluetooth. It enables you to send orders to the computer's MediaPlayer program as to which file to play next, or make the presentation application switch to the next photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Entertainment menu ? remote control options ? sound recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now take a look at two of the Sony Ericsson W550 functions, which are extremely interesting - the brand new internet browser (featured for the first time in a Sony Ericsson phone) and the unsophisticated RSS channels reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main menu ? standard view ? fullscreen view and zoom options </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display fits everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As all current web pages are optimized to be viewed on standard computer screens, software companies has been long working on the developing of various technologies that will allow the tiny display of mobile phones to fit in the content of an entire web page. Up until now, however, we have only chanced upon such technologies in the browsers built in smart phones, which were equipped with OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser installed in Sony Ericsson W550 is one of the first exceptions. It displays pages through the use of a function called  Smart-Fit. Incidentally, this same function is also used by one of the best browsers for Symbian OS phones ever, the famous NetFront. The basic task of the Smart-Fit technology is to modify and setup pages in a way so that they do not have to be scrolled horizontally. The option for fullscreen web view is another important and quite useful feature of the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Using the Smart-Fit technology </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NetFront icons shown before the pictures are downloaded only come to prove that Sony Ericsson has taken over the Smart-Fit technology from nobody else but the developer of NetFront - the Access Company. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is another useful function. Page views can be modified from 50 to 200 % of the original size. The smallest font size is meant to be mainly used for reading longer texts. The maximum view size then allows for viewing pictures in detail. It is necessary to point out that even work with the smallest view is rather good. Their quality is gradually starting to resemble the brilliant views provided by the yet unrivalled Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Comparison to the Opera Mini </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Options for saving bandwidth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you pay per KB, you may want to use the option to disable the graphics and display the webpage content in a text mode. Even though you may run into difficulties in the form of chaotic text setting, caused by the lack of graphics, when you work with certain more sophisticated websites, it is still a negligible tax to pay with respect to the amount of KB you lay aside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text version often happens to abridge web pages of additional formatting and thus make their survey somewhat difficult to read. However, if what you are after is only blocking pictures, animation or sounds, you can manually disable them from the browser settings. Cookies or JavaScript files can be disabled in the same way. Additionally, you can use the setup menu to also delete cookies, saved passwords or pages from the local storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>If memory is not enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When standard web pages containing higher amount of graphics and multimedia elements are downloaded, the browser happens to sometimes report the following error: This page is too big to display. Select another link. No matter the fact that the process of page downloading continues, once the OK button has been pressed, the entire page will simply not get displayed. This is one of the crucial inconveniencies of the browser, aside from some minor drawbacks. Let's hope Sony Ericsson will manage to eliminate it in the near future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the mentioned above, my overall impression of Sony Ericsson W550's browser is quite positive. Unlike the browsers in older Sony Ericsson models, which were used for web pages viewing rather exceptionally, the new model provides the user with truly high-class web tool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>RSS channels with you wherever you go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another piece of news is the News Reader application, which reads RSS channels. News Reader is pretty simple, offering most basic functions only. But as it is a part of the standard equipment of the phone, I consider it worth mentioning. The application manages source adding and deleting as well as source importing and upgrading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Worth mentioning is also the interface between RSS and the built-in internet browser. RSS only downloads the overview of the latest news. To view the details, however, you will need the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   RSS environment ? the page is displayed in the web browser </paragraph>
			<paragraph>News Reader works smoothly with "unsophisticated" channel addresses (for example http://www.mobilmania.cz/system/RSS.xml). But if only does the format of the address deviates from the common standard (for example. http://gadgets.zive.cz/index.php?q=node/feed), you are off luck. The reader will not accept it in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the News Reader application is generally an interesting extra, which comes to prove that Sony Ericsson has started to place more efforts into the field of mobile internet technologies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To my greatest disappointment, one of the most significant drawbacks of all Sony Ericsson models persists on in the new W550. I am talking about the absence of EDGE. I can do nothing but hope that the GPRS Class 10 technology, which is a part of the phone's equipment, will manage to satisfy most of you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-done CD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As most current mobiles, Sony Ericsson W550 is delivered with a great amount of accessories. One of them is the CD-ROM containing applications to help you manage the phone and transfer files. Once you install the PC Suite on your computer and you connect your phone to the PC through an USB port, W550 will appear as an extra drive under the My computer folder. From this moment on you can work with the phone in just the same way as you would do with any another device that supports USB Mass Storage. The phone is able to charge its battery through USB too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As many programs on the disk are identical to the PC Suite for Sony Ericsson K750, I have dared extract their description from the review of the mentioned model:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File Manager: provides access both to the phone's memory and the memory card. The memory card is also accessible directly from any common file manager, which is basically the only available option if the phone is connected through a cable. In a cable connection the File Manager displays the capacity of the inner memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image Editor: an application for work with pictures - it helps create wallpaper on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS Home Studio: designed to help you create a master form for your MMS. The multimedia messages are recorded into the phone and then sent to the addressee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sync Station: a program, which synchronizes data with the computer, i.e. with Microsoft Outlook or the address book in Windows. The first synchronization I started was not only quite slow, but also led to an error in the middle of the process. Synchronizing became much faster as soon as the phone was loaded with data and only information alternations had to be transferred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Networking Wizard: its purpose is to quickly set up data connections. Even if my first impression was that the Wizard was not able to detect the network correctly, in the end everything worked properly. The standard setup managed the connection successfully too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All described programs are being offered as free downloads on Sony Ericsson web site.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Box is somewhat boring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do you remember the luxurious box, in which Sony Ericsson W800 is delivered? Now in the case of Sony Ericsson W550, simply leave your memories behind. What you will bring home is a standard cardboard box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;David a Goliath (W550 and W800i)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Without a memory card the chances are much too limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I dare say that this new phone from Sony Ericsson could have become a real Christmas hit, only if the manufacturer had designed it to support the usage of memory cards. The W550 model combines two gifts in one device - a Walkman and a mobile phone - and all this for the reasonable price of approximately 280 euros. Yet, its winning race will probably be stopped by the lack of memory card slot. The trouble gets even more serious considered the fact that the forerunner Sony Ericsson W800 is being already sold at a price not much higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the mentioned above, Sony Ericsson W550 is an excellent mobile phone with fast reactions and top-quality equipment.</paragraph>
