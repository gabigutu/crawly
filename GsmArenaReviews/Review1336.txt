			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time to lace up the gloves and step inside the ropes again. A new dual-core competitor, the HTC Sensation, is challenging the current crop of flagship droids with its fast new chipset, high-res screen, sharp-eyed camera and that classic HTC charm much of which is owed to the latest iteration of Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already took a lap around our review track with the Sensation but now the usual suspects will line up for a straight forward drag race. There'll be a series of dedicated tests and one simple rule: the first phone across the line wins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a dual-core rematch and this time focus will be more on the new kid, the Sensation, than the rest, which we've already covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different features have different value to people, so we'll have a series of tests: for the screen, the performance, the camera, GPS and battery. Based on those you can pick your own champion. We'll try to pick an overall winner but it's impossible to single out the ultimate best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the metal-rich construction of the HTC Sensation puts it a step ahead of the mostly plastic-made competitors. The qHD resolution is very near the distinguished Retina display, but the screen is a massive 4.3-incher, quite bigger than the iPhone 4?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Sense UI 3.0 is very polished - there's hardly a nook or cranny left without eye-catching graphics and 3D effects. Underneath all that gloss is tons of functionality too, like the phonebook or the awesome new lockscreen. But you'll have to have a look back at the review for a description of those, today it is all about the high-octane performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In today?s match, we'll be using three phones primarily: the HTC Sensation, the Samsung Galaxy S II and the LG Optimus 2X. We?ve also invited several other stars for guest appearances: the iPhone 4 has a cameo in our display test, while the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc features in the still camera comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, we have a lot in front of us and competition is quite tight. You can wave the checkered flag now, we - and the droids too - are ready to go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display test: S-LCD vs. sAMOLED+ vs. IPS LCD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation has a qHD S-LCD screen. The "q" stands for quarter: the 540 x 960 touchscreen has half the pixels of a FullHD display in each direction. As far as the aspect ratio goes, qHD screens are ideal for watching HD content. And qHD hits the sweet spot between too few pixels and too many (720p would be beyond the resolution capability of the human eye on a 4-5-inch screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S-LCD is a boost to the old LCD technology in terms of viewing angles. It also promises better colors and higher contrast than most competing LCD technologies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough about what it promises to do, let's look at what it does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this test, we'll use two of the best screens in the business for comparison. The Retina display on the Apple iPhone 4 is an 3.5" LCD with 640 x 960 pixel resolution, while the SuperAMOLED Plus on the Samsung Galaxy S II is a 4.3" WVGA (480 x 800) screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smaller diagonal and higher res make the Retina display the clear winner in terms of sharpness. The pixel density however is very close to the limits of the human eye, so you don't always see the difference between it and other displays. The viewing angles are great thanks to the IPS technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower resolution and ample size of the SuperAMOLED give it the lowest PPI of the three but, with deep blacks and excellent viewing angles, it's a great screen all things considered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our close-up shots give a good idea of the relative sizes of the pixels for each of the screens. The Sensation has about 35% more pixels than the Galaxy S II for roughly the same screen area (slight difference in aspect ratios means they don't exactly match). The iPhone 4 packs about 7% more pixels than the Sensation, but they cover a noticeably smaller area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Sensation's qHD screen has practically the same number of pixels per inch as a 3.7" WVGA screen. This gives the Sensation enviable sharpness by all modern standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are not perfect though, despite the S-LCD technology. IPS performs much better, with only slight color and contrast shifts when viewed at an angle. The S-LCD on the Sensation on the other hand experiences noticeable loss of contrast along with some color distortion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED screens don?t rely on light polarization, so SuperAMOLED Plus has no viewing-angle related issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the screen on the Sensation has its advantages and its drawbacks. It's down to the two basic characteristics of displays - brightness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation's screen is nearly twice as bright as the screen on the Incredible S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, it's about the same as the iPhone with the backlighting set at 100%. The paler darks however take their toll on contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's exactly the contrast that stands no comparison to the best in business. Competing LCD screens like on the Optimus Black, the Xperia Arc and the iPhone 4 are obviously superior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the HTC Sensation is not bad compared to most LCD units on the market. In some respects though (viewing angles mostly), it's a step behind competing top of the line models. It does offer better resolution than the majority of droids on the market, which should be enough for some to overlook its downsides.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera: 8 million pixels compared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've lined up four 8MP sharpshooters: the HTC Sensation of course, along with the Samsung Galaxy S II, LG Optimus 2X and the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few words first on the interface and the general experience of shooting, before we move on to image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation with its Sense UI 3.0 interface completely reworks the Android camera interface. It's simple, keeping the major settings in the column on the right along with the shutter key, and all the other settings in the Settings page, which slides out and only covers part of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could adjust the ISO or exposure settings if you wish, but the UI is more fun oriented: Effects is among the settings always available on-screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shot-to-shot time is quite short (unlike the Optimus 2X which takes about 2-3 seconds to be ready for another photo). The continuous autofocus cuts down on the time it takes the camera to find the correct focus to almost zero, but it also tends to miss the focus in a few shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II, Optimus 2X and the Xperia Arc take the more traditional approach - press and hold the shutter key (be it virtual or physical) to focus and release/full press to shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is a member of the 8MP gang but the level of resolved detail is not the best of the bunch. While contrast in photos is usually very good, the camera does have a clear tendency to overexpose some areas. Color rendering is okay if you like warm colors (as most users do).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest problem however is the noisy image sensor. The noise reduction algorithm manages to clear it out but unfortunately, most of the fine detail goes with it. We've prepared a few crops to prove our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Look at how each camera has done in these details: the sharpness of the numbers, the fine detail in the grass and asphalt and the lines between the tiles on the building's front (and the "OUTLET" sign).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, here's a batch of camera samples we took during testing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation shows clearer signs of oversharpening than the other two cameraphones, but the Sensation does very well at this synthetic benchmark. This mostly shows the limitation of synthetic benchmarks. Once you get to the third poster the limitations of the Sensation camera become more apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While in the first chart, the black on white lines for measuring the horizontal and vertical resolution are resolved clearly, the similar lines in the second poster (that don?t have as much contrast being black on grey) have been smudged away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Sensation, Samsung Galaxy S II and LG Optimus 2X in our Photo Compare Too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation packs the best camera on an HTC we've seen yet - which is great news since that's a traditionally weak area for the Taiwanese company. And while it's not the best mobile phone camera ever, it certainly made the competition break into a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera: HD shooters on the range<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The three phones record FullHD video, though they all take slightly different approaches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation records 1080p videos @ 30fps in 3GP with 44.1kHz stereo sound. The bitrate is set at 10Mbps. The LG Optimus 2X uses 3GP too, but does 1080p@24fps with mono sound (44.1kHz) with an overall bitrate of 12Mbps. The Samsung Galaxy S II goes for the better MP4 container and does 1080p@30fps at 17Mbps, though the audio is mono (44.1kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By those numbers, the Galaxy S II should have the best video quality and the Sensation should offer the best sound recording quality. And in real-life that?s exactly the result we?re getting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After looking at the videos in detail, the Galaxy S II definitely has the lead in image quality. The higher bitrate allows it to resolve more fine detail than the other two. Surprisingly, the Sensation actually managed to beat the Optimus 2X in places, despite the lower bitrate (which is spread out thinner across more frames per second).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared some crops from video frames that should illustrate the differences. Have a look at areas where postprocessing and compression usually spoil the quality: foliage, text, thin lines and fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation's camcorder is consistent with the still camera's tendency to produce high-contrasty, oversharpened, warm images. You can check out the videos we recorded for our Video quality comparison (hit Play on the tool's page).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, you can hear how much cleaner the sound is on the Sensation compared to the Galaxy S II due to the higher sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II always focuses only after the video has started recording, making the first second or two of captured video blurry. The Optimus 2X, on the other hand, adjusts the exposition in the first second of each clip. The Sensation does something similar - watch how exposition "pulses" as cars pass by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out these samples we've uploaded to YouTube - don't forget to click 1080p and watch them in fullscreen for best viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short untouched video sample from the HTC Sensation 1080p@30fps (8.11) plus a Galaxy S II 1080p@30fps sample (11.4MB) and the Optimus 2X 1080p@24fps (4.1MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also interesting to see the different Field of View (FoV) of each camera. We've prepared a collage of still frames from the three cameras. The Optimus 2X has the widest FoV, while the Galaxy S II is the narrowest (in 1080p mode, at least).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three phones also offer 720p mode. All three record 720p@30fps and the results are much more consistent across the sample. We have YouTube videos for you to check out as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have some crops from 720p video frames as well, which will highlight the differences in how each phone performs in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, the FoV changes once you switch to 720p mode. The Galaxy S II becomes the widest, while the Sensation is the narrowest. We've included the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc here, which is about halfway between the Sensation and the Optimus 2X in terms of FoV.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the synthetic benchmarks for still shots, the HTC Sensation appears to do very well in the Video quality comparison. Still, if you look at the top left and right corners of the Good light images, you'll see the main source of its problems - noise and compression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you watch that test video, you'll see how quickly the Sensation adjusts its exposure after we switch the lights off. The resolution chart video is also very good, though that's entirely static and the video seems to fit the allotted 10Mbps very well - suffering no extra compression as opposed to the real-life action-filled clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This suggests that if HTC were to bump up the video bitrate, the results from the video camera on the Sensation will improve quite a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Sensation, Samsung Galaxy S II and LG Optimus 2X in the Video Compare Tool </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As one of the first FullHD-capable phones from HTC, the Sensation was quite interesting to test. There are some issues that could possibly be fixed with a software update, but even without one you can shoot 1080p home videos with excellent audio in stereo and not regret going for the Sensation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and Flash performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Out of the three dual-core droids we're testing, no two use the same combination of CPU core, graphics accelerator and RAM. This should make performance testing and benchmarking fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG Optimus 2X and the Samsung Galaxy S II use dual Cortex-A9 cores but the 2X has them running at 1GHz, while the S II is clocked at 1.2GHz. The Sensation uses two of the good old Scorpion cores (based on Cortex-A8 but with heavy modifications from Qualcomm) running at 1.2GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics: Adreno 220 for the Sensation, Mali-400MP for the Galaxy S II, and an ULP GeForce for the Optimus 2X. As for RAM, the 2X has 512MB, the Sensation has 768MB and the S II packs a full 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So much for the horsepower, now for the track. We have the CPU-heavy BenchmarkPi and Linpack, the GPU-intensive NenaMark 2, the more general Quadrant and a couple of browser benchmarks - SunSpider (pure JavaScript) and BrowserMark (JavaScript + general browser performance).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the first time we're using NenaMark 2 - it is an OpenGL 2.0 ES test, heavy on the geometry, with high-res texture and a lot of shader effects (bump mapping, etc.). It was really taxing fro the mobile GPUs and kept the phones well under the 60fps mark. That served our purpose as the Samsung Galaxy S II is artificially capped at a framerate of 60fps so lighter benchmarks give false results, plus LCD screens usually refresh at 60fps so faster framerates don?t actually improve anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation limped a little on the single-threaded BenchmarkPi, falling behind the slower clocked Optimus 2X but it made up in the multithreaded Linpack, practically matching the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant crowned the Galaxy S II as the winner by a wide margin, while the Optimus 2X and the Sensation were nearly matched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NenaMark 2 graphics benchmark put the Galaxy S II ahead with the Sensation and Optimus 2X posting almost equal framerates. However, the qHD screen of the Sensation means that its GPU has to push nearly 35% more pixels than the other two. This puts the Sensation in second place, slightly ahead of the GeForce-powered Optimus 2X. Note: results are in FPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the two browser benchmarks, they really show the level of software optimization more than the raw processing power. The Sensation lagged behind in both benchmarks by a pretty wide margin - more than we can account for with the different CPU architectures so we?re not ruling out a bug or a system incompatibility here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, both the S II and the Sensation ran Android 2.3.3, while the 2X was still on the less-optimized 2.2 Froyo. The conclusion to draw from this is that maker customizations can make a big difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash performance is an integral part of the browser performance, regardless of what some might say. There's no Flash benchmark (at least nothing up-to-date with mobile browsers) so we looked at real-life performance: YouTube videos and Flash games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II played YouTube videos up to 1080p and played the Flash games we tried trouble-free. The HTC Sensation comes in second. Its custom Flash player reached 720p (but choked on 1080p) and ran games perfectly too. The LG Optimus 2X however maxed out at 480p videos and, while most games ran without a hitch, we found some that lagged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation can offer some of the best performance around, provided that the apps are properly optimized for dual-core CPUs. Lack of optimization can be a stumbling block however, web browsing being the most noticeable area. On the plus side, the Sensation should have enough juice to play the latest 3D games for some time to come.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They might have powerful processors but at the end of the day they're still phones - and what good will they be if you can't hear them ringing. Which is why we're looking at the loudspeaker performance of the HTC Sensation, Samsung Galaxy S II and the LG Optimus 2X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The test is our usual loudness recording test and it covers more than just ringtone strength - the test also gauges the phone's performance when playing music over the loudspeaker or the strength of a human voice coming to of it (e.g. using hands-free during a call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the table with the Sensation, Galaxy S II and Optimus 2X along with several other phones to give this test context.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can read about how we do the loudspeaker test over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation and the Samsung Galaxy S II both scored Good marks with virtually identical results (overall difference is about a decibel). The LG Optimus 2X however fell behind and scored only a Below Average mark, with nearly 20dB less overall. Subjectively, in day-to-day use the Optimus 2X is rather quiet too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed calls, however, should be rare with the Sensation or the Galaxy S II (unless you work with a jackhammer) but you should keep the Optimus 2X close in noise environments or you might not hear it ringing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's how the contenders compare in terms of audio quality. With no resistance applied to their line-outs the smartphones achieved great scores and there's really very little to separate them. Still the Sensation snatches the crown here from right under the Galaxy S II nose for being a tad louder than it. The Optimus 2X isn't far behind by any means those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones comes into play things look a bit different and each of the three competitors had some kind of output degradation. The Optimus 2X stereo crosstalk increased dramatically, though it's worth nothing that it's the one which retains its perfect frequency response. The Galaxy S II got some extra stereo crosstalk as well (though not quite as much) and it got some frequency response deviation. The Sensation takes a small hit here and there too, but none is quite so significant so it remains a cut above the rest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS - lock time and sensitivity tests<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>GPS receivers are commonplace in Android phones but they are a finicky thing - some work well, others take forever to get a lock. And while some hold onto accurate lock, others jump around quite a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested several things: how fast each phone got a GPS lock (without relying on A-GPS) and how accurate the lock was (along with any variations in accuracy). GPS tests are very sensitive to location and time of day (both of which affect the visibility of GPS satellites in the sky) so we tested all three phones at the same time to give them an even start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three droids got a lock in about a minute, literally seconds apart, so we'll call this test a draw. But once the initial lock was done, things went rather differently for our trio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 2X got hold of between 7 and 9 satellites and used 7 of them most of the time. The reported accuracy settled at 5m and mostly stayed there with the occasional jump to 10m.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation spotted 9 satellites and used them all (more satellites potentially lead to a better lock). Accuracy started at around 8m but quickly reached 3-4m and held steady. Note that this is reported accuracy, but actual accuracy should be proportional to these readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II performed worst in this test, using all of the 6 satellites that it managed to detect. Reported accuracy went between 18m and 20m but varied quite a bit during the test (even though the phone was completely stationary).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS sensitivity was a pleasant surprise. Some people might not want to trade in their dedicated SatNav unit for a mobile phone after reading about this or that phone having GPS issues, but the HTC Sensation sure isn't one of those phones. It will do an excellent job at guiding you - provided you buy a license for HTC Locations or some other SatNav app if you prefer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery tests, web browsing and video playback. We already have a pretty decent library of results, so we can get a good feel of how the HTC Sensation performs battery-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing test was done over Wi-Fi with the screen set at 50% brightness using an automated script. The script is a bit more taxing than manual browsing, but that didn?t stop the iPhone 4 running for nearly 8 hours straight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation on the other hand, managed just less than 4 hours. This isn't far off what other droids have achieved but is still the lowest result we've had so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested video playback too. The Sensation wouldn?t play the video we usually use, so we had to use another with a lower bitrate. Video tests are done in Flight mode to get the maximum run time out of each phone. The Sensation posted a time very similar to that of the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, we're sure you've already picked your favorite, but we'll have a few of our usual parting words anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is a very good phone all round and the tests we ran gave us no reason to doubt it. But it's by no means perfect. The death grip issue is one thing (check our our two tests), but the battery life failed to impress too when it came to web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is good, though there are better, and the screen fails to reach to the top of mobile screen goodness. The performance benchmarks did well to demonstrate the power of the 1.2GHz dual-core chipset, but the browser definitely needs more work. The GPS performance left us with nothing to complain though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few bullet points that cover the impressions each test left us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you still like the Sensation you shouldn't let comparisons get to you. And we're not implying either that one has to be an HTC fan to buy it. We'll say it again, it's a good-looking phone with plenty to like. It's just that there're some excellent alternatives for your hard earned cash. Now, who would say no to that?</paragraph>
