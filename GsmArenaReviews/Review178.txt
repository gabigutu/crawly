			<paragraph>It almost feels unfair of LG to give the KP500 a name that's so hard to say no to. The Cookie scent seems to have inspired a craving already and LG are hoping to have you coming back for more. A genuinely affordable touchscreen, a very decent specs sheet, and fun and friendly interface can turn out quite a treat if baked right. Our light and crunchy review is hot out of the oven, so let's crack the fortune cookie, shall we.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie seems to have every reason to chill out and cash in on the kept promise of making touch-operated phones so sweetly inexpensive. Available for a mere 200 euro (contract-free) it might enjoy a decent run, pretty much owning the lower end of touchscreens at this point. So much so, that it's tempting to speculate whether the Cookie could've been the right kind of response to the first iPhone, with the proper timing of course. OK, this maybe taking it too far but don't go blaming us. It's the Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, LG have seen to it that the jar is full of Cookies of various icing. The KP500 comes in black, brown, silver and gold. Just released and exclusive to Orange, LG KP 501 is the very same Cookie (with minor changes to the exterior) in two new paintjobs: pink and silver (black will also be available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now then, Cookies will pour down on the market in all shapes and flavors, but let?s see what they?re up against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hot (as in heatedly debated) Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is perhaps comparable to the Cookie pricewise. Well, if 80 euro does not sound close enough, the complimentary stuff you get with the Nokia 5800 is well likely to justify the price premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5800 XpressMusic is by no means as user-friendly and fun to use but its spec sheet is almost scary in comparison: GPS receiver, Wi-Fi, smartphone OS and screen resolution are all out of the Cookie reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another alternative among recent touch phones is the HTC Touch Viva, which retails for about 210 euro. The as-basic-as-it-gets WinMo device carries a trimmed-down version of the TouchFLO UI but the not too friendly underlying OS will hardly lure too many potential buyers away from the Cookie. It's only fair to note though that basic in WinMo terms includes Wi-Fi, and that's the ace up Touch Viva's sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Viva</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices we just lined up the closest Cookie's competitors in terms of pricing and touchscreen functionality. But they are smartphones and their targeting is different. A couple of non-OS touch phones by Samsung might also count here but none comes close enough to the Cookie concept.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Samsung F480 and F490 outdo the LG KP500 in terms of data transfer speed and imaging, but are old enough to have lost some appeal. Plus, their price is still not competitive enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that pretty much leaves the Cookie unchallenged in its price bracket. Not a bad way to start really, but it's about time we checked the real deal. The rest of LG KP500 Cookie is this small jump away. You know the drill - exterior and ergonomics coming up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: just about expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The price tag pretty much says it all about the retail package of LG KP500 Cookie. You can of course count on it that the essentials are covered, but the Cookie retail box just won't go any further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The included handsfree is one piece, which means you're s(t)uck with the provided headphones. If you want to change them you will either need a set with the proprietary LG plug or a third-party adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items in the box are a USB data cable and a DC charger. You also get a screen protector, the user manual and a mini CD with the software required for syncing your Cookie with a computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KP500 Cookie 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KP500 Cookie is one of the most compact touchscreens on the market. When talking touch phones, there is only a handful of devices to be as friendly in terms of size. The names that instantly come to mind are HTC Touch Diamond, Samsung F480 Tocco and Samsung Armani.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Cookie will be easily squeezed in any pocket and it won't even bulge, as the handset is the nice 11.9 mm thick. And the first time you hold it in hand you'll be amazed by its weight - the mere 89 grams make it one of the lightest chaps around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Simplicity must have been the first thing on their mind but it sure looks like the LG designers were having fun working on the KP500 Cookie. There's nothing to suggest simplicity was driven by frugality. The neat and cute handset projects a cheerful attitude and manages a lot more style and personality than the price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing fancy and frilly about the rubbery finish at the back but it adds to the solid feel and friendly charm of the phone. It's also quite practical and fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG KP500 Cookie resembles the KC910 Renoir for the three hardware buttons below the screen. Those include a Call and an End key on either side of the Launcher/Multitasking key that brings up a menu of shortcuts to your favorite apps and a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three knobs are smaller than the Renoir's but stylishly framed in chrome and very solid and responsive (and quite better looking we should add). Your thumb simply sticks to the slightly concave knobs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing we like in the Cookie is the slight sloping at the bottom. It gives the phone a distinct face and also improves handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, the keys design is the only thing that differentiates the Orange exclusive LG KP501 from the LG KP500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front panel is taken by the 3" display, above which you'll notice the centrally placed earpiece and LG logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker, the universal connectivity port and the lanyard eyelet are on the left. The connectivity port is covered by a small plastic lid to prevent it from filling up with dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where the shutter key and the lock key are placed. Those are too tiny for our taste and a proper press is really hard at times. Press feedback is poor and the touchscreen lock key especially has a very low stroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also here, hidden under a small plastic lid. The handset had no trouble handling a 16GB microSD card, which is the largest currently available. This means the Cookie won't fail you in terms of storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of LG KP500 Cookie is completely plain while the bottom hosts the mouthpiece and the stylus compartment. Peculiarly enough, the stylus goes in horizontally instead of vertically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the handset is also far from crowded, the 3 megapixel camera lens getting all the attention. There is no flash of any kind to boost low light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 900 mAh battery. In moderate use, it can keep the phone going for about two days, which is not exactly a great achievement. Frankly the quoted 350 hours of standby and 3 hours and 30 min of talk time had us fearing worse, but middling is probably what defines it best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the LG KP500 is better than its price tag. But what's more important, the Cookie has a distinct personality and wide-reaching appeal. Some will go for the neat and simple styling, while others will respond to the cheerful and friendly attitude. And all will appreciate the nice handling and solid feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KP500 Cookie is equipped with a 3" 256K-color resistive touchscreen display of WQVGA resolution. Resistive screens do require more pressure (as opposed to capacitive ones) for a command to be registered. This may sound self explanatory, but one can easily feel and appreciate the difference between the Prada II we just reviewed and the Cookie. The Prada (like the iPhone, which uses the same touchscreen technology) was quick to respond to the lightest touch, which made the Cookie feel a bit clumsy at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the screen of the Cookie is one of the most sensitive we've tried, so after a short while operating the phone became quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen technology is otherwise the only difference between the Prada and the Cookie in the display department. 3" WQVGA screens are to be found in a number of LG touchscreens - from the first Prada, through the Viewty and F700 to the Renoir. Neither the size, nor the resolution is quite the cream of the crops at the high end. But they make perfect sense in the Cookie's price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also quite a number of settings for the touchscreen feedback. You can choose between gentle vibrations (haptic feedback), or a tone when a click is accepted. You can also turn both off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get to pick the type and strength of the vibration plus the type and volume of the tones. Finally, you can calibrate your screen to optimize touch control. There isn't a setting that the LG engineers have missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself offers decent image quality with good brightness and contrast levels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A fresh touch to the user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Cookie has the latest Flash-based touch interface by LG, very similar to what the KC910 Renoir offers. The functionality is slightly cut down here and there to underline the KP500 market position but there are also some improvements such as a second standby screen where you can arrange you favorite contacts (the LG Renoir has only one, while the LG Prada 2 has three of those).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is quite an achievement for the modest Cookie to be able to match (and even outdo at times) the interface and performance of the twice more expensive Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface features a lot of nice animations and transition effects. For example, when you get to the bottom of a scrolling list, the items don't just stop rolling, but bounce and throb to your sweeps with almost physical elasticity as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is generally quick and responsive enough and lagging is rarely an issue. In everyday use it is hardly bothering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nicest novelty that the LG KP500 brings is the two alternating homescreens. The first is the Widget-enabled screen that allows you to arrange several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the second homescreen you sweep your finger sideways across the screen. The screen turns over like you roll a cube (remember the first HTC Touch TouchFLO?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second homescreen doesn't work with widgets, but lets you to arrange contact icons instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's get back to the Widgets home screen. You've probably already read about it in our LG Renoir or LG Prada 2 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widgets tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or hide the ones you don't need back in the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets available on the LG Cookie are the same as the ones on the LG KF900 Prada, which means that there are fewer of them as compared to the LG Renoir. The LG Cookie offers an analog clock, a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a notes app, Image slideshow, a world clock, and a calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets missing from the Renoir are the alternative digital clock and the dedicated weather widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, new widgets cannot be added. That is the main disadvantage compared to the competing Samsung TouchWiz interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to align the widgets onscreen by shaking the handset thanks to the built-in accelerometer. For this to work however you need to have the widgets tray opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video demonstrating the LG Cookie user interface: the widgets, the 3D-like homescreen and the two types of main menu navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Digging further down the menu system<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For those of you that meet the LG Flash interface for the first time, we'll also cover the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen you will find a navigation bar with four nonnegotiable shortcuts. The first one takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contacts list, the third one takes you to Messaging, and the last one brings up the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu system is simple, yet decently organized and generally very usable. The main menu consists of four tabs - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. Changing the tabs is done by clicking the respective icons. Alternatively you can select the scrolling menu option from the settings where you can change tabs by simply sweeping your finger accross the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They the first tab is named Communicate and quite logically is related to making calls and sending messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is entertainment, which houses the multimedia files, the camera, the FM radio, the games, and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Utilities tab comes third, bringing the web browser and applications such as the Calendar, Calculator, Unit converter, etc. It also features a drawing pad where you can create quick sketches using the touchscreen. And, finally, the last tab is reserved for settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the LG KC910 Renoir, the LG Cookie has fixed main menu structure. You cannot rearrange the items and that's a strange decision by LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the LG KP500 Cookie interface auto rotates when you turn the handset to landscape mode. The feature works selectively and is only available when you're typing a message, browsing images or watching a video. Rotation is quick but perhaps not the smoothest we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are glad to see the LG Cookie use the set of colorful icons that's usually reserved for the white-background theme in previous touch phones by LG. This time around, the colorful icons are set upon a black background, which however has a touch of color as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This once again confirms that LG have intended the LG Cookie to be a more lively and fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since the KF700, LG handsets come equipped with a task manager. The Cookie makes no exception with the handy application allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the Cookie is pretty similar to the one found on the Renoir, having a "launcher" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. Unlike the Renoir, the KP500 only offers nine slots since the favorite apps list isn't scrollable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing the Cookie shares with the other recent touch phones by LG is the Status screen - touching on any of the icons on the status row on top (next to the clock) opens up a screen with signal, battery and memory stats, and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, music player and Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is doing fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG KP500 Cookie is up to 1000 contacts, each with its full set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with fourteen fields, but once you enter a number or an email address, an additional field of the same type becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date as a reminder to the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contacts list is fluid and friendly. In fact, LG have done a great job with scrolling throughout the user interface so it's almost as enjoyable as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those starting with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar, which seems the quicker option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as all together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie handles phone calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues.There is Smart Dialing, and Speed dials are supported. When you hit a key, which has been assigned, you get hinted of the contact in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Smart Dial is quite useless as it only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you typed. This just isn't of much use since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they got their names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging's good to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie handles SMS, MMS, and email. Much like most other handsets by LG, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the multi-tap alphanumeric keypad, or you can rotate the Cookie and go for the landscape QWERTY keyboard. There is touch feedback either way, which certainly assists typing accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the QWERTY keyboard is not much of a treat as the 3" widescreen display simply isn't large enough to fit all those buttons. As a result, keys are rather small. Furthermore, the character keys don't make much sense either. There seem to be some pointless buttons like the Plus sign (strangely enough there is no full stop) that just take space. As much as we hate to admit it - stylus seems to be the right way to go here. Well, the rather unusual placement of the stylus compartment doesn't seem so strange now, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it - there is also handwriting recognition (two types of it actually) if that's how you roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG Cookie deals with them hasslefree. Setting up an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically. Furthermore, we were prompted to select between POP and IMAP setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum attachment size for outgoing mail is now 1MB instead of the 300KB in previous models, and the maximum size of incoming mail attachments has also been increased to 1MB. Still, such limitations are a nuisance in a modern email client and we suspect they're imposed to save network carriers the traffic hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and previewed directly via the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for marking multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia performance is surprisingly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was a nice surprise to find the multimedia performance of the Cookie a good match for the KC910 Renoir flagship. Except for the reduced internal memory (50MB, compared to 100MB on the Renoir) you will hardly find any difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with up to 16GB memory cards supported no one will actually care about the miserly 50MB of inbuilt storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when you have a memory card inserted, each time you open the file browser it needs to refresh the image thumbnails. Not much of a problem if you have a small picture gallery, but it could get annoying taking several seconds with a huge number of photos,. But that's a common issue for all current LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another drawback is that no matter what file sorting you opt for (date, type, name), the files on the memory card always get listed first. While that might not be much of a problem to most users it doesn't make much sense, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie file manager includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. However, unlike some previous generation LG handsets (and those include even some pretty expensive ones) it has no problem handling user-created folders and the files in them. Boy, were we relieved to see that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have vastly improved their image gallery with the latest generation of touchscreen phones and now it offers a really nice touch experience. Flipping through images feels so natural and fluid that it is comparable to the best in the class - the Apple iPhone. And with the Cookie photos on board are of slightly higher resolution than 2 megapixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check your photos straight in the file manager or you can start the dedicated gallery where larger thumbnails are available. Still, the viewer for single images is one and the same for both methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse images in portrait or landscape mode just by changing the orientation of the handset. Unfortunately, zooming on an image is a bit slow and works in quite small steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KP500 also features the same image editor as the KC910 Renoir with its wide range of options. First off, you get a creative part that allows finger drawing on images, text typing, clipart watermarking, face morphing, selective colorization, and selective color boosting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have tools for basic image treatment such as rotate, resize and mirror, as well as more advanced photo editing options such as levels, brightness, contrast, color, hue and saturation, sharpness, blur. Red-eye removal is also available. And finally, you can add color effects such as black &amp; white, sepia, negative, glow, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the rich features of the editor, we think it scores low on usability. The different options are inconsistently spread across various menus. Nevertheless, we highly doubt that most users will edit photos on their mobiles anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player comes with equalizers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie has a really nice music player and if you wonder what nice really means, we guess better than the Renoir pretty much says it all. The layout is intact and the looks aren't too different but some nice functionality has been added. In fact you will get the same updated music player in the LG Prada 2, which we just reviewed this week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new stuff is basically the seriously enhanced Album Art visualization and the equalizer presets, which LG touch phones lacked up until now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG Cookie music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. User-created playlists are also an option. Naturally, the music player can run in the background. You can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated mini player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that equalizers are available, you can opt for one of five presets or you can turn it off to enjoy the track's original sound. A rating system has also been added, which allows you to give a score of 1 to 5 stars to each track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie turned out to be quite a skilled musician. In our regular audio quality test it did very well, with frequency response close to perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings vary but are better than most other handsets we have tested. The noise level and dynamic range marks are excellent while the distortion values are quite acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem is the poor stereo crosstalk performance, hinting of mechanical fault.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the table to see how the Cookie compares to some of the handsets we have managed to test. You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when you minimize the FM radio you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is nothing special<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is the one part where the modest Cookie is no match for the Renoir. Due to the lack of DivX and XviD support, videos are less of perk compared to the cameraphone flagship of the house. The YouTube integration is also removed although it isn't as much of a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can run in both portrait and landscape mode, the latter of course the preferred way with the widescreen display. Alternating the two modes is as easy as flipping the phone to its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to take screenshots of a running video and there is also a built-in video editor that can due a number of modifications to the source video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pleasing 3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Given the phone's distinct youth appeal, the LG KP500 Cookie camera surely becomes an important feature. The handset sports a 3 megapixel fixed focus snapper with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It has no flash of any kind, so night photography is not really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the camera lens in the very top corner at the back is somewhat unpractical since your support finger often gets in the way when shooting. And with a handset this slim and a shutter key so small taking a photo with one hand is virtually not an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is almost identical to the one of the LG KC910 Renoir. Even if not the most user friendly we've seen, it is nothing you can't get used to. It offers a moderate amount of user-configurable settings including white balance, effects and quality settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the viewfinder you get to pick whether the frame should appear fullscreen (which involves cropping due to the sensor and the screen having different aspect ratios) or actual size, whereby you get black stripes for the unused screen width on both sides of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir didn't have that option at all thus forcing the fullscreen cropped version upon the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is one of the best parts about the camera. Now, since there is no autofocus we are obviously not talking macros here but the rest of the photos turn out pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images produced by the LG Cookie have more than enough detail and noise levels are easily tolerable. Sometimes the colors are off however they are not too bad so this is not much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only noticeable problem with the image processing routine is the evident oversharpening on most of the photos. This has been an issue with almost all recent LG phones (LG Renoir and LG Secret included).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned the handset captures video in up to QVGA resolution. With enough cameraphones around shooting WVGA@30fps this is hardly a commendable achievement by today's standards. Still, if you only watch your videos on the phone's screen things might not be too bad, and we shouldn't forget the price tag after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file format used here is the 3GP video format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video from LG Cookie's camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been a surprisingly good overall performance so far but we knew all along the inevitable compromises to keep the Cookie's price tag low would eventually shine through. Its connectivity package has none of the high speed wireless data transfer carriers - 3G and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It still packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and the other connectivity options include Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and USB v2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four available USB connection modes on the LG Cookie including Mass Storage, which makes both the internal memory and memory card appear as removable drives on your PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also receive calls when connected in this mode but an incoming call interrupts the connection to the internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie has a generally nice web browser, with good touch response and a moderate amount of features. Zooming and scrolling is fast enough and you can drag pages around with your finger much like you would on an iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse web pages with or without the controls visible. A tap on the screen brings back the controls. Zooming in and out is quite intuitive too - a longer hold on a section of a web page will zoom in so it fits on the screen from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the screen landscape is automatic thanks top the built-in accelerometer and it makes browsing even more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also search web pages for specific text strings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the recent LG touch phones, the web browser history is quite conveniently displayed as a line of webpage screenshots - you can flip through them and just pick the one you want to open again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. You can however go for the streaming mobile version of YouTube at m.youtube.com.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has all the essentials covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KP500 Cookie has a decent set of time-management applications. It's obviously not pitched at business people and its target audience should be quite happy with the features offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, offering monthly, weekly and daily view modes and decently finger-optimized browsing. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default (options are Monday or Sunday). You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding one of the three category events (appointment, anniversary, birthday) is as simple as it gets. The LG KP500 Cookie can store up to 500 calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a separate To-Do application and it also has room for up to 500 tasks. A Memo feature allows storing some notes (up to 100). Another organizing app is the Date Finder, which can instantly tell you what day of the week any given date will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can backup your calendar events and to-do's on the memory card and restore them later on if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 alarm slots available. Each of them can have its own title, trigger time and repeat pattern (snooze time can also be customized), as well as tone and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing applications on the Cookie are calculator, unit converter, stopwatch, world clock and voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KP500 Cookie also offers office document viewing courtesy of the built-in Picsel viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS and PDF files. The phone couldn't handle a PPT file we uploaded for a quick test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling and zooming in documents is very fast and fluid, except on extremely close zoom levels. This seems to be the case with most LG handsets in fact but we don't think it's that important. No one actually needs to zoom in that close. Text searching is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even view your documents in landscape mode. However the viewer doesn't switch to it automatically when you tilt the handset. Instead you have to press the onscreen virtual key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In most cases reading your documents in this mode is much more comfortable and natural. The Cookie doesn't have support for editing documents but let's be honest - no one actually expected it to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Some games add to the fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite in line with its market positioning, the LG KP500 Cookie comes with a bunch of preinstalled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the two accelerometer based titles. While not exactly games they are a nice way to demonstrate the sensitivity and precision of the built-in sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one (Flying Dices) allows you to roll a pair of dices by shaking the handset while the second is a Wheel of fortune (called Wheel Mania). The Flying Dices also offer a set of really simple mini games, including a drinking game. Maybe this is the right handset to get a party off the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we also have the Pipe game where you have to put together different shapes to complete the pipe system and get water running. Thomsons and Touch is a set of six mini touch-controlled games. So generally, from all the recent touch handsets by LG, the Cookie has the biggest selection of games for your leisure time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are free to install other games of your choice without worrying about the unconventional resolution - titles for QVGA screens run just as fine on the Cookie, taking only the upper two thirds of the screen. The unused space is occupied by virtual controls that make up for the lack of a D-pad and context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are programs such as Opera Mini that don't need the virtual controls as they support touch operation, while there are others such as the unofficial Google Talk for Mobile that will accept commands only from the virtual controls at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not exactly scientific but the LG Cookie simply makes sense. Smart and confident, though never self-important, it doesn't seek to impress but is straightforward, credible and convincing. Great handling, attitude and a distinct identity are not guaranteed even in the high end, and that's something the LG KP500 Cookie should be proud of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price tag seems the all too convenient excuse for the middling spec sheet. We'll just go ahead and say the decent feature set could've been near impossible to resist with 3G data speeds. Wi-Fi is probably way beyond reasonable expectation in this price range. The interface may have its quirks here and there but the user experience is compelling enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Easily the most popular LG handset in our database recently, the KP500 Cookie is off to a flying start and looks fit to keep it up for quite a while. And with so little competition in the touchscreen mid-end things look good for LG, who don't need to fear too many hands in the jar.</paragraph>
