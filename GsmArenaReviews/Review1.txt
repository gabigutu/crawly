			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus is one half of the nova pair that debuted at IFA just weeks ago. It's a new generation of an Android smartphone by Huawei, mixing midrange with flagship, premium with everyday, trying to deliver a fresh experience in an increasingly busy market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nova and nova plus handsets take a step back from the P-lineup, but offer the same attention to detail and user experience. These could easily replace the Honor devices, which are sort of stand-alone brand that's not available everywhere where Huawei is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A camera-centric phablet with a pinch of Mate in it is what the Huawei nova plus represents. The regular Huawei nova is slightly more compact, but still a 5-incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus clearly takes after the Mate series and comes with a 5.5" 1080p screen enhanced by a beautiful 2.5D black glass. It's powered by a capable 14nm Snapdragon 625 core with 3GB of RAM, but it's the camera that stands out, a 16MP bright sensor with optical image stabilization and 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you were wondering, the Huawei nova plus is the global version of the Huawei G9 Plus launched rather quietly in China last month. The company has the habit of releasing some of its phones in its home market first under a different name so nothing out of the ordinary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the list of features Huawei packs in each new device is steadily growing, the shortcomings are pretty consistent as well. The lack of a proper screen protection was perhaps a more blatant omission in the flagship Huawei P9 as its screen could easily scratch if you are not careful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that though, there are no major gaps in the spec sheet. On the contrary, the Nova plus is among the first company devices to offer 4K video recording, and it's not even a flagship. There is an FM radio too, which is a rare catch these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see what else the Huawei nova plus has in store for us. We continue on the next page with the usual unboxing and hardware checkup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei nova plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus comes in a big flat black box pointing to the premium nature of its inhabitant. The nova plus comes accompanied by a 2A charger plus, a USB Type-C cable, and a pair of EarPods-inspired headphones with a mic and remote. These are all packed in separate black paper boxes inside the big one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the smaller Huawei nova we also got for a review is sharing lots of DNA with the P9, it seems the nova plus is more akin to the Mate lineup. Opting for a bigger screen and a high-end camera resulted in a bigger footprint and a small hump at the rear to accommodate the optics, but overall Huawei did a good job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're after a good-looking phablet, the Mate series have long earned Huawei a spot on the shortlist and the nova plus doesn't disappoint either. It is mostly made of airplane grade aluminum which is very lightweight yet durable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two tiny plastic strips around the back for the antennas, but that's pretty common. And Huawei is proud with the nova plus antenna setup, which reportedly features gold-plating for enhanced performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beautiful 2.5D glass on the front covering the 5.5" IPS screen serves the phablet right, while the almost flat back is great to the touch thanks to the nice matte finish. Finally, the frame that goes all around the sides is tastefully done in silver, looking sturdy and allowing a reasonable grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint scanner on the back of the nova plus is, and we know we are repeating ourselves, one of the best solutions in the market: always-on, blazing-fast, and with great sensitivity. It's the opposite of tiny, and Huawei has its ways to use it beyond its primary function. Its frame goes well with the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera hump is really nothing to worry about as it doesn't make the phone wobble. We are not fond of its patterned texture, but that's a personal thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the nova plus feels and handles like a Huawei flagship. Even though it's not targeting the high end, Huawei did its very best to deliver a great phablet with strong grip and excellent build quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.5" display is the earpiece with a subtle metal accent. The 8MP selfie camera and a couple of sensors are on the side. There is also a tiny status LED hidden close to the earpiece that flashes notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing below the screen but the Huawei logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hybrid SIM/memory slot is on the left which can either take two nano-SIM cards or you can swap one of those for a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and the power/lock key are on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the nova plus houses the audio jack and the secondary mic. The USB-Type C port is at the bottom, in between a couple of grilles, one for the primary mic and another one for the speaker. We guess the big microphone grille is there for symmetry and we appreciate the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 16MP optically stabilized camera is humping at the back, complemented by a dual-tone flash. The always-on fingerprint sensor enjoys the space below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus has a very promising 5.5" IPS display. Arguably, 1080p is a bit outdated, but the 401ppi is more than enough for a mid-ranger and achieving an excellent mark in pixel density. The 2.5D screen glass looks nice, but we'd have really appreciated an adequate glass protection to keep the scratches away from the display. Once again, there is no protective glass mentioned anywhere in the Huawei's promo materials and official specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei promises 450 nits of maximum brightness. The 400 nits max brightness we measured is close enough to their claim. The minimum brightness is great though at 3.5nits and should be quite comfortable for reading in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the deep blacks the contrast is excellent at 1281:1, and it's even better than the P9 and Honor 8's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding color reproduction accuracy, the Huawei nova plus screen is an average performer. It came out less than stellar with an average deviation (DeltaE) of 6.2 - a bit higher than what we would ideally like. Fortunately, opting for the warm colors calibration option fixes all colors that were off and achieves a stellar average deviation (DeltaE) of 3.8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus did an uninspiring job in our sunlight legibility test. A score of 2.239 means you'll barely see what's happening on the display in bright sunlight.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus is powered by a hefty 3,340mAh battery. The battery is non-removable but combined with the 14nm midrange Snapdragon processor we expect it to go a long way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our battery test and the Huawei nova plus scored a 79h rating, which means you can count on the battery to last north of 3 full days on a single charge if you do an hour each of calling, browsing the web and video playback a day. The phone posted consistently good scores on all tests, including standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly the dual-SIM standby turned out very close to the single-SIM one and thus it didn't affect the overall endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standby battery life was gauged in the Performance mode, which does not put any limits on the hardware. The Standard mode will add a couple of hours to the rating, while the Ultra Power Saving will keep your phone alive for some extra time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus is properly equipped in terms of connectivity. The radio support includes up to four 2G bands, five 3G bands, and eight 4G bands. The LTE connectivity is Cat.7 which means up to 300Mbps downlink and up to 150Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our variant comes with a hybrid nano-SIM/microSD slot. Its second card can only hook to 2G networks while the first gets the full set of cellular connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus oddly supports single-band 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, with Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi+ and hotspot capabilities. Bluetooth is v4.1 and NFC are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS support includes A-GPS and GLONASS. There is an FM radio as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm jack provides the standard audio connectivity option. There is the new USB Type-C connector for charging and data connections. Mind you, it defaults to charge-only every single time you connect it to a PC, and you have to manually switch the mode from the notification area if you want to do something else.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Marshmallow + EMUI = Love<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, skinned with Huawei's Emotion UI, in its v.4.1 iteration. Emotion UI has been pretty consistent between versions and recurring Huawei users should feel right at home if upgrading to the nova plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of stuff going on the lockscreen, starting with the alternating cover images - every time you wake up the device, you're greeted by a different wallpaper. That's if you opt for some of the Magazine unlock styles. You can also go old-school and pick a single image to be shown on the lockscreen. Whatever you choose, you likely won't be seeing much of it, as the fingerprint unlock takes you straight to the homescreen instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do decide to wake up the nova plus via the power button, you get a large clock with a date, and a shortcut to the camera. You can also quickly start the camera by a double press of the Volume Down button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the lockscreen, you can pull up an iOS-style menu from the bottom, where you get yet another camera shortcut, but also quick access to the flashlight, calculator and voice recorder. If you've chosen the magazine style lockscreen, the pull-up menu will give you eight more options for control over the changing covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After unlocking you see a fairly standard Android homescreen with between 0 and 5 customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom and visible on all panes. There are eighteen homescreen panes at most, more than enough to house all of your apps since there is no app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well. If you like your homescreens neatly organized, you can enable the Shake feature, which will arrange scattered apps starting from the top left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theme options are available in the Emotion 4.1 UX. They can swap your wallpapers, icon pack, and lockscreen style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two panes - one that holds all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nova plus task switcher lets you swipe up and away unwanted apps. A downward swipe locks the app so that when you hit the Kill all button, it remains open. That's nifty if you are trying to free some RAM for a particular app or game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For certain scenarios, like in-car use, you can enable a Simple homescreen mode, which features large tiles for easy tapping. It's not particularly consistent, though, offering simple version of some menus, but not others - the dialer is the same size as in regular mode (in all fairness it's fairly oversized to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei had granular control over app permissions before it was cool, and there's no reason to change that, now that the feature comes as a part of latest Android Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nova plus features a notification center, courtesy of the Phone Manager app, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone Manager also features harassment filter, battery manager with power-saving modes, and options to choose which apps to run in the background and which not (protected apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of the extensive Smart assistance package, you can customize the bottom navigation bar - you can swap the task-switcher and back keys, or even add a shortcut for the notification area. There is also a one-handed UI mode, for easier menu surfing on the go, although it's hardly essential on a 5.5" screen like the one on the Huawei nova plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor on the back is also a clickable key (Smart key), on which you can assign up to three quick actions invoked on single press, double press, and press&amp;hold. You can assign app shortcuts, as well as actions such as torch or screenshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Floating dock - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your phone with just one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion control also plays a significant role on the nova plus. There are flip gestures, as well as picking up, tilting and even things like knuckle detection and drawing. All of those are extensively customizable to your liking as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scheduled power on and off is also available. The Smart Assistance package also offers Glove mode, and an option to prevent accidental unlocks while the nova plus is in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we've saved the best for the end. There are a couple of super useful gestures you can perform on the fingerprint sensor below the rear camera. Note that you can do those with any finger, there is no need of print recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can answer a call with touch and hold. Alarms can be turned off the same way. Snap a photo or capture a video with tap&amp;hold too. Then you can swipe down and up for showing/hiding the notification panel. We found all of those really cool and useful, so we recommend opting for these gestures. Those can be performed by any finger, not just the one(s) saved within the secure memory.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus is powered by the mid-range Snapdragon 625 chip, which is the sole reason not to put the nova plus among the top-end smartphones. The SoC offers a total of eight Cortex-A53 cores, running at 2.0 GHz, and a rather new Adreno 506 GPU. There are 3GB of RAM available on the nova plus, and unlike the G9 Plus there is no 4GB RAM (64GB) option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highlight of the chip is that it is manufactured using a 14nm process. It is the same fabrication process Qualcomm uses for its top-tier chips like the Snapdragon 820 and is still quite uncommon in mid-range chips. This should allow for less power consumption and lower running temperature than any other mid-range solution to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we kick off our routine with some CPU torture. In the single core test, it is not hard to see how any Cortex-A72 or Kryo unit performs a lot better than an isolated Cortex-A53.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, when you put enough of them together on a multi-threaded load, the higher clock rate starts to add up and lowers the gap between the latest Kirin (P9 Plus) and Snapdragon (OnePlus 3). Sure, the difference is still big, but we are talking mid-range here, so the score is perfectly fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the all-round benchmarks, we clearly see the Huawei nova plus holds its ground among mid-rangers such as Galaxy C7 and Xperia X, both similarly priced and positioned. Of course, it is not exactly a fair performance fight when we pit it against flagships like the OnePlus 3, the Honor 8 or the Galaxy S7 edge. However, the nova plus costs the same as those, so they need to be here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to graphics, the Adreno 506 bundled with the Snapdragon 625 provides an adequate match to CPU performance. That said, we definitely can't expect it to stand up to something like the Adreno 530 in the Snapdragon 820, but it is still more than adequate for almost every current Android game title in the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Basemark X provides an even better overview of where the Huawei nova plus fits graphics-wise among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus may not have the top-tier specs to impress, but it won't let down even power users. The eight 2.0 GHz cores are snappy, and the 3GB of RAM are still perfectly adequate for as much multitasking as you desire. Modern games run smooth, there is no lag in Android OS, and the phone stays cool even when its hardware is 100% busy for a long time. And that's more than enough for a great mid-ranger by our books.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus handles voice calls with ease and sound quality doesn't disappoint. The phone offers powerful dual-SIM manager in case you opt for the dual-SIM flavor, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock dialer app is a trinity of tabs bundled together - these include the Dialer, Contacts, and Favorites. The phonebook offers all the usual sorting and display options, it supports multiple accounts, and there are lots of fields available for each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus scored a Good mark in our standardized loudspeaker test. Our impressions from the speaker's sound quality are mostly positive - it produces deep and rich sound, but the default ringtones are rather quiet and you may miss some calls. Perhaps you can load a ringtone of your choosing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus ships with WPS office, which can be used for some basic document editing on the go. It can handle text documents, spreadsheets and presentations as well as PDF files. It can also export to PDF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone Manager is Huawei's do-it-all app for keeping control over your phone. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's a hell of a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery Manager is part of Phone Manager and includes a selection of three power plans with varying degrees of feature limitations. From here you can also control which apps can remain active after you send the phone to sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A file manager is also present, and it even supports batch operations.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus gallery app offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. Alternatively, you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The info icon up top gives some pretty detailed information about the image, including a histogram. Pulling down from anywhere on the screen lets you take a quick photo without leaving the gallery. The image comes out in a square 1:1 ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements. You can adjust levels and add individual watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to playing videos, the nova plus default player is pretty basic. Its sole option is playback speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The nova plus comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your playlists, too. The background of the app changes dynamically to match the album art, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as the antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS support, so you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nova Plus didn?t do particularly well in the active amplifier portion of the audio quality test. Its volume levels were below average and it?s intermodulation distortion and signal to noise readings that are particularly bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones, the stereo crosstalk rose an average amount, but the distortion and noise readings actually improved. Volume remained low however so it?s only a decent showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 16MP OIS shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus features a 16MP camera with optical stabilization, bright F2.0 aperture, phase detection and contrast detection hybrid autofocus, and a dual-tone LED flash. The camera pixels are 1.12µm big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camera app is straightforward if a little scattered. Swiping left or right in the virtual viewfinder lets you switch between still/video, and the nice Light painting, Beauty and Time-lapse modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the shooting modes you can select HDR, Manual (Professional) mode, Super Night, All focus, and Watermark (also available post-shot from the image editor), among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Light Painting mode shoots at 8MP and has four additional sub-modes - tail light trails, light graffiti, silky water, star track. Whatever the scene, your Huawei nova plus will first take a picture with the proper exposure settings and then it will capture the light trails of either cars, stars, water, or other moving objects. After you finish capturing those, the light trails will be automatically added to your picture. This process produces some stunning results if you keep the camera perfectly still while shooting - on a tripod or similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super Night mode is basically a slow shutter one, where the shutter speed and ISO are chosen automatically, depending on the scene, but you can tweak those if you like. The Manual option allows you to adjust all camera exposure settings as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped a couple of night shots for you. The auto mode does OK in terms of detail and contrast, but the focus often misses and we found ourselves taking a few test shots before the camera gets the focus right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Professional (manual) mode and a tripod allows for extending the shutter speed down to 4s or more, which often results in beautiful city night images. The focus issues remain, but you can always resort to using manual focus to be sure everything is fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's focus on the daylight image quality now. The 16MP samples came out with more than enough resolved detail and very good dynamic range. Noise levels are only average, the colors are accurate, and generally these are some solid-looking photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you may need HDR at some point of your shooting experience. You can check the HDR samples we took below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode is one of the better implementations on the market, switching automatically between portrait and landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting in portrait, panoramic images turn out just over 3,000 pixels tall and the samples below are about 30MP - not that far from a 180-degree sweep. Stitching is good, exposure is even, it's just that the captured detail and dynamic range are not quite the same as on the regular still images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera of the Huawei nova plus is an 8MP unit shooting images at 3,264 x 2,448 pixels. It's paired with a relatively bright f/2.0 lens. There is the obligatory beautification feature, which attempts to mask skin blemishes, but it mostly gets rid of any fine detail in the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for a regular photo, the resolved detail is quite satisfactory, the colors and contrast are great, too. It's one of the better selfie snappers we've seen, it also supports screen flash and shoot pleasant selfies most of the time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>4K video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the major flaws of previous Huawei smartphones is that they didn't support 2160p video recording. The Honor V8 was probably the first to offer it, and now both the nova and nova plus have 4K video capturing. Unfortunately, there is no 1080p video at 60fps option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2160p videos come out with a bitrate of 42Mbps while the 1080p ones are exactly half that. In either case, audio is recorded in stereo at 96kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos came out rich in detail, the colors are spot-on and the contrast is very good. The dynamic range is only about average, but still enough. There isn't any annoying focus hunting. The only real problem with the video samples is the poor audio quality of the sound that gets recorded along with the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the 4K videos, the 1080p ones came with average resolved detail, and yet they kept their cool with the contrast and colors. The audio is as poor as on the 4K samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are some 2160p and 1080p videos we uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've provided unedited samples straight out of the camera for you to download - 2160p@30fps (10s, 50MB), and 1080p@30fps (10s, 26MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Be sure to head over to our video compare tool to check where the Huawei nova plus stands against the rest.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Premium design, excellent and sleek build, lightweight for a phablet;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IPS display offers excellent contrast, but poor sunlight legibility, perhaps due to the average 400nits of maximum brightness;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is very good at 79 hours - the nova plus did well across all tests;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Marshmallow with Emotion UI UX is a powerful combo. There are lots of customization options, gestures, and proprietary services to enhance your Android experience;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 625 chipset offers consistent CPU and GPU performance, enough for its mid-range status. It runs modern games great, and hardly gets warm while doing so;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Average audio quality and low volume levels through the 3.5mm jack. The speaker loudness is very good, as is the sound quality;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great 16MP camera both in daylight and low-light, with high dynamic range, great contrast, colors, and low noise levels. The optical image stabilization allows for lower shutter speeds at night, but it isn't that good at stabilizing the otherwise impressive 4K videos. The 1080p videos are not as good looking though and the sound recorded with both the 4K and 1080p samples is very poor;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP selfies are very good with enough detail and accurate colors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei's on an upward trend and its recent phones are consistently showing it. The attention to detail on the exterior has been matched on the inside and the polished software is one of Huawei's definite strengths. This is really where the EMIUI is shining lately: innovative and helpful gestures, clean yet customizable interface and top-notch camera processing algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus was developed and built to a high standard. The airplane-grade aluminum has made it reasonably lightweight but sturdy, and it feels quite convincingly premium in terms of both hand feel and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The switch from Kirin to the latest midrange Snapdragon chip didn't take performance up to flagship levels, but helped improve the battery life and pretty much ruled out heating issues. The fingerprint sensor is among the best in class - blazing fast, always-on, super accurate, and it can be used with some really useful gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new 16MP OIS camera is quite good. The company has been adding new features and the nova plus benefits from all of them: the light painting mode with car trails, silky water or graffiti, the high-res panoramas, manual mode, super night shot with long exposure of up to 30s, among others. Oh, and the nova plus is among the first Huawei devices to offer 4K videos, which was long overdue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the nova plus is nicely designed and well-built, with a plethora of features to keep even the most demanding users interested. Here goes the cheatsheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there's one issue with the Huawei nova plus, it's the asking price. The company will be charging ?430 at launch, which is as much as some top-tier smartphones right now. For example, you can get the OnePlus 3 with a Snapdragon 820 chip, 6GB RAM, and a 5.5" AMOLED screen for a little less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you can grab the ZTE Axon 7, which not only comes with a 5.5" AMOLED screen, but also ups the resolution to Quad HD. There is the flagship Snapdragon 820 chip with 4GB of RAM inside, a 20MP OIS main camera, Dolby Atmos sound on stereo speakers, among other goodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei G9 Plus might be a better pick if you live in the right Asian country, as it is probably cheaper, and it's the local variant of the nova plus. Both smartphones are virtually the same. Or you can opt for the smaller 5" Huawei nova, which comes across as the better-looking device but its 12MP main camera comes without optical stabilization. The rest of the specs are identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently launched Honor 8 is another great in-house alternative with a faster chipset, better dual-camera setup on the back, and a premium all-glass design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy C7 offers similar build quality, screen, chipset and camera, and costs around the same. If you are after the AMOLED sweetness and TouchWiz, you should give this one a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto Z Play which is about to launch on the same price, offers quite a similar experience on a 5.5" AMOLED screen and Snapdragon 625 chip. The imaging skills are close enough too, but you will be getting the vanilla Android OS. The Z Play offers water-repellant coating, which the Huawei nova plus doesn't have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we should mention the LeEco Le Max 2 and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro, which prove that it is possible to match and even better the performance of a premium midranger for even less cash. Their availability however is quite limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei nova plus is the company's latest phablet, which steps on a solid foundation provided by the Mate series and benefits from the latest R&amp;D. It fetches quite a premium over the regular gang and its price pits it against some very potent smartphones. Not a very favorable position at this point but Huawei's consistency may as well pay back in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now it seems like Huawei is keen on adding depth to its lineup (like Samsung) and hanging hefty price tags (like Sony). But that's not the only things the Chinese have in common with the established brands. Huawei is getting better in making good phones, which match the Western taste and the nova plus is a prime example of that.</paragraph>
