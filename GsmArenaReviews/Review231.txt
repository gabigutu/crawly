			<paragraph>All right then, Samsung and Soul know better than simply recasting a slider as a bar. Samsung G400 Soul is the one Soul family member that easily gets singled out. The clamshell phone pulls off near RAZR size and style (save for the thickness), and boasts the unique dual screen setup and a 5 megapixel autofocus camera. Actually, this is the first 5 MP clamshell ever, though for some reason Samsung chose not to pitch that in their promos. Anyway, the G400 is one heavy piece of skill and style. And even if it's the odd one in terms of looks, it seems set to live up to that Soul pedigree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some may claim the G400 Soul design is too old school for a Samsung. OK, it's inconsistent with the Soul looks and quite akin to the well aged Moto RAZR concept. In fact the G400 has almost the same design as the Samsung Z560, which was set to compete with the Motorola RAZR V6 maxx.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the G400 rounds off the form factor supply within the Soul lineup and tries to meet some demand for full-featured flips. But so much for vintage vs. vantage - even if 5MP and HSDPA are nothing radical these days, it takes a flip to show off that sweet dual screen combo. For one of the most intriguing specs is the huge (in clamshell terms) touchscreen external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of full-featured flips, Samsung G400 Soul easily comes out as the top dog in the pack. Even so, it's not immune to pressure and the handset to probably give it the strongest run for its money though is Sony Ericsson W980. It's a tough call between the Soul flip and the Walkman flagship. With enough class and gloss to go around, it all boils down to 5MP imaging or FM transmitter and auto screen rotation. Anyway, enough either-ors, take the jump for the real thing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung G400 Soul 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung G400 Soul reminiscing of Moto RAZR is inevitable. Dimensions are almost exactly identical to the RAR2 V8, save for the thickness of course. The G400 Soul is lighter than the RAZR2 but, at 108 grams, remains a hefty piece that gives a solid feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a while, the Soul flip had us under the impression it's entirely made of metal. The metallic finish is there, no doubt about that - gloss up front and brushed at the rear - but essentially, it's all plastic underneath. We're not particularly fond of the mix of color nuances and surfaces that make up the exterior of the G400 Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, in terms of controls layout and ergonomics we like the Samsung G400 Soul. Topped with a very comfy - even if flatbed - alphanumeric keypad, it's way to go for Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In closed position, the Soul flip is a rare sight: do you dare call that external 2.2" touchscreen display secondary? All you get is a screen and the Samsung logo - nothing else is to be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping up will show you nothing you haven't already seen: the internal TFT display of QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels) totals 256K colors on a 2.2" diagonal. Above the display is the Samsung logo and the earpiece, the video-call camera alongside. The only bothersome thing here is that the open clamshell looks stunningly large - much like the impression you get when you flip Nokia N76 or the RAZ2 V8 up for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flatbed keypad is a pleasure to look at and use. The rows of keys are demarcated by thin etched borders, while the central column is flanked by stylish metallic ridges. The D-pad and surrounding controls are integrated with the alphanumeric keypad in one unbroken layout. Both navigation and typing are very user-friendly. The ample comfortable keys offer great touch orientation as well. Tiny rubber knobs under the keypad serve as flip cushions to keep the display off the keyboard in closed position and get rid of the irritating keypad imprints on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is backlit in relatively even and soft white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the flip is up, the 5 megapixel camera lens, which is placed on the hinge, is facing the user and can be conveniently used for self-portraits (bit not that comfortable for regular shooting). Next to the camera lens is the LED flash. In closed position, the camera is much more usable for shooting images - the external display serves as a viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the external display can be used for viewing the images after pressing the album icon. The touchscreen functionality makes things even more convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of G400 features only the microSD card slot with a plastic cover and the lifted volume rocker. At the very top is the convenient lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right hand side sports the universal port for charging, data and connecting the stereo headset. Next is the hold key, which locks the external display. The dedicated two-way shutter key is all the way down the bottom - perfect position for shooting with the clamshell folded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom feature no controls or functional elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed metallic surface of the battery cover has another Samsung logo engraved and that's all you get rearside when the flip is up. Like we said, the camera lens is on the hinge and it's only visible at the back when the clamshell is folded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Li-Ion battery in our beta unit was of undisclosed capacity and Samsung haven't yet specified standby and talk time. We're unable to comment on battery life at this point for the limited time we spent with the handset. Suffice to say, a battery of over 1000 mAh will probably only do justice to this handset given the dual display set up and the large external touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up, Samsung G400 Soul is one big flip but the ample outer touchscreen is a good enough excuse. Plus, the solid feel and comfortable handling are downright commendable. We did notice a minor flaw though and it concerns opening the clamshell single-handedly. There is no recess to use to effortlessly thumb the flip up. Additionally, the polished metallic casing causes the handset to easily slip off your fingers. The folding mechanism works like a charm though: the hinge holds softly and evenly to ensure a smooth flip open.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays: deprived by the sun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G400 Soul displays have the same old story to tell. Vibrant and sharp indoors, the screens do struggle outside in bright sun. Legibility suffers a great deal, especially with low contrast themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer screen is even worse for its mirror finish - it's a safe bet that you'll quickly lose track if you're to use the phone under direct sunlight. However we do have to say that we admire the touchscreen, even if it is doesn't give you full control over the phone and its features. To be honest, it's pretty much limited to multimedia (much like the touch-sensitive display of KF750), with no way to get to the settings or the main menu. Reading an incoming SMS is also impossible, unlike the RAZR2 V8 where you could not only read, but even reply to texts with predefined templates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony - not that great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul has a really loud earpiece. During calls we had to turn down the volume by at least half, to not hurt our ears. You'll experience no problems hearing the other party even in the loudest of environments. Loudness is only one side of the coin though. Excited as we were about the clarity and vibrancy of the other two Soul handsets, the G400 earpiece quality seems utterly no match - it does sound muffled and blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Samsung G400 Soul through our traditional speakerphone test. Here is how it stacks against some of the other handsets we've measured. In our ranking system, it's just a whisker short of "Excellent", but we won't be fussy. G400 Soul is an excellent performer and that pretty much backs up our first impressions before the test. You can find more info on the test itself and the other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung, as you always have some sort of dialing animation, or a choice of several ones. In the case of Samsung G400 Soul you have as many as six: Quill pen, Sticky note, two named "Normal", Living world and Theme. The last two vary a little according to the theme or your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart dialing feature can assist dialing by looking up your phonebook for contacts whose names contain characters corresponding to the digits you've typed. The Samsung G400 Soul also automatically looks up contacts, whose numbers contain the typed digits. The two types of searches really allow you the quickest access to any contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface - Soul tradition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Samsung G400 Soul is a slightly improved version of what we saw in the Ultra II line of handsets. It brings greater customization and some minor novelties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of G400 Soul is typical Samsung. There are nice graphical transitions between screens with the great speed and responsiveness of Samsung G400 Soul. The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display by pressing the center key of the ample D-pad. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. The four directions of the touchpad have shortcuts of their own and these can be changed to best suit the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice option for the wallpaper is that you can select a number of photos that can run in slide show on the homescreen. The transition effect is configurable too. On the other hand, we saw a feature we appreciated back in D900 missing in the Soul - the option to have the calendar display on the homescreen in standby mode. That's not a big miss though, as the external display has this function, along with a digital and an analog clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as either a 4 x 3 grid of icons or a standard list. Sub-menus appear as lists. The much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, where the last used items and sub-items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu is also present here. We like it this way and it proves useful when you use a given feature more than once. Still some may have other needs and will have every right to disagree.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul surely won't get users bored. It offers a great number of customization options. The three preinstalled themes are all very nice and we happened to particularly enjoy the one named Monolithic Purity. It suits the phone exterior, though not nearly as sweetly as with the other two Soul handsets. You can also create your own theme, tuning every single element to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third available theme, called Samsung Theme, takes after the main menu of Samsung F480, a phone we reviewed in detail a couple of months ago. The thing we are missing here is the three different font sizes for the user interface. These were greatly appreciated in Samsung U600 and it's a pity they are not available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook as usual too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of G400 Soul is typical Samsung again. Up to 1000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Smart Dialing we mentioned earlier. Unluckily, Samsung G400 soul - much like the other Soul phones - searches only in the contact's first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 2 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that is now becoming pretty common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field, which can be set as a calendar event with only a few clicks. This is quite a convenient solution. Contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call logging has also been slightly improved in comparison to the previous Samsung U-models. Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give you access to the application. It has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls. Those tabs used to be somewhat inconveniently separate but with Samsung G400 Soul this is no longer a problem. From the Call log, users can add separate numbers to a reject list. When there is incoming call from a blocked number, it is displayed in the call log as usual without any indication of it being blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul handles all common types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. The first three share the same editor. You can covert your SMS to EMS by simply applying formatting or to MMS by inserting an image or other multimedia content. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try resending it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS, 30 push messages, 200 broadcast messages and 30 configuration messages in the phone memory. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the available memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very good. It can manage POP or IMAP accounts; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 30 minutes to 1 day).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file browser in Samsung G400 Soul is the same as the one in Samsung U900 Soul varying only in the phone and memory card storage separated in different tabs. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, even if you misplace a file, the handset will still handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser functionality is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones). Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one or multiple at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. Memory card reading is normal - we didn't find significant lags in reading a new memory card. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is now quick enough too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested two microSDHC memory cards with Samsung G400 Soul - a 4GB one and an 8GB one. Both cards were recognized by the handset and it had no problems with them except for the lengthy initial recognition time. Both memory cards were full of music files and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G400 Soul's picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening a folder that contains images. You can now copy or move images to any folder of your liking, unlike previous Samsung handses where only the Images folder was available for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures are seen as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view a picture in portrait mode only, unless you apply the fullscreen view mode which switches the gallery to landscape. You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is quite slow and irritating.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editing is sweet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's a very capable application, especially for a non-smartphone. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung G400 Soul offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. However, we still doubt it anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player for the Soul<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with generous internal memory of 120MB and a microSD card slot, the Samsung G400 Soul has every premise to act as a portable music player. It is therefore important that the music player application be up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composer. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. There are 7 equalizer presets called Sound effects. Beside those you also get wide and surround options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G400 Soul comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't have many features but all the essentials are covered - it can play video in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul is a very good performer in terms of audio quality. We are fully satisfied with most of the values, except the total harmonic distortion and inter modulation distortion where the values deviate significantly. We are aware that these results might be due to the beta version of the G400 we're reviewing and hope that the problems will be fixed before the handset hits the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung G400 Soul lacks a standard 3.5 mm or even a 2.5 mm audio jack. You're therefore limited in your choice of headsets, unless of course you find a suitable adapter. Then again, you can use a Bluetooth headset - both mono and stereo will do, as Samsung G400 Soul supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul is an underachiever in total harmonic and inter modulation distortion.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Five megapixel flip<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul is equipped with a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with maximum image resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. Interestingly, the camera is intended to use with the flip closed and controlled via the external touch sensitive display. You can also use the camera with the flip open, with the internal display serving as a self portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface in the internal display very much resembles that of Samsung U900 Soul. The settings and the other controls are a bit complicated as usual but the extended features make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more important settings are picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, and frame), effects (black and white, sepia, negative etc.), white balance and face detection. The face detection feature itself works pretty well and is even capable of recognizing several faces simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional camera settings include wide dynamic range, anti-shake, picture quality and ISO settings. Exposure metering is also configurable and the auto focus can be switched off if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before proceeding with our impressions of the image quality we will show you how well the external display works for the camera handling. When the phone is closed the camera can be activated via the dedicated camera key, or through the dedicated icon on the multimedia menu on the screen. The top of the display shows the current camera settings, such as camera mode, storage, image resolution, flash status, white balance, ISO, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single tap on the display will bring up additional icons for extra settings such as exposure compensation, mode, options, album, back and zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings bar at the bottom lets you control all the camera options using the icons with tiny labels. When you hit options you get to shooting mode, size, flash, timer, face detection and effects. Scrolling down will reveal white balance and the viewfinder mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we are more than pleased with the interface as it is quite intuitive and comfortable to use, thanks to the ample icons with labels and the touch sensitive display of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough on the interface, let's take our time and admire the lovely shots the 5MP camera is capable of producing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Samsung G400 Soul is impressive. We're especially fond of the image processing, with balanced in-camera sharpening, low noise and remarkable scene detail. You would only see such results in ? well, the U900 Soul. By the way, the occasionally noticeable red tint that Samsung U900 Soul suffers is clearly dealt with in G400. The wide dynamic range option doesn't help with highlights, but brings in quite a lot of detail in the shadow areas at the cost of somewhat increased noise. Our guess is that you can do the same in Photoshop CS with the Shadow/Highlight function, but anyway it's a good feature to have in your phone. Having it switched on permanently is not an option however. It doesn't do images any good in low contrast scenes anyway, and besides it keeps turning off every time you switch the camera off. Check out some samples from the Samsung G400 Soul camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just to give you an idea of what those photos can turn out with just a wee bit of photoediting, here are some images downsized to 1024x768.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recoding is concerned, Samsung G400 Soul failed to impress. The highest resolution available is QVGA@15fps and that's a no-go these days, especially when recorded in 3gp format. The videos might turn out usable on some rare occasions anyway. We can't help our disappointment, as VGA recording would have been the icing on the cake for the G400 Soul's camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung G400 Soul you can count on 3G with HSDPA support and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. No EDGE is a pity - it could've been a handy back-up for browsing in areas where 3G networking is not available. Leaving that aside, the 7.2 Mbps HSDPA is the quickest there is, so Soul users should count themselves lucky. Not that such speed is actually achievable but maybe in the years to come this will change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, Samsung G400 Soul also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. There is also A2DP support. The phone works seamlessly when transferring data to and from PC. A notable enhancement to the Bluetooth File Browser service is the ability to make certain files or folders visible or invisible according to your needs. The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default or otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser limited in features - again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Web browser of Samsung G400 Soul leaves somewhat mixed impressions. We were glad to see a NetFront 3.4 web browser used, as we know what it is capable of. It turned out though its capabilities were seriously trimmed down in the G400 Soul. There is no landscape view mode and the page resize feature doesn't work all that well. When reducing the size, the font isn't handled properly and any text on the screen becomes compressed to being downright illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also no trace of the mouse pointer we've been seeing in some of the recent Samsung and Sony Ericsson handsets that use the same version of the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, pages are rendered well in both desktop and Smart-fit view mode. However, as mentioned, this only holds true if you are using the default page size.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications and functionality of the external display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of flips, the two screens can be both a curse and a blessing. Well, except for those ultra low-end clamshells, which don't even have an outer display: blessed are the meek? Yes, we've come to regard the smaller external screens on clamshells as a necessary evil. But hey, you can't fight evolution. The first one to try and show what we'd been missing was the RAZR2 V8 with its great secondary screen - same resolution, only 0.2" short of the main display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G400 Soul though is truly spoiling flip users. What we have is two equal displays - both in terms of resolution/size and colors supported. On top of that, the outer screen is sweetly touch-enabled all over!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external touchscreen proves great for launching and controlling the assigned applications. So much so that its limitations don't seem such a burden: you don't get full control over phone settings and navigating the menus, the way you would with the phone flipped up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking of settings, each of the two displays amazingly has its own dedicated settings for the home screen, wallpaper, themes, brightness and backlighting. Haptics are the final extra that adds to the excitement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, a sobering note: the sunlight legibility of the external display is disastrous, due to the mirror finish and less intensive backlighting. It's extremely hard to see the text under the icons outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose among four types of home screen layouts - two digital clocks with a date, one analog clock, and calendar view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remember the LG Secret Touch Media interface? Here in Samsung G400 Soul, things don't differ much. The G400 Soul's outer touchscreen functionality is limited to multimedia: music player, FM radio, camera and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is definitely our favorite but we had enough on that in the camera chapter of this review. Feels like time to pay due respect to the music player. We quite liked managing music via the external display - the menu icons are big and comfy; settings are intuitive and nicely at hand with icons and labels. The options and settings are exactly the same as when you're using the regular interface and the main display to control the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album interface is also quite up to scratch. The image zooming touch control is more natural and you can drag and pan the image as much as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, let's look at how calls are handled with the external display. An incoming call can be rejected but cannot be answered. You can also call back in the case of a missed call, but when connection is established an "open flip" message will prompt you to open the clamshell to talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An incoming SMS cannot be read and that's our greatest disappointment with the external display functionality. If the phone has been locked with the hold key, you will see different images each time you wake it up, which is quite a nice option actually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G400 Soul calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available for setting up: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important and private. Each of those has its own unique fields and an alarm can be set to remind of it. The Calendar can store up to 100 appointments, 50 anniversaries, 50 holidays, 20 important and 20 private events. Much like with previous Samsung handsets, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots on Samsung G400 Soul. Each of them can have its own snooze time, number of repetitions and activation days. The volume can also be different for each alarm and all but one of them can be renamed to the user's liking. The Wake-up alarm is the exception. Furthermore, you can set different tones for each alarm and you can choose whether it should trigger phone vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world clock application, a calculator, and a unit convertor. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably seem appealing to sports-minded users. There is also a handy to-do manager that can help you organize your time better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in Samsung G400 Soul is the integrated document viewer. It supports MS Word, MS Excel and PDF files and handles them all pretty well. However, the application is so slow it ruins the whole experience. Both scrolling and zooming on documents does take ages and we find that quite annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All those who like the Soul can now do it body and soul: the lineup has it all already in terms of form factor. And it's definitely not like throwing in a clamshell just for the sake of having one. Samsung G400 Soul brings a notable "first-to" record. Not only is it the first 5 megapixel clamshell, but is well decked out with niceties like face detection, image stabilization, and wide dynamic range and excellent image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>G400 Soul also stands out with that dual screen setup: two equal in size and resolution TFT displays. Touchscreen and haptics on top are just as sweet. Add the good set of features and you get yourself a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designwise, we could wish the phone was a little more compact, especially with the flip up. The poor sunlight legibility of the external display also ruins some of the experience. QVGA video recording at 15fps is the other thing we're not happy to see in a hi-end cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, the Samsung G400 appeal is likely to extend beyond the clamshell devotees. The Soul pedigree (enhanced by distinct exterior), the great imaging and the balanced feature set will possibly convince those who like to weigh benefits against costs. The style conscious will make up their mind a lot easier.</paragraph>
