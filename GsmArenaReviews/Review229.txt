			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson is making headlines again today, but the three fresh Walkmans is no news any more. The news is we got the actual handsets and our coverage goes deeper with a quick preview of the three new phones to hit the Walkman lineup. We already introduced the 5-megapixel Sony Ericsson W902, the cute slider W595 and the compact W302, which were chosen by Sony Ericsson to celebrate the third birthday of the Walkman series. We're now heading beyond the headlines, while the news of their announcement is still hot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not going for a feature comparison since the three newcomers are running in different lanes and targeting different segments. We'll be focusing instead on the novelties they bring to the Sony Ericsson portfolio and their implementation. All the devices we received for reviewing are working pre-release units. They are in for some minor bugs, but nothing too disturbing. In other words, the preview should give you quite a close idea of what to expect from the new Walkmans.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W902<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 is quite understandably the handset to create the biggest hype. The first 5 megapixel Walkman takes a bold Cybershot-meets-Wseries stand, much to the delight of Sony Ericsson devotees. Walkmans have so far been below-par in terms of imaging (save for the W800 back in the day), forcing upon users the dreadful choice between a good camera and good music package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 is a tough challenge for the current Walkman flagship W980. The newbie has a better camera, card slot, screen auto rotation and ships with 8GB M2 cards against the FM transmitter, touch-sensitive music controls and 8GB of built-in storage of W980. All in all, the choice between the two boils down to your personal priorities and taste.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W595<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the Sony Ericsson W595. The slider does make a great first impression with slick looks and comfortable handling. It also has all the currently available Walkman niceties, including SenseMe and Shake control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the W595 has quite a decent feature set and appears a viable successor of the very successful Sony Ericsson W580. The mid-range slider is well due for an upgrade. Much like its predecessor, W595 has the responsible task of adding a touch of style to the Walkman mid-ranks. Our initial impressions are that it's quite up to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W302<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last star of the day is the clean-cut Sony Ericsson W302. The extremely compact bar is distinguished by its minimalist design with solid build and brushed metal panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming with a good deal of Walkman skill and a nice camera interface, the W302 might turn a great success if tagged with the right price. It feels great to handle and, despite a few beta stage issues, did manage a good impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all the previewing we have ahead, it's about time we skipped the small talk and got to work. Hit the jump for our first impressions of Sony Ericsson W902. The other two are close in line.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W902 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 flaunts a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash and dedicated music controls. It has a 2.2" 262K-color QVGA screen and 25MB of built-in memory. The pre-bundled 8GB M2 memory card is a nice perk worth noting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other niceties include screen auto rotation thanks to the built-in accelerometer and image geotagging. Since it doesn't have a GPS receiver, the geotagging feature will rely on cell towers to estimate your location. Aiming to be one of Sony Ericsson's multimedia flagships, you can bet FM radio with RDS and stereo Bluetooth are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3G and HSDPA-enabled W902 will be available in Volcanic Black, Wine Red and Earth Green versions from Q4 of 2008.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 measures 110 x 49 x 11.7mm and weighs 99.8 grams. It is indeed very pocket-friendly. We are however not so impressed with the design. No, there's nothing wrong with looks, but it's simply no different than most others 3-year old Walkmans. Frankly, we are getting tired of seeing the same designs reused over and over. However we bet Sony Ericsson W902 can still see appreciation among the conservative Walkman fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music keys on the right of Sony Ericsson W902 should be one of the best things about its ergonomics. They allow quick control of the Walkman player without even having to open the application itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did have some hard time getting used to them, as they are placed where your hand would normally rest when holding the phone. Accidental starts of the music player do tend to be rather annoying at first but after some time with the handset you get used to holding it without pressing those music keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman key is also aboard the Sony Ericsson W902. It is used for accessing the Walkman 3.0 application and for using the Shake control. This means that you can change tracks and even shuffle your whole playlist on the W902 by a simple flick of the hand while holding down the Walkman key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A huge loudspeaker aperture is to be seen on the top of the front panel of the W902. The actual earpiece only takes less than a quarter of it. On either side are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under them we find the 2.2" 262K-color display of QVGA resolution. The display of the W902 is really impressive. It has great contrast and really vibrant picture. The brightness levels are also good enough, to secure an excellent mark for the display picture quality indoors. We haven't yet got around to testing its sunlight legibility but we will as soon as possible as it's going to stay with us several more days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Sony Ericsson W902 is quite alright. The keys are well-sized with enough spacing between rows. We could have wished for a bit wider borders between keys on the same row. Anyway, with the more than adequate press feedback, we are willing to forgive that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six control and navigation keys orbiting the D-pad. While we have little complaints about the D-pad, the Call and end keys are a bit too small for our liking, and so are the selection keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The control we probably like best on the W902 is the dedicated camera key. It is large enough and comfortable to press, a nice taster of the improved camera performance in the new Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera, the LED flash and the loudspeaker. A lanyard eyelet is also here. The worst part about the back panel is the Sony Ericsson logo. The thing is it sticks out a few millimeters causing the handset to wobble when rested on its back. In addition to the unpleasant feel, that also means that the logo will be the first thing to experience the everyday wear and tear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back panel is the M2 card slot and the BST-38 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 930 mAh. Quoted at the impressive 9 hours of talk time and 380 hours of stand-by the battery should be more than adequate for almost every user. Even intensive music playback, which a Walkman will sure get, should not be able to drain it too fast. Luckily the memory card slot is hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of Sony Ericsson W902 is very good. We wouldn't want to rush to conclusions given the short time spent with it but the handset seems sturdy enough. The plastic casing might have made some use of a few metal ornaments here and there but that's a minor issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other thing we have to note is the slight creak the back-panel occasionally produces. It might as well be solved in the retail version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A high-end phone, it is no wonder Sony Ericsson W902 has the most advanced version of the user interface of the house. The UI has the typical Sony Ericsson feature phone styling, and offers an extensive set of options and settings. They are also complimented with great speed, which even further improves user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four options for the main menu layout of Sony Ericsson W902. In addition to the traditional 4 x 3 grid, the main menu now has a couple of alternative views: rotating and single icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last option is to use the layout of the currently selected Flash Lite theme. In fact, the support of Flash Lite themes is the thing that lets you customize the interface of your W902 beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 also features the three soft key layout and the well-known Activity menu, which is a really handy, especially for a feature phone. It offers quick access to a number of selected functions and even multi-tasking to some extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most previous models, Sony Ericsson W902 comes with a dedicated Flight mode. It switches all transceivers off but, unluckily, requires a reboot. The other problem with the flight mode is that it can only work with a SIM card inserted, which we find outdated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 features the Walkman 3.0 player with all possible extras included. Accessed from the really nice Media menu, the player supports a vast collection of file formats and has several equalizer presets. In addition, you also get Album art and the proprietary Sony Ericsson Shake control making use of the phone's built-in accelerometer. The accelerometer is also put to use for automatic rotation of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to hear. The D-pad is in charge of music controls and also brings up a list of all the tracks in the current playlist or album. As we already mentioned, the keys on the side of W902 are a nice set of alternative music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you minimize the music player, the currently playing track, album and artist get displayed on the home screen with some nice graphics that perfectly blend with the screen if a Flash Lite theme is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers appear as fullscreen graphics on the Sony Ericsson W902. You can also create a custom equalizer if the presets don't do the trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly promoted Walkman feature is Shake control. It allows you to change the currently running track and even shuffle your entire playlist by a simple flick of the hand. All you need to do to use Shake control is press the Walkman key and shake the phone forward (for going one track forward) or backward (for going a track back). A quick succession of the two moves does the shuffle trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other high pitched Walkman goodie, SensMe, is a nice alternative for browsing your music collection. It gives you the opportunity to search tracks that match a certain mood instead of a specific artist, album or genre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, setting up the mood of any given track manually is impossible. This means that if you simply copy a bunch of tracks to your Sony Ericsson W902 they won't be available for the SenseMe feature. In order to make the SensMe work, you need to upload your music to the phone via the Sony Ericsson Media Manager software for PC with the SensMe Analysis option enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 also has an FM radio with RDS. It has memory for 20 stations and sports the TrackID music recognition service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 5 megapixel camera is the first of a kind in the Walkman family. Now, that means its place in the spotlight is guaranteed. It is also complimented with a LED flash. However, you shouldn't expect great night shots if your subjects are more than a meter away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best parts about the W902 camera is the user interface. It is using the same layout as its Cyber-shot siblings and we find this to be the most user-friendly interface existing in a phone. The camera settings use the tab layout with the available options appearing when the corresponding icon is selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few samples from the camera of the W902 for you to enjoy:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this early stage, the Sony Ericsson W902 camera seems to produce nice results - accurate colors and white balance. The details level is high enough, but still all photos suffer from heavy purple fringing. Oversharpening is causing some damage too. We believe however this will be fixed in the retail version of the W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video is concerned, the Sony Ericsson W902 can record QVGA resolution video at 30fps. While videos turn out smooth and nice looking, we cannot help to note that those video recording capabilities are well below the current high-end cameraphone range. VGA videos have four times the resolution and there are already non-smartphone devices that are capable of recording QVGA video at 120 fps (you didn?t hear us say LG, right?).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W902 preview conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 is a great overall performer with a reasonably good camera and a state-of-the-art multimedia menu. The Walkman 3.0 music player is hardly rivaled by any other company and as a whole the user interface of the Walkman leaves only positive impressions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the pricing and looks also take part here and, if the price tag isn't right, the Samsung U900 Soul might just turn out to be a more tempting offer with much sleeker looks. We are also yet to see how the camera of the retail version of the W902 will compare to the one of the Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're back after the jump with a bit of Sony Ericsson W595 previewing. We've got a sleek slider coming and we're itching to see how it fares.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W595 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 boasts quad-band GSM support and 3G with HSDPA. The slider also packs a 3 megapixel camera, which sadly lacks autofocus. The display is a 2.2" 262K-color QVGA unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects - Bluetooth (with A2DP), USB (Sony Ericsson's proprietary port) and FM radio with RDS are all on board. A 2GB M2 memory card comes in the retail package to top the 40MB of built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color versions of the Sony Ericsson W595 are Active Blue, Cosmopolitan White, Jungle Grey and Lava Black. The handset will be released in Q4 of 2008.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W595 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Expected to succeed the W580, the W595 has the same slider form factor and superior looks. The rubbery surface on the back and sides, and the metallic accents really boost the handling and the visuals of the device. The slanting top and bottom also remind of the good old W580 and are much to our liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Measuring 100 x 47 x 14 mm and weighing 104 g the W595 is quite pocketable. The 2.2" 262K-color QVGA display takes most of the front panel and it does score a point for the Sony Ericsson W595. It has a really sharp and lively picture with great contrast and brightness levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys below the display are just the same as the W902 in terms of functionality but this time they are much larger and thus more comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is revealed by sliding the Sony Ericsson W595 open. We did find it generally comfortable to use although it is somewhat lacking in terms of press feedback. The keys are large enough with sufficient spacing between each two and that makes it easy to type without looking at the keypad at all. The keys also seem durable, so the W580 notorious cracking keypad issues seem unlikely with the W595.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman key on Sony Ericsson W595 is on the right side and grants access to the same features as with the W902 - accessing the Walkman player and using the Shake control. The key is however a bit smaller than we would have liked it to be. It is in fact rather hard to press but you can probably get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 is equipped with stereo speakers that are placed at the sloping top and bottom. This layout is rather useful if you listen to music with the phone laid on a flat surface. Thankfully, the Sony Ericsson logo on the back of the W595 is embedded, so resting the phone on a table will cause no wobbling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three megapixel camera lens is located at the back. Unlike the W902, the W595 lacks a flash to help with night-time shooting. Now, add the fixed focus and you get the idea that photography wasn't high on the company's list of priorities with this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover of the W595 reveals the 950 mAh BST-33 Li-Po battery. It is quoted at 9 hours of talk time and 385 hours of stand-by time, which is basically the same as the Sony Ericsson W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest under the Sony Ericsson's W595 back panel is the M2 card slot, which is used for expanding the 40 MB of built-in memory. The 2 GB card that ships with the handset will probably be enough for most users but the rest can freely go for higher capacity cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Sony Ericsson W595 is great. The handset feels great in hand and there were no creaking sounds whatsoever. The rubberized surface also provides one of the best grips we have seen in a mobile phone - the W595 just sticks to your hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The W595 user interface is the same as on the W902 - user-friendly, quick and with a lot of available options and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The support of Flash Lite themes lets you customize the interface of your W595 all over. The menus and the general layout is also the same as in W902 and in fact we didn't manage to find any difference between the two UIs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 comes with the three soft key layout and the Activity menu, which means multi-tasking is enabled. And as all the positives of the W902 apply to the W595, so do the negatives - a SIM card is required even if you plan to use the phone in flight mode only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of Sony Ericsson W595 is also the same as the one on the W902. You can go a page back if you need to refresh your knowledge about it. All the niceties are also here - the SenseMe music browsing, the Shake control and the automatic screen rotation, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another common element of the W902 and the W595 is the picture gallery. It is surely one of the best we've found in a mobile phone. It's a convenient tool for managing a vast collection of pictures with great customization capabilities and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, timeline view for your images and tags that can later be used for filtering. With Sony Ericsson W595 you can also mark some of your photos as favorite and make accessing them even easier through the favorite photo feed. Furthermore, the gallery is extremely eye-pleasing with nice transition effects being all over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True to their Walkman nature, the Sony Ericsson W595 and W902 really know how to make a nice slide show. It prompts picking a mood before you start, so it can set the proper background music and transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 also has kept the FM radio functionality of the W902. This means that RDS and TrackID come on board and so does memory for 20 stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 features a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera with no flash whatsoever. The specs suggest that this is not the best part of the phone but users still have an imaging option at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is surely the best part of the shooting with the W595. Once again we have to say it - the Cyber-shot interface does take shooting with your mobile phone a level up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the sample photos from Sony Ericsson W595 camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a mind we are dealing with a pre-release unit here, we found the W595 photos to be extremely oversharpened. That usually ruins the photos and we guess it will be fine tuned before the official release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside that the W595 failed to nail the correct white balance - all photos have a colder white balance than the original scene. The level of detail however is satisfactory and there are no traces of purple fringing, which is commendable, as purple fringing have been plaguing Sony Ericsson cameraphones for quite some time now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the video recording capabilities are concerned, the Sony Ericsson W595 manages the modest QVGA resolution at 15 fps. Needless to say, clips at such resolution and frame rate are rarely usable, so don't count on this handset replacing your current camcorder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W595 preview conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W595 is probably the handset that managed to please us most today. It has the performance of its bigger brother - the W902 and almost all its features (save for the camera part). However the W595 does look a whole lot neater and sharper and, having in mind that it will be targeted at a lower segment, it has some great potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we are to answer if Sony Ericsson produced a worthy successor of the W580 - they certainly did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that Sony Ericsson need to worry about is the release date of the W595. With at least three more months to go, the competition in this market segment might even get more severe than it is now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now join us after the jump for the final piece of Sony Ericsson gear that we are previewing today - the W302. Who knows - the cute bar might just turn out to be a great surprise.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W302 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing revolutionary about the Sony Ericsson W302. It is a lower midrange device, which however is both attractive and well built. The W302 is really compact and light, and it's almost destined to become a success - given the right price tag of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featurewise, the quad-band Sony Ericsson W302 doesn't have the high-tech goodies of the more advanced Sony Ericsson phones. There's no 3G support, Media manager, accelerometer or even auto focus. But the W302 offers snappy performance with strong music orientation - the Walkman music player, the FM radio and the stereo Bluetooth support all attest to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 has a 2" display with a resolution of only 176 x 220 pixels but the interface graphics are ingeniously scaled down, so the low resolution doesn't hurt the looks or usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W302 also has a 2 megapixel camera, which lacks auto focus but has the Cyber-shot style interface. We missed that ever since Sony Ericsson W910 when we last saw it on a Walkman device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 should be available in Midnight Black or Sparkling White in Q4 2008 and a reasonable price tag will surely make it a real hit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W302 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 is one little looker with that slim waistline. The design concept is nothing new but the W302 leaves a really nice impression at first glance. The W302 measures 100 x 46 x 10.5 mm and weighs the mere 78g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of you probably may not agree, but if we leave the slim body aside, the device reminds a lot of the black Samsung E590, which by the way is already selling dirty cheap and offers the same feature load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylish brushed metal finish up front and the slip-free rear surface add to those nice looks and comfortable handling. The 10.5mm thickness rounds off a nice piece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clean-cut keys on the keypad offer nice press feedback and are a pleasure to use for typing. Tactility is flawless as all the keys are sufficiently distinct. The keypad has a nice orange backlighting to reiterate its Walkman bloodline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side there's a dedicated Walkman key. The right-hand side hosts the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. Unfortunately, the camera lacks auto focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 is equipped with standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Polymer battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. It's quoted at up to 300 h of standby time and up to 7 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface is clean and simple<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W302 comes with 20MB of internal memory, but as Walkman usually has it, a memory card is part of the retail package. In this case it's a 512MB M2 unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The context keys in the interface follow the three-key layout found in all recent Sony Ericsson phones. Thanks to the Flash Lite theme support, the interface can be changed beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the more expensive Sony Ericsson handsets, the W302 lacks an Activity menu, which allows some multi-taksing. Instead, it only offers a customizable shortucts list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 image gallery is nothing spectacular. There is no Media manager for browsing multimedia files, so you have to rely on the regular file browser for this purpose. As we already pointed, the W302 offers excellent responsiveness, so browsing the 2 megapixel images was a breeze. Unfortunately, images cannot be browsed in landscape mode nor they can be zoomed in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a second (and better) image gallery however, which is accessible only from the camera interface. It displays the images in landscape orientation for a more pleasant browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W350 is equipped with the Walkman music player 2.0, which is found on handsets such as the Sony Ericsson W350 for example. It has several equalizer presets but the proprietary Mega Bass is not among them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can be set to run in the background, so you can do other things while listening to music. When in background mode, the title and artist get displayed in the top part of the screen. The player is intuitive and really easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can use the keypad backlighting as light effects, which blink to the rhythm of the currently playing track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two other skins beside the standard black one and you can use those to suit your themes, since the theming itself doesn't change the music player interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player can display the album cover during playback or you can choose from the other available visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 also has an FM radio that supports RDS. An extra feature is the TrackID music recognition service. If you want to get the name of a track that's playing on the radio, you just fire it up, it records several seconds from it and hopefully, gives back the name and artist after looking up the Gracenote servers (data charges apply if you are not on a flat rate data plan).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the TrackID service to record a sample of a track through the handset microphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W302 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera that produces images with a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. It's got the really sleek Cyber-shot interface but without most of the high-end features. Auto focus or LED flash are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got a dedicated burst mode that takes four snapshots in quick succession for capturing action shots. Unfortunately, in Burst mode the camera shoots in VGA resolution only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also offers a Night mode, a self timer, some color effects and white balance settings. There is no choice of shutter sounds, but the existing tone can be muted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of samples from the Sony Ericsson W302 camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality was a nice surprise - it looks good for a 2 megapixel camera, but it still falls short of the best 2 megapixel examples we've seen recently - such as the Samsung D780, for example. You can check out some of its samples here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the W302 pulled off some nice shots with balanced sharpening and no traces of purple fringing. Contrast and colors are ok too. The W302 camera failed to capture the right white balance much like the W595, however this time we are dealing with a warmer setup, which is more pleasant than the slight bluish cast produced by W595.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Sony Ericsson W302 captures video in the meager QCIF resolution at 15 fps in 3GP format.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W302 preview conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 is without a doubt one looker of a handset. Featurewise it seems the most balanced Walkman handset to date in its segment. The nice music package and the slim profile will probably be its strongest selling points. Well, with the right price tag, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of handsets already to offer even better feature sets in this segment and while the W302 certainly has its place in the Sony Ericsson portfolio, we can't help the feeling it comes at least a year late. Nokia 5310 is already gaining popularity and it's been around long enough to finally reach rather acceptable price levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U600 is another excellent alternative although it's a different form factor - it has a nice display, excellent camera and top notch audio quality. And both these handset can be found for around 150 euro SIM-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So without underestimating the Sony Ericsson W302 potential and qualities, we do believe its success is very much staked on a reasonable price tag.</paragraph>
