			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back in 2012, the simple and affordable Xperia E was targeting youths and first-time smartphone users. Two years later and out of elementary school, the Xperia E1 has more screen size and brain power to stay afloat in the rough waters of junior high. The good news is the price is still in check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more importantly, this cheap droid is now officially the cool kid. The E1 introduces a new design aesthetic to the bottom of the Xperia line with a sporty outfit and almost rugged look and feel (but not function). Once again, Sony looks back for inspiration and Walkman gets the nod to sex up the company's entry-level lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated button at the top will launch the Walkman app even off the lockscreen to let you play and share music locally and online. The loudspeaker is said to output up to 100db, which may as well put sodcasting at a historic high - not if you're on the receiving end, that is. Anyway, xLOUD, ClearAudio+ and ClearBass are by no means exclusive to the E1 - we'll see about it in our dedicated test. Before we get there though, here's the rest of the Sony Xperia E1's key specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has a convincing package on paper and one that promises a loud bang for your buck. The dual-core Snapdragon 200 chipset from Qualcomm should be able to handle Android 4.3 Jelly Bean trouble-free, definitely making a difference from the single-core CPU inside the original Xperia E. The bigger screen diagonal has been matched by an increase in resolution - for a noticeable, but still affordable, bump in pixel density. There's a bigger battery too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Imaging is the only department to not receive upgrades. The Xperia E1 is still stuck with the same 3.15MP fixed-focus camera from two years ago, and the camcorder will do no better than SVGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is going to be marketed as a music-centric phone and Sony may just have a point here. The company's affordable phones have so far been credible enough and the Xperia E1 should be counting on a warm reception as long as there're no nasty surprises. We're on to the design and build right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 ships in a medium-sized box, which carries the standard set of phone accessories. There's a microUSB cable that pairs with a charger, a set of earphones and the usual printouts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia E1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 118 x 62.4 x 12mm, the Xperia E1 isn't that much taller or wider than its predecessor, while packing a .5" larger display. Sony has significantly reduced the bezels and got rid of the capacitive trio of Android controls in favor of on-screen buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, the Xperia E1 is a millimeter thicker, but thanks to the phone's rounded edges, that's not too much of an issue. The subtle inward curve of the original Xperia E is gone, the E1's styling is a lot simpler - clearly taking clues from the Z lineup but somewhat reminiscent of the old Sony Ericsson T series bars too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In every generation of Sony devices, a common design thread runs the entire lineup top to bottom. Although entirely made of plastic, the Xperia E1 shares some of the general aesthetics of the Xperia Z1 Compact - and that's easier said than done, considering the latter is a stunning piece of design blending glass and aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 on the other hand makes do with a sort of hardened plastic that isn't even particularly nice to the touch - being unusually coarse. On the upside, the phone feels incredibly sturdy - almost like a rugged device. There's no such thing of course - the E1 isn't one of Sony's water-proof offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall though, the phone looks better than on the pictures, or than its finish would suggest. Our test unit came in a two-color paint job - white battery cover and accents against black sides and front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said earlier, the phone isn't particularly slim at nearly 3mm thicker than the Z1 Compact. However, it does feel quite pleasant in the hand thanks to the subtly rounded edges. At 120 grams, it's also slightly heavier than its predecessor, but not so much you'd notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the all-plastic build, the Xperia E1 is probably as solidly built as the Z1 Compact, no squeaks or twisting and the battery cover fit tightly in place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Sony Xperia E felt good in hand with its curvy design, but to be fair its 3.5" screen was a bit on the small side. With its 4"display, the Xperia E1 feels just the right size. Yes, it's a tad thicker perhaps than we would've liked, but its smooth edges really help you not feel it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pocketability hasn't been hurt with the growth of the Xperia E1, either. You won't face any difficulties placing the phone in any pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 controls are quite similar to those of the Z1 compact, sans its flaps on the side. Top left at the front, there's a really tiny status LED. This will serve some basic notification purposes whereas the trademark breathing light below the screen will only glow in certain apps like the music player or image gallery, matching the color theme of what you're looking at. More of a design accent than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right of the earpiece are the proximity and ambient light sensors. The Xperia E1 hasn't got a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom right corner below the 4" screen is the main microphone. On the right hand side of the phone there's the volume rocker and below it the signature Xperia power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features just the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Xperia E1 is where you'll spot the dedicated Walkman button. It's quite prominent, almost the size of the volume rocker, with an etched Walkman logo for added style. Next to it is the 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is bare and there's only a small slit to put a nail and lift the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, there's a 3.15MP fixed-focus camera lens with the secondary microphone sitting above it. The Sony and Xperia logos are above the massive speaker grille, which looks really stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the removable back cover, there's a 1750mAh battery (up from 1530mAh in the original Xperia E) and the microSD card slot above it. It's not hot swappable, as the battery gets in the way. The mini-SIM card slot is within the very battery compartment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperie E1 is built around a 4" TFT LCD display of WVGA resolution (480 x 800 pixels) for a pixel density of 233 ppi. That's the most Sony could've given the phone considering the Snapdragon 200 chipset and we have to say it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color reproduction is decent and while the contrast is rather poor, the screen's brightness than the Xperia E's display. Naturally, it's not as sharp as a 720p screen, but you're not being charged for one of those either. Viewing angles are rather mediocre and there's a noticeable color shift when looked at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the sunlight legibility isn't something spectacular. However, thanks to the increased brightness it's somewhat better than the original Xperia E.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were pleasantly surprised from the Xperia E1's battery performance. It's a 1,700mAh Li-Ion unit, which is slightly smaller than what's found in some of the phone's competitors, but it puts up a fight. Talk time is excellent and because the E1's screen isn't very bright, the web browsing time is pretty great, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia E1 managed an endurance rating of 56 hours, which means it'll easily take two days before you need to charge it, if you use it for 1 hours of talking, web browsing and video playing a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia E1 runs on Android 4.3 out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 comes with Android 4.3 out of the box and Sony's proprietary Xperia launcher on top. The most recent Xperia phones are already running Android 4.4 KitKat though. Sony hasn't shed light on its plans to update the E1 to KitKat just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Sony Xperia E1 to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area or using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The widgets in the Xperia E1 do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applying a new theme changes the lockscreen and homescreen wallpaper and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The rightmost pane is special and fires up the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is on, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but they can be swiped out of the way. You can also enable Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. This time around, the toggles are customizable. You can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android task manager is onboard. It lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. Sadly, Sony's "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T aren't present on the Xperia E1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android OS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, all of your multimedia content is saved too, and all system apps such as messaging, call logs, etc. get their data stored safely. Restoring is easy and if you lost something, you can easily bring it back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia E1 gets activated with an upward swipe from a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the Sony Xperia E1 uses the Snapdragon 200 chipset, which is Qualcomm's entry-level chipset for 2013. The MSM8210 in the Xperia E1 is a dual-core CPU, unlike other quad-core variations of the same chipset. The two cores are of the Cortex-A7 variety and they all run at 1.2GHz each. The Snapdragon 200 also includes an Adreno 302 GPU alongside 512MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cortex-A7 cores aren't the best performers out there so we don't expect much from the Snapdragon 200 in the following series of benchmark tests. However, Sony has done a spectacular job at optimizing them for running the Xperia-garnished UI very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let's see how the two Cortex-A7 cores perform under heavy load. Both single-core and multi-core performance is underwhelming, but it's not disastrous by any stretch and in this price range that actually counts as a win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JRGRAPH_EXPANDABLE_VERSION = false; </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 tests the multi-core performance and the Xperia E1 scored close to the bottom, beating the Nokia X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-in-one tests AnTuTu and Quadrant gauge the overall hardware performance, including graphics and RAM bandwidth. The dual-core Cortex-A7 in addition to the low 512MB RAM definitely put the Xperia E1 at a disadvantage here, but it's not too bad. In AnTuTu 4, the E1 manages to beat the Xperia M, which is a pleasant surprise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ran SunSpider and BrowserMark web benchmarks on Chrome, which is the default web browser on the Xperia E1. The Xperia E surprised us most of the time, managing to beat some contenders that are out of its league.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>The dual-core Snapdragon 200 isn't anything exciting in the benchmark tests we ran. However, it managed to run Android 4.3 Jelly Bean on the Xperia E1 quite well. There is some stuttering when trying to run demanding applications, but in everyday usage though, it's more than capable for handling almost anything you throw at it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show up as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contact feature is present alright - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact, visiting their web page or navigating to their home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes. There is also an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 makes and receives call without breaking a sweat. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation. This enables your voice to be loud and clear even in noisy environments. All in all, you'll have an effortless time placing calls with the E1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia E1 automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 scored a mark of Very good on our loudspeaker tests, meaning you aren't all that likely to miss any calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment. Sony even claims that the Xperia E1 is capable of reaching 100dB from its speaker and we're inclined to believe them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, which noticeably made the sound louder, and then with both xLOUD and ClearPhase on, which sacrificed some of the loudness for improved audio quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS. Four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen handle the most common cases - an image, a photo, a doodle (you draw with your finger) and your location. This, however, takes an extra row from the screen, which isn't too big to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts. It supports batch operations and has a Preview pane option in landscape mode - the list of emails goes on the left, the contents of the currently selected email on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't). It's Google's attempt at unifying all of its messaging services and while the initial release has some quirks that need ironing, it looks to be a promising platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia E1 offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is unsurprisingly comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable bilingual word suggestions, symbols on long press, the Google voice typing key and the smiley key. All these options are disabled by default.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geo-tagging info to display photos where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good UI, codec support could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 didn't experience any difficulties playing 720p and 1080p videos. It loaded them pretty swtiftly and that's no surprise considering the hardware that's under the hood. MP4, DivX, X264 and MOV files played without a glitch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that's certainly an option, you lose the Gracenote features - the Movies app always plays videos (or tries to, anyway) with its own player rather than what you've set as system default. We tried BS Player and it worked well with the aforementioned video formats.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The updated Walkman music player, which is present on all 2014-Xperia smartphones is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board as well. It features the Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with some neat tricks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has updated the FM Radio app and as a results it's now more stable than it was on some recent mid-range Xperia smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nicely clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 did decently in our audio quality test, without breaking any records. It produced very good scores when plugged into an active external amplifier and only let its stereo quality slide when we plugged in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response was spot-on for most of the range, the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range were great too and there was no detectable distortion. The volume levels were rather low, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring 3MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can start snapping away or shoot a video without the need to change modes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia E1 camera offers all kinds of features, including HDR mode, Sweep panorama face detection, geo-tagging and touch capture. Scenes and picture effects are available too. The effects split the screen into nine segments and show a live preview of each of the nine effects, but it's a quite laggy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does. You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but it is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Sony Xperia E1 photos is is nothing spectacular as you might expect. The dynamic range is low and the photos are over sharpened. Colors are washed out and the white balance isn't really accurate - it's mostly tends to be on the gray side. We don't expect anything more from a 3MP camera, but it will do for most of the people anyways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available too, helping you bring extra dynamic range to both the shadows and highlight areas of your shot. It captures even less find detail though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 goes into our photo compare tool in the category of 3MP against the Nokia X and we've also thrown in the Motorola Moto X for good measure. The overall detail of the Xperia E1's samples is actually quite nice. Check out more in our dedicated photo quality comparison tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SVGA video is all you get<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite Sony is claiming the Xperia E1 to support 720p video, the phone actually is limited to just SVGA (800 x 600 pixels) recording. On top of that, it manages to do so at just 20 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video bitrate of 2Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 96 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results aren't all that bad, actually. They're definitely better than what we expected, but there's enough fine detail nor a lot of frames, frankly. At just 20fps, the video is noticeably choppy and there is quite a bit of noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the SVGA sample below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a SVGA@20fps sample for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 has quad-band 2G and tri-band 3G connectivity across all regional models. The Xperia E1 is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. There's also a dual SIM variant of the Xperia E1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). There's no NFC connectivity though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity. Sadly, there's no USB on-the-go support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E1 comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, replacing the former LiveWare manager. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or at a preset time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unmatched browsing with Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome runs ono the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony hasn't preloaded a document viewer on the Xperia E1. Don't fret though, as the Play Store is chock full of easy to use options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are also available from within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your phone and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to use Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 also comes with Google+ and Facebook apps out of the box. The Facebook app also has a nice widget that will show you updates on the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What's not to love about well-made affordable smartphones with a distinct feature that's not only marketable but adds character too? We don't mind aggressively priced either. Which the Sony Xperia E1 clearly is. It's built to a budget, but not a lazy copy-paste job of which we've seen enough in the low end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E1 has a no-nonsense kind of hard-plastic finish that may feel a bit rough to the touch, but doesn't collect fingerprints and feels extra sturdy. The 4" LCD display isn't anything special, but its WVGA resolution strikes a good balance between image quality and strain on the GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the Xperia E1 is powered by a Snapdragon 200 chipset with a dual-core Cortex-A7 CPU, Adreno 302 and 512MB of RAM. It's probably the latter that accounts for the less than stellar benchmark results. The actual performance however, and we mean app-loading times and general responsiveness, is more than decent. We hope KitKat will eventually speed things up a little more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's clear that the music department got some special attention. The Xperia E1 can surely make some noise with the xLOUD on and the overall audio quality is quite good. The Walkman button at the top is a cool addition, putting your local collection and online music a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3MP fixed-focus camera is the same as on the last generation and probably the weak point of a device clearly targeted at a young audience. It's basic, slow and doesn't shoot 720p videos. What Sony did well to upgrade is the battery of the Xperia E1. The 1750mAh LI-Ion unit performed admirably in our dedicated test. It gets even better results in STAMINA mode, but that hurts performance as it downclocks the CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, having broken down the package to its parts, time to look at the competition. HTC seems to have given up on truly compact smartphones, their recent entry-level droids starting at 4.3" of screen diagonal. That may actually make sense, considering the growing demand for screen real estate and the fact that even HTC's budget offerings are usually not cheap. The 4.3" Desire 300 packs a 5MP camera, but falls short of 720p videos. The chipset is an old dual-core Snapdragon S4 Play and that's not ideal for a primary phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 300</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another rival from Taiwan is the ASUS ZenPhone 4. Priced at $99 (likely &#x20ac;89 in Europe), this 115gram droid packs a 4" WVGA display, 1.2GHz dual-core CPU on 1GB of RAM and a 5MP still camera. It's reasonably good looking too, but the 1200mAh battery could potentially spell trouble. And finding one at your local retailer can be tricky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Zenfone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking about affordable smartphones, the Motorola Moto G is one of the hottest deals . It's been making a splash all over the world with its solid build, good looks and, of course, price. Its 4.5" 720p display is in an entirely different category but, if you can have it for the same price or just a bit extra, it's definitely the phone to have. That is, if you can live with the very limited user-available storage and no expansion options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's first Android smartphones, the Nokia X and X+ are almost identical, sporting a 4" WVGA screen each, the latter taking advantage of 768MB of RAM against 512MB, which is also what the Xperia E1 has. The chipset is slower on the Nokia offerings though, and the heavily customized Android UI may not be to everyone's liking, but it's really simple to use and the Nokia X isn't too shabby on the outside either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia X &#x2022; Nokia X+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has of course the Lumia 525 on offer too. The Windows Phone running phone packs a 5MP camera with 1GB of RAM and a 4" WVGA IPS display. It's the successor of the bestselling Lumia 520, and intends to keep things this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 525</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it has to be a droid though, and affordable at that, the Sony Xperia E1 should be at or near the top of your shortlist. It's good-looking, decently quick and with solid battery backup. A strong contender in the low-end shouldn't be a surprise coming from the Japanese, a few generations in a row now. And if anyone somehow hasn't noticed so far, Sony has Walkman once again to get their attention.</paragraph>
