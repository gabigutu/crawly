			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a time when 5 inch screens are all the rage, the Galaxy Grand is Samsung's attempt to cater to every possible taste (and budget) when it comes to smartphones. While the Grand doesn't feature the 1080p screen that recent 5" flagships come with, nor the raw horsepower of the Galaxy Note II, it still has sheer size running for it. If you want a big screen at a low price, the Grand is the one to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the big display, the Grand does not have much which sets it apart from other midrange Samsung smartphones running the new SoC provided by Broadcom. Like the just-released Galaxy S II Plus, it features 8GB onboard storage and a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor of the Cortex-A9 variety. RAM is also the same at 1 GB and the 8MP camera capable of fullHD recording probably uses the very same module. Even the screen resolution is on par with those two, so you can simply think of the Galaxy Grand as an enlarged Galaxy S II Plus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Grand at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course, the picture changes completely if dual-SIM support is what you are after as the Galaxy Grand is the only one of the newly unveiled Samsung duo to offer that. The battery upgrade is not to be neglected either, although we'll only know if it translates to actual longer power autonomy when we get a proper review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand is the only lower-midrange smartphone from a top-tier brand to offer a 5" screen alongside Samsung's very rich software package on Android Jelly Bean. It is, after all, a software experience that has been refined extensively over the past several years by the Koreans, and has played a big part in their current dominance of the smartphone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next, we'll take a look at what sets the Grand apart hardware-wise, and how well the 5" screen handles the limited resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9082 Galaxy Grand 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Grand is not the most compact device you can find. At 143.5 x 76.9 x 9.6mm, it isn't the thinnest 5 incher we've seen either, but it does hold decently well in-hand, and we're happy that Samsung managed to keep the thickness below 10mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight-wise, the scales tip at 162g, which is relatively good for a device this size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design takes after the design scheme first introduced with the Galaxy S III, and the large screen size means you'll have a hard time telling the device apart from, say, the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand features a similar paintjob as what you'll see on the other post-Galaxy S III Samsung devices, but it uses a slightly different and somewhat more slippery to the touch plastic. It also doesn't look quite as nice as the Galaxy Note II plastic, so we assume Samsung employed it as some sort of cost-cutting measure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand uses a 5" capacitive touchscreen display of 480 x 800 pixels resolution. One huge knock against stretching such a low resolution along this much screen estate is the pretty low pixel density - 187 ppi to be exact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that there's no special display technology thrown into the mix doesn't speak well for the image quality, either. You won't see the great contrast ratio and good viewing angles which come with AMOLED displays, and the on-screen crispness is a far cry from what you'll find on 5 inchers with fullHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the display leaves something to be desired, especially if being able to spot individual pixels is a deal-breaker. Then again you shouldn't forget that this is a mid-range device and as such it won't be competing with those 1080p monster screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In its own league the Galaxy Grand does quite well offering extra estate to make up for the uninspiring (but not bad) image quality. Some would find that a sweet deal, and Samsung hopes that the rest will turn towards the Galaxy S II duo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls on the Samsung Galaxy Grand take after the same general formula as what you'll find on most Samsung smartphones. Below the screen we find three keys - the capacitive Menu and Back keys on either side of a hardware Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are well sized and spaced to allow comfortable use and the capacitive touch technology makes sure the transition between them and the screen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you can see the earpiece, a couple of sensors and the 2 megapixel front facing camera, which can do video-calls. The duos logo is there to remind you that you can pop in two SIM cards at once, in case you ever forget, and is only present on the I9082 model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone features just the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom are the microUSB port and the mouthpiece. The microUSB port supports MHL, enabling HD video out (up to 1080p) and multi-channel audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Grand we find the volume rocker, while the power/lock key is symmetrically placed across on the right. There's no dedicated camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens, LED flash, and loudspeaker grille are the only things which adorn the back of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel covers the entire phone's back, is a fairly easy remove, and fits tightly in place, no squeaks and wobble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover, you'll find the two SIM compartments, as well as the microSD card slot. Accessing the primary SIM and microSD requires you to remove the 2100 mAh battery, which means hot-swap is out of the question. The secondary SIM (on the dual-SIM I9082 model) is accessed from the bottom right and is hot-swappable, although you still have to remove the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the Galaxy Grand is about what you'd expect from a 5 inch mid-range device. The bezel is a bit too wide and the slippery plastic cause some problems, but if you have large enough hands (or are willing to use both of them most of the time) you will be fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nature UX goes dual-SIM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean out of box, skinned with the latest TouchWiz launcher, dubbed Nature UX. Its user interface is basically identical to that of the Galaxy S III mini and S II Plus, which is hardly a surprise given that the two share the Grand's Android version and screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the obvious benefits to the user experience compared to stock Android, a clearly midrange handset takes advantage of the same premium combination that powers the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" affair and there're ripples accompanied by water-drop sound as you drag your finger. There are a number of additional unlock routines provided also - motion, face and voice among them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're three customizable lockscreen shortcuts, and you can drag one to activate the corresponding app. That there are only three is rather odd since on the Galaxy S III there are five, and it has a smaller (albeit higher resolution) screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits five custom shortcuts. The rightmost one always opens the app drawer, but the other four can be set to any shortcut or even a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is quite feature-rich and offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Bluetooth. You can swipe to the side to get even more: Mobile data, Blocking mode, Power saving and even Multi-Window support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the brightness slider, complete with an automatic mode checkbox. There are also a couple of other useful things like the Settings shortcut in the upper right corner, the time/date to its left and the carrier name at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This being Jelly Bean, you get expandable notifications to get more info. You can expand and collapse them with a two-finger swipe and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer accommodates both app shortcuts and widgets. Unlike stock Android, you cannot move between tabs by swipes - you have to explicitly hit the widget tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets takes some getting used to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes - Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean comes with a selection of widgets, with some custom additions by Samsung. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is available natively in Jelly Bean. Widgets automatically move out of the way when you're reorganizing the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Jelly Bean-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three buttons at the bottom of the list - one to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager, one to launch Google Now and a 'Kill all apps' button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most notably, the dual-SIM interface is what's been added to this particular Galaxy that we haven't seen on most others. It is an interface that we've seen before on previous dual-SIM Galaxy phones, allowing you to select which SIM card you wish to dial numbers from (which displays as a number on the taskbar), as well as which SIM's data service network to use. You can also quickly switch between both SIM cards from the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX on top of Android 4.1 looks great and the Galaxy Grand does pack most of the cool software tricks of its more robust predecessors. It's rare to see a midrange device having most of the flagship's bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And despite the lack of a quad-core chipset, the Galaxy Grand handles the heavy Samsung skin equally well. It didn't choke on heavy live wallpaper either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy S II Plus, we saw Samsung introduce what will likely be used in its future budget and midrange handset lineups. The Grand features the same dual-core 1.2 GHz Broadcom chipset. While both clocked the same as many previous Samsung devices, the architecture is slightly different, so we expect to see slightly different results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BenchmarkPi single-threaded CPU calculations test lands the Grand towards the bottom of the pack, but that's expected against mostly higher clocked processors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Quadrant, the Grand again beats out the Galaxy S II Plus, and falls in just behind the quad-core devices in our test. Both Broadcom-powered devices are miles ahead of the original Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark runs off-screen at 1080p resolution - putting all our tested devices on equal footing. The Broadcom VideoCore IV HW GPU failed to beat the Mali-400MP inside the Galaxy S II, but stayed pretty close to it, nonetheless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the SunSpider and Browsermark benchmarks gave us some great results. Given all the recent Jelly Bean optimizations to the web browser this was almost expected, as the Grand comes just behind the flagship Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock gallery with a pinch of TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand comes with the default Jelly Bean Gallery which, as you'd imagine, has been treated with some additional TouchWiz flair. It opens up in Album view, which is what we're used to seeing. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the bottom of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, as well as customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Grand will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize people automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with SoundAlive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand employs the same TouchWiz-ed music player as other Nature-UX-enabled Galaxy smartphones. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. The company also uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music is sorted into various categories and one of the options, called Music square, is quite similar to the SensMe feature found on some Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and places those tracks on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to skip songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've enabled the Motion gestures, you can mute and pause a track by placing the phone face down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has gradually become one of the best around when it comes to video playback, and the Galaxy Grand is no exception. It offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view shows static video thumbnails (unlike the handset's more powerful siblings, which animate the thumbnails).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Grand does feature Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone with the video on. You can pinch-zoom the video window to adjust its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three view modes for how the video fits the screen (fit to screen, fill screen, 100% resolution). The SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the screen - you can adjust video brightness, Auto play next, play speed, SoundAlive and enable subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand made a good impression when it offered us a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed to act as an antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand comes with an 8MP camera capable of capturing photos at a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. It has an LED flash to assist it in low lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on the Galaxy S III. On the right there's the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - its lets you easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth shortcut always points to Settings. You can also move the icons around to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand has an extensive set of features: touch focus, smile shot, continuous shot, panorama mode and can snap photos during video recording (but at only 720p resolution, basically a frame from the video). What's missing is HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual images taken are good, but lack in dynamic range. We've taken a few side-by-side shots with the Galaxy S III, where you'll see some better developed shadows on the flagship. Dynamic range aside, the camera quality is nearly identical, providing good color rendering and detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From what we can tell at this stage, whether or not you like the Galaxy Grand boils down to your preferences for screen size and your need for a second SIM slot. If you must have a 5 inch screen and you don't want to pay the extra premium for a flagship device or you need a large screen smartphone with two slots, then the Grand makes a strong case for itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind though, that size aside, the display may leave you somewhat wanting. While its image quality is not bad, it's far from top notch either. The contrast is decent if unspectacular, but more importantly, the WVGA resolution gets stretched pretty thin at this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's original foray into the phablet realm, the Galaxy Note, offers all you'll get with the Grand (besides the dual-SIM support), and then some. You larger, crisper Super AMOLED display of 800 x 1280 pixels resolution, which is covered with Gorilla Glass to boot. Keep in mind that the Note, even after all the price cuts, is still notably more expensive than the Galaxy Grand will be at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note N7000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If screen size or dual-SIM support aren't deal-breakers in your book, then the Samsung Galaxy S II is an excellent alternative. It offers almost identical specs as what you'll get from the Grand, and while the screen is smaller at 4.3 inches, it is of the Super AMOLED Plus variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long story short, if you want an ample screen with a solid software package, which has dual-SIM support to boot, the Galaxy Grand and its expected mid-range price point should be a nice money-saving option. If you don't have all the boxes checked or you are looking for more bells and whistles, you might need to keep looking.</paragraph>
