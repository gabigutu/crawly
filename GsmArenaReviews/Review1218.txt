			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's slim and smart, and wears Prada. This little devil is too sexy to hang out with the other droids. It puts on its evening shoes and goes to town. It hates being chased by paparazzi but always turns its better side to the cameras. We'll see what the other droids think about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by other droids we don't mean a certain Armani-clad Samsung Galaxy S. We're talking about some pretty scary dual-core smartphones with massive screens and the latest in connectivity, imaging and entertainment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're looking at the third phone designed by Prada and built by LG. And it's only the first smartphone to come out of this partnership. LG and Prada go back a long way and their latest creation isn't supposed to be just another Android smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Prada kindly supplying the glitz, the thrills are entirely on LG. They've made sure the LG Prada 3.0 gets nothing short of a flagship treatment. Leading the long list of features is a 4.3" NOVA display, which pumps out 800-nits of brightness. There's a 1GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 processor ticking inside and RAM aplenty. An 8MP auto-focus camera and full HD video earn the LG Prada extra points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it seems a no brainer that the audience targeted by the Prada Phone by LG 3.0 couldn?t care less about the nuts and bolts. Chipset, megapixels, nits and mbps belong in the fine print, with all the acronyms. Here's the rest of the fine print anyway, for all of you who think 3.0 is the best sounding part of the phone's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 is all about making an impression and it gets busy right away. We're about to start exploring the handset and - in our usual routine - we'll have to get past the Prada packaging to discover the Android device inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada phone by LG 3.0 oozes elegance but it also packs quite a punch. There's plenty to keep us busy and little chance of anyone getting bored. A warning may be in order though, for geeks like us, who can't tell Saffiano leather from croc skin to save their life. Bear with us through the tour of the exterior. You'll be in familiar territory in no time with our usual benchmarks and tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: small in quantity, great in quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prada Phone by LG 3.0 comes in a black faux leather box, with soft suede padding on the inside for that extra touch of luxury.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside, we find a standard set of accessories. The modular USB cable to be used with a wall charger is gaining popularity. A stylish set of Prada-branded headphones is the only thing that sets the package apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG and Prada haven't bundled any more accessories. There's no carrying pouch, an MHL cable, or even a microSD card. Various accessories are sold separately, including a Prada branded docking cradle, a Bluetooth headset and a range of carrying cases.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Prada 3.0 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 127.5 x 69 x 8.5mm, this is by no means a small device. The Prada phone holds itself with grace and confidence. Some people may find single-handed use problematic but overall, it's quite manageable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 is built for a select few but its minimalist but powerful styling may be appreciated by a wider audience. The phone seeks to set itself apart from the Optimus crowd and does that rather tastefully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the good looks don't come at the expense of solidity. There's a reassuring heft to the LG Prada in the hand. The handset is stylishly slim, with little screen bezel. The Prada outfit really looks tailored to the measurements of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks can be deceptive. Although the body frame appears to be made of metal, it's actually plastic. It's the awesomely good paint job that makes a great impression. The all plastic build however keeps the weight at the acceptable 138 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the 4.3" NOVA display has a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels and 217ppi pixel density. The first time we saw a NOVA display in action was on the LG Black. The 700 nits of brightness did leave a nice impression, but the latest Prada phone is raising the bid to 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is by no means the brightest display in the market, some Nokia screens are already pushing above 1,000 nits. Overall though, the Nova screen on the Prada phone is well above the LCD average. It has more than enough brightness to make up for the not so deep blacks and as a result enjoys commendable contrast ratio. Sunlight legibility is good at medium and high brightness levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Super AMOLED Plus screen could've easily gotten more punch out of the black-and-white color theme, but we're quite happy with what the NOVA display can offer both indoors and outdoors. The WVGA resolution gets stretched a little thin on a 4.3" diagonal but the mostly monochrome interface does well to camouflage the (d)effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we find proximity and light sensors, a 1.3MP front-facing camera for video calling and the PRADA logo proudly letting everyone know what they're dealing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite end of the LG Prada's front has the four standard Android buttons in capacitive fashion. From left to right they are Menu, Home, Back and Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Prada 3.0's top side is a busy place. Every port of the phone and almost all buttons are located here. The power/sleep button glows when you unlock the device, but doesn't do so on a pending notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other button on top is a shutter key, which hardly makes any sense. And if you thought the location is the worst thing that could happen to it, wait for this. It won't launch the camera when the screen is locked. Not to mention, there's no half press. On the other hand, both buttons are easy to locate by touch and solid on press. They're a pretty nice design accent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-between them resides the microUSB port, which has an even greater looking sliding cover with the same brushed metal finish. Finally, on the far left side, is the standard 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Prada features only a microphone. Two studs in each corner mirror the steel buttons on the opposite end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume keys are located on the left side of the LG Prada 3.0. The little plastic knobs are somewhat inconsistent with the styling of the rest of the controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is clean and keeps to the minimalist look of the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone, as usual, features the 8MP camera lens and a LED flash, set within a brushed aluminum plate. There's another Prada label, and an LG logo for a change, which is not nearly as conspicuous. The single speaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe they could've done without a Prada logo at the back because the entire battery cover screams Prada to those who have the ear for it. It has the apparently famous Saffiano pattern, which - no less apparently - is all Italian to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, what's more important is that the leather-like pattern doesn't translate too well into plastic. That's one aspect of the Prada phone's design we're not so sure about aesthetically. On the practical side, it provides a really nice grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals a microSD card slot, a SIM card compartment and a 1540 mAh Li-Ion battery, which LG claim is good for 330 hours of standby. You should get 5h of talks in a 3G network, but unfortunately we can't confirm those claims because of the short time we got with the LG Prada 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solid build and strong design language will probably win this phone lots of fans beyond the fashion-conscious crowd. We liked the subtle, but strong accents and the stately elegance of a 4.3" Android smartphone that means business. It takes a real connoisseur though to appreciate the Saffiano back. Maybe that's why we didn't. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada phone by LG 3.0 has a trustworthy build and a reassuring feel in hand. We think it does just fine without metal on the body. We just couldn't help but wonder what an AMOLED screen might've been like. Now, let's hope the Prada phone won't leave us wanting more in the software department.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android gone black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The previous two Prada phones used the LG's proprietary uses interface, but it's been always painted in black and white. The third Prada phone is based on Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread, skinned with LG's own theme we've already met within the Optimus Black. Quite expectedly the theme is done in black and white as well so it matches the Prada style established over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are familiar with the Android Gingerbread OS, you'll at home from the very beginning - there is nothing really different in functionality, just the appeal - the UI got new icons, fonts and backgrounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue with our thorough software review, you should find helpful the demo video we made for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see LG has put no efforts trying to hide the pure Android, it just tried to make the OS unique. Frankly, LG has succeeded quite well doing this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of screen, which are visible across the homescreen panes and the app drawer. The default docked icons are Phone, Contacts, Messaging, Applications but you can reassign or rearrange the first three anytime, just tap&amp;hold on the icon you want to change/move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The view mode similar to the HTC Sense leap view is also present: you can zoom out with a pinch gesture to see all the available homescreen panes in one place. You can also change the default homescreen from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of homescreen panes can be anything from 1 to 7. The way you place stuff on the homescreen has a twist too. Upon a tap and hold on the display - or by hitting the add button in the menu - gridlines appear on the screen and the four docked icons get replaced by a taskbar with widgets, shortcuts, folders and wallpapers to choose from. Thanks to the Gesture support (if you've enabled it from Settings), once you've selected an item to add you can select the homescreen to place it on by simply tilting the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gesture support is quite poor compared with the one on the Optimus Black, but still it does things that lots of droids lack - turn-to-mute, turn-to-snooze, turn-to-pause (video player) and the already mentioned tilt to switch panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is also interesting. It has two different layouts to choose from - category and page. The Page view is quite common among the droid gang and holds nothing special. The Category (list) view is the special one. The default categories are Applications and Downloads but you can add new ones as needed. You can collapse/expand categories with a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, has five switches - Sound, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC and Sync. There are also music player controls docked here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen customization is the same as previous LG droids - you can add widgets, shortcuts, folders or change the wallpaper with live or static one. All the widgets and icons have been skinned with the black Prada theme, but nothing beyond that has changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the UI color scheme is black and white, LG has come up with something interesting so you can keep everything with this style - you can choose different icons for the shortcuts you place on the homescreens - just like in the desktop Windows OS. So, let's say you put the greenish Market icon on the homescreen. Tap and hold on it and a small paintbrush appears. Now you can choose a new icon for the app. There are lots of icons to choose from, though they can never be enough. Still this solution is a lot better than nothing at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new thing we noticed on the LG Prada 3.0 - Scenes. They are exactly the same as the HTC Sense's Scenes - offer a predefined homescreen with widgets and shortcuts depending on the occasion - work, travel, play, etc. You can create own Scenes as well. It's not the best feature we would choose to copy from HTC, but nevertheless some people will find that useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nice handy feature available throughout all lists with alphabet scrolling available - pinch to collapse. For example with a single pinch gesture you can collapse the whole main menu, phonebook, music player, etc. into alphabetic bars - then you have to tap on each bar to reveal its contents or expand them all with the opposite pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a task manager on board as well (called App Manager), with a small dedicated widget on the homescreen. You can access it from the widget, the main menu or from the shortcut from the Android task switcher (tap and hold on the Home key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we said pretty much everything about the Prada 3.0 user interface - it's the same ol' Gingerbread with a new black look. Thanks to the powerful hardware the UI is fast, responsive, with no lags or whatsoever. If for some reason you want to free some used RAM, you can do it via the App Manager (from the main menu or the dedicated widget).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We said the UI is snappy, but nothing speaks better than a few benchmarks. So, we did what we usually do - put the Prada 3.0 through the BenchmarkPi, Linpack, NenaMark and the two browser test - SunSpider and BrowserMark. The new Prada did well, but nothing impressive scoring average or above average results on the CPU and graphic benchmarks, but a bit low on the browser tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A familiar phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is the same we met on the Optimus Black, but as the rest of the system apps, it got the new black look too. It displays all the contacts in a list ordered alphabetically and there is an alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phone book from getting overcrowded - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is displayed with a contact photo and name - a tap on the photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use those to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single contact uses a tabbed interface. The first tab is Info - and it shows all available info for the contact with handy one-tap shortcuts for calling, messaging and so on. The next tab is History, which shows the communication history with the contact (calls, SNS updates, everything). The third tab is Photos - it holds the contacts online albums. The final Agenda tab shows all the events concerning this particular contact (meetings, anniversaries, reminders, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "join" contacts so that if you have a contact added to multiple services, all the data from them is pooled in one place. When you tap Join, the phonebook will suggest a contact based on name and it's right most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manually pick another one if it's wrong of course. When you add a new account, the phone will offer to import all, only some of the contacts or only those it already has in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Prada 3.0 showed good signal reception even in areas of poor coverage. The in-call quality is good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Prada 3.0. Scoring a Good result, you can bet you won't be missing many calls with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts. If you do add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy. Too bad there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboard input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which feature both portrait and landscape typing. As the rest of the UI, the keyboard also uses the Prada black and white color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard looks a little iPhone-like but it's good nonetheless. Portrait mode is accurate enough (though we would get a typo on occasion) for text input and the landscape mode makes things even better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery has no changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It also boasts cool 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view. In grid view, there's a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available but you can also use double tap or even the +/- virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture - you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Email apps, SmartShate app or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays the images in full resolution unlike many droids. Zooming and panning is fast and smooth and there's absolutely no lag in doing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music looks familiar but got the new black and white treatment as well. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its side reveals a cool 3D wall of all the albums you have in your music collection. Tap on an album and you'll see a list of all songs from it. There's an alphabet scroll at the bottom of the screen to make finding albums faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip a song or go back to the previous one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a menu to search - for the title, the artist or the album title. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets available including a Virtual surround option, which works even without headphones, but the effect doesn't do much without them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also when you're playing a song it gets displayed in the notification area. You can also pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio, but no RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you get tired of your music collection, there's an FM radio in the LG Prada 3.0. It can play over the headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna). There is no RDS support though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>One of the best video players up to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface - it's just a list of all the videos on the devices. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can of course play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either - there's the scrubber (you can change it to a thumbnail bar) to skip to some part of the video along with the play/pause button and next and previous buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more buttons are available on the screen - one toggles cropping (i.e. fit video to screen, or crop it to fill the entire screen) and the other activates the Virtual surround.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 handled just about every video file we threw at it - the usual 3GP and MP4 stuff along with MKV, WMV and AVIs using DivX and XviD. All 1080p videos we threw at it were not a problem either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles worked fine too, with settings for color, font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there's no option to manually point to a subtitles file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename. We tried a few type of non-English and non-Latin subtitles and they were all handled properly. Good job, LG!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is great for the most part<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 is a high-end smartphone and as such it would have no excuse, had it failed to impress in our audio quality test. Luckily that wasn't the case and the fashion-minded device did quite well in most parts of the test. It's not the best we have seen, but it's good enough for everybody, but the most demanding audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the LG Prada 3.0 got some pretty impressive scores for dynamic range, distortion levels, stereo crosstalk and signal-to-noise ratio. Its frequency response is spot on for the most part with only a small drop to be noticed in the extremely high frequencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most unpleasant effect of connecting a pair of headphones to the Prada 3.0 is the huge increase in stereo crosstalk. Its really among the worst performances we have seen in that aspect, but the rest of the readings remain great, so overall it's not too terrible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 8 megapixel sharpshooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Prada 3.0 comes with an 8 megapixel shooter, capable of capturing 3264 x 2448 resolution images. There is a single LED flash, but it won't be of much help in most of the low-light scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the user interface to be quite convenient, though many of the important settings are inside the extended settings menu, so they take a while to toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The oddest thing we found was the hardware camera key placement - on top of the device, near the 3.5mm audio jack. It can't even start the camera when the phone is locked, so we find no real purpose of it. Why LG has put this thing here, we really have no idea. We strongly recommend using the virtual shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features are limited to geo-tagging, ISO setting, preset scenes and shot mode (normal, continuous shot or panorama). Face detection and continuous autofocus are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the third Prada scores among the best in the 8MP league. The produced photos have plenty of detail, good contrast and accurate colors, and no defects whatsoever. The only thing we noticed is the higher than usual noise levels, but we guess it's either the high amount resolved detail - high noise levels combo or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few shots we've taken with the LG Prada 3.0.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the photos from the LG Prada 3.0 are among the best 8MP performers in our chart tests. The Apple iPhone 4S did a tad better, but the Prada 3.0 still does greater than most 8MP droids out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Interlaced 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prada 3.0 is among the smartphones, capable of capturing 1080p videos at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder UI is basically unchanged from the camera one. In terms of options you can choose the resolution of the video, white balance, video quality and audio recording on/off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording got us by surprise. Despite the bad weather, the Prada 3.0 shot nice 1080p and 720p videos, without any dropper frames, defects or artifacts. The amount of resolved details is very good, the colors and contrast are almost perfect and probably better than most of the smartphones could handle in those weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately we noticed the videos Prada 3.0 is capturing are interlaced - the 1080p is actually 1080i (1920x540 real resolution) and same for the 720p videos. Don't get this wrong - the videos still look excellent, but those with a lot horizontal detail won't be as good as others - like the resolution chart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing someone might not like is the mono AAC audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a 720p and 1080p videos we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to switch to 1080p for the sample below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The comparison tool proves the Prada 3.0 videos are very good, though the resolution chart fails because of the interlaced capturing mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 comes with a big range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and three-band HSDPA with 21 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload speeds (hypothetical ones). There's also dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities. There is Bluetooth 3.0 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone on another device (e.g. DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct is a technology which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty in it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready in order for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the inevitable Bluetooth demise. This is something we've seen before with the replacement of the infrared technology for the Bluetooth one and now it seems bound to happen with Wi-Fi Direct becoming widespread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board. There is a dedicated NFC app from where you can create, read and send NFC tags. You can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no HDMI port on the Prada 3.0, instead you have to use the MHL USB port for HDMI output. Of course you need to buy the appropriate accessory first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Prada.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device - put it on a beautiful screen, like the Prada's 4.3 NOVA one and it provides flawless experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalistic (it's the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar on top and a control bar at the bottom (with hide options). The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, windows shortcut, add new window and the hide key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada 3.0 browser offers a handy option to bookmark a page in a quick section called Read it later. If you choose a website to go in Read it later, you can then open it from the Read later section and it will disappear from the list. The thing works just like the bookmarks, but remove the bookmark after you've opened it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RSS, text selection and find on page are also available from the advanced menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada 3.0 supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've zoomed in using pinch zoom, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a "most visited" list in addition to the history and the Read it later section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole browsing experience is excellent - there's almost no lagging and the 4.3" WVGA screen offers plenty of room even for complex web pages. Text remains crisp regardless of zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada 3.0 browser is Flash-enabled and everything ran very smoothly - from desktop (720p) YouTube (and other video sharing sites) to touch-oriented Flash games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there's a preloaded document viewer and editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it's one of the most feature advanced mobile editors we've seen. You can of course view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app - it's better than the other mobile editors we've tested, even better than the Windows Phone 7 one (which had many editing limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rich Note app allows you to take notes and add media to them (images, audio, location). It supports drawing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also weather, news and finance apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Image Editor is also pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Desk Home and Car Home apps are here as well. The first one speaks for itself - it offers a nice flipping watch, gallery slideshow and calendar, while the Car Home has a bunch of useful shortcuts in case you dock the phone in your car.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated Facebook, Twitter or MySpace apps. Instead you get the Social+ widget, which properly configured handles all your social networks. It displays all the latest news feeds, allows you to update your status (you can add media and links), you can also read your messages and handle friend request - all within this widget. In case you need more, you will be redirected to the mobile web version of the appropriate social service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always download the official Facebook and Twitter apps from the Android Market too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 has the latest version of the Android Market. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld own app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps - there you can find lots of free content and promotions exclusive for the LG users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation (where available)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 3.0 managed to get a GPS lock in about two minutes without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fashion phones are usually not the easiest around to recommend. And we guess we're way past the point of spoilers, so there it is. We liked the Prada phone by LG 3.0. This isn't about whether or not we'd put in a good word for this phone - it's who to recommend it to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How well the previous two did on the market is beside the point. We're not sure about the Prada-wearing QWERTY messenger, but the original Prada phone by LG was very popular, and deservedly so. This time around, there seems to be too much complication. Now, how much is too much? The problem with this phone is it's too smart for the job. And not smart in the French or Italian sense. It's the Android vernacular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People buying the Prada phone by LG 3.0 are more likely to be interested in a Prada Bluetooth headset and a Prada leather pouch than in getting an advanced task killer off the Android market. And they'd probably turn down an ice-cream sandwich in favor of Stracciatella gelato.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From where we stand, the Prada phone's biggest problem is credibility. You may as well be buying the dual-core processor and the 800-nit 4.3" Nova display. Good luck telling people not to look at the logo. Prada will be all they see. Even we find it hard to believe that this, of all droid handsets, is such a good cameraphone. Trust us, it is. It's shockingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it's a reasonably powered smartphone, a great cameraphone and a fashion phone. You'd expect the combo to cost a small fortune. But guess what -- it doesn't. More than ?500 at launch is a hefty price tag but not that far away from its Android competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are more sensible buys at this point. You'd be saving quite a handful on a Samsung Galaxy S II or the super-slim Motorola DROID RAZR. The latter is based on the same chipset as the Prada 3.0, but the CPU is clocked higher at 1.2GHz. It flaunts an AMOLED screen and ups the resolution to qHD. The Samsung Galaxy S II hardly needs much introduction. You'd be getting one of last year's top phones - one that can give a lot of recent flagships a run for their money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II ? Motorola RAZR XT910</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XE is another possible alternative running on the widely popular Qualcomm MSM8260 Snapdragon chipset with a 1.5GHz dual-core processor. The bundled Beats headset and the eye-candy Sense UI are points in favor, but it loses badly in the imaging department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation XE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony's latest Xperia S should be released in a few weeks and will cost nearly the same as the Prada. It's quite the looker too and isn't underpowered at all with the same 1.5GHz dual-core chipset as the Sensation XE. It's keen to top that up with a 12 megapixel camera and an impressive HD Reality display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The question isn't though which Android smartphones make a viable option for the Prada phone. As we already said, the Prada 3.0 doesn't belong with the other droids. And no, that doesn't make the iPhone 4S the most relevant alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're very few like the Prada phone by LG 3.0. The Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani is one of them. We liked it a lot but didn't feel optimistic about its prospects. The LG Jil Sander Mobile is a more recent example - and it doesn't seem to have taken off at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani ? LG Jil Sander Mobile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phones like these are a gamble. Never as much as today, with smartphones really taking over. No wonder we haven't heard anything about Nokia and their Arte series lately. Smartphone or a designer phone isn't a meaningful choice. Whatever people's reason for buying the Prada phone by LG 3.0, half of the phone will be wasted. The way we see it, the smartphone half will be wasted more often than the fashion phone half. And if you think you can balance them, you'd be one happy customer.</paragraph>
