			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are so many of them that it?s pretty hard to make up your mind. It all boils down to LCD vs. LED although this simple fact is easy to overlook. You can go ahead and blame it all on marketing but that?s one thing that just can?t be black and white. Instead of keeping it simple, manufacturers are busy making up catchy names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Had enough with LCD? Be our guest, try Super LCD. There?s even Super Clear LCD for the sake of being different. Same with AMOLED. There?s the garden variety. But there?s also Clear Black and Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with so many screens around even we got mixed up. And instead of writing down ?We?ll never again mistake regular LCD for Super LCD? three thousand times, we got assigned to do this article. Yes sir. Coming up, boss. It?s about LCD and AMOLED, about Super AMOLED and SUPER LCD. It?s about the Retina display, which technically is a type of LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not a story going back to monochrome displays and the dawn of STN and CSTN screens. That would?ve made an even bigger mess. Instead, we?re focusing on present day touchscreen and the varieties it comes in. We have each technology represented and it?s quite a bunch of highly popular and fairly recent phones being judged by the quality of their screen. From the good old LCD to the ClearBlack AMOLED by Nokia ? they are all here, with all their strengths and weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the contenders, along with the display technology they stand for. In the LCD corner, the HTC Desire HD and LG Optimus 7 are next to the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Desire HD ? LG Optimus 7 ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II is on the enhanced LCD team ? technically, it?s Super Clear LCD, the brand name Samsung use to market their own SLCD-based screens. The Retina display is not just another LCD screen either ? like the Apple iPhone 4 is not just another phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Samsung S8530 Wave II ? Apple iPhone 4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 is running for AMOLED, while the C6-01 has Nokia?s ClearBlack technology behind it. Finally, we have a couple of Super AMOLED screens ? on the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S and Samsung S8500 Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N8 ? Nokia C6-01 ? Samsung I9000 Galaxy S ? Samsung S8500 Wave</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An elite club it is and that goes to show how important screens are. Manufacturers can?t go on for ever offering more and more features, so things like screen quality are becoming a key selling point.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>How we tested<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran each of the participants against the following checklist, hoping to make it easier for you to choose your next phone based on the type of screen it has:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality ? the most important aspect of screen performance. The contrast levels can make all the difference in the world but brightness and accurate colors are quite important too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility and overall reflectivity determine the extent to which the display performance deteriorates in the bright sun. Not too long ago some handsets were near impossible to use outdoors and while improvement has been noted, there is still some difference between the best and the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles is about being able to see what?s on your handset?s screen even if you aren?t looking at it straight on. For example, sharing what?s on-screen with a friend might be impossible with a handset with narrow viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course other aspects of actual phone use will also be mentioned (ambient-light sensor, proneness to smudges), but those three matter the most and will understandably get most of the attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot each of the contestants from different angles in three different setups: complete darkness, artificial (indoors) and natural lighting (outdoors). The first one should reveal the full potential of each display, while the other two give an indication of their real-life performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give all phones equal chance we went for single shots where each handset was placed in the exact same position and we used exactly the same camera settings. We did that, because shooting them together would have put the ones farthest from the camera lens at a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the two Nokia handsets have an ambient light sensor, which automatically sets the display brightness. Even at the maximum brightness setting, the sensor always has the final say and that?s why they look darker (mostly the N8) than most competitors in the completely dark setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When taken outdoors they switched back to higher brightness levels so just keep in mind that the dark shots are not indicative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the best performers grouped by category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is certainly among the most important parts of a display's performance. Deep blacks is what everyone wants to see and if the darkest you handset can show is grayish everything on the screen will look as if the screen is covered by white film.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screens to give the best performance here Samsung Galaxy S Super AMOLED and Nokia's ClearBlack AMOLED. Those two technologies are capable of showing noticeably deeper blacks than anything else on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other AMOLED screen, the Nokia N8 comes up next, confirming the technology dominance in this aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4's Retina is the best LCD can offer and the only thing that at least comes somewhat close to AMOLED. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the group are way behind, the Super Clear LCD, slotting in sixth and the regular LCD trio completing the tally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 4's non-reflective screen helps it move a step closer to the top when faced with very bright light sources. It manages to just edge out the Super AMOLEDs and is tied with the ClearBlack screen for the first place here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the difference might not be visible in real life scenarios, the two Samsungs - S8500 Wave and I9000 Galaxy have to settle for the third spot here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N8 is legible enough in bright sun to get the fifth position, though its lead over sixth-placed Super Clear LCD isn't huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And once again it's good ol' LCDs at the foot of the class. The XPERIA X10 does best of the three LCD-equipped handsets, but that is still good enough for a seventh place only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two spots are occupied by the HTC Desire HD and LG E900 Optimus 7, which have some usability issues when taken outdoors.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Color rendition</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendition is quite important for image quality as it can make the difference between a good but unimpressive display and a real eye-popper. Notice that it's not all about the accuracy here - it's more about the phone producing colors that are pleasing to the eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leader here is Nokia C6-01, which produces the best colors in our view. It finds the best balance between natural look and punch, just edging out the two Super AMOLEDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 with its regular AMOLED shares nicks the bronze medal, right under the iPhone 4's nose. Both of those could use a little extra color saturation if they are to match the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II, Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and the HTC Desire HD come up next - their results aren't too bad, but they are nothing to write home about either. Of course it has more to do with the screen limitation than with decisions made by their designers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 finishes last here, which comes to show what happens when you disregard those limitations and push the saturation to the maximum. Colors are so over-saturated that there's even loss of detail at some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly much to explain here - the wider the viewing angles the less you need to hold the display directly facing you in order to enjoy its brilliance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first place here is a three-way tie between the IPS LCD of the iPhone 4 and the two Super AMOLEDs produced by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 comes up next and in real-life scenarios you probably won't notice the difference between it and the leader. The same holds true for the Nokia N8, which comes up just behind its sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super Clear LCD of the Wave II only manages sixth place, losing color way below its competitors we mentioned above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while it might not sound much for a brand new technology it's still way better than the regular LCDs, which are once again lagging behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More pixels mean sharper images and more space for content on the screen. Depending on your eyesight and the distance between your eyes and your phone increasing the resolution becomes pointless (i.e. you cannot actually see the difference) but having too many pixels is never an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The undisputed champion here is the iPhone 4 with its 960 x 640 pixels screen. It leads the second best (Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10) by just over 33% and boasts an incredible pixel density of 326 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a huge crowd in third place with five of the contestants sporting WVGA resolution (800 x 480 pixels). We still find WVGA good enough for almost all purposes, even though it has just 62.5% of the resolution of the leader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only two units to actually lose here are the Symbian^3-capped Nokia C6-01 and Nokia N8. The so-called nHD (360 x 640 pixels) might be good enough so that it's not bothering, but it's not as impressively sharp as we would have liked. At just over a third (37.5%) of the Retina resolution it just cannot come near to the print-like look that the iPhone 4 screen has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 30 Nov: Okay we saw there is a storm brewing in the comments section so we decided to step up and clear this out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a few extremely close-ups, demonstrating what this is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily see that the Samsung S8530 Wave II renders very fine detail better and thus has some sharpness advantage over the Galaxy S. This is mostly pronounced with images that are predominantly blue or red. However keep in mind that the image you are seeing is magnified about 25 times depending on your monitor resolution and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life the difference is quite minor and only visible after careful observation of two handsets placed side by side. We would advise against basing your final decision on it, except in cases of a perfect tie.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LCD (HTC Desire HD, LG E900 Optimus 7, Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s nothing particularly special about the LCD screens on the HTC Desire HD, the LG E900 Optimus 7 and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. The technology has been around for ages and we didn?t have huge expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LCD screens are capable of decent contrast at most and that?s not much by today?s standards. In this particular test those three displays were last and by some distance at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not nearly as bad when we look at brightness levels, though. In fact, the 4 incher on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 was probably the brightest screen of the bunch. The Optimus 7 and Desire HD weren?t quite as impressive, but no worse than the middle of the pack either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the sunlight legibility is concerned, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 was the best of the trio, the E900 Optimus 7 coming up last. This is yet another area where LCD cannot really match the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall reflectivity of the screens is part of the explanation for their average contrast, though it?s by far not the only problem. You see, LCD displays always have the backlighting on (otherwise the screen will switch off altogether). So if black needs to be displayed their best shot is to try and block as much of the light as possible and that?s not really leading to perfect results. Black is a darker shade of grey at best. LEDs on the other hand can be turned off, meaning that true black is attainable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we come to viewing angles, which we are afraid are another questionable part of the LCD performance. The contrast quickly degrades as you tilt the handsets to a wider angle and at extremes it is hard to even make out what?s on the screen. The overall effect varies across different devices but we haven?t seen an LCD screen that could possibly challenge the best in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we feel that a particular flaw of the LG Optimus 7 display needs to be mentioned here. The handset tends to over-saturate images and that?s more prominent than on any other phone in our sample. Topped with the less than stellar contrast, it results in an inevitable loss of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, regular LCD fails to offer mind-blowing image quality. LCD screens just can?t rival newer technologies in pure performance and their energy efficiency is inferior too. Those screens are still the cheapest to produce and their time is not over yet. It may be time however they stepped down from the high-end smartphone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to make a recommendation, we?d be split between the XPERIA X10 for its higher resolution and better sunlight legibility and the Desire HD for its bigger size and slightly better viewing angles. The LG Optimus 7 unit comes last within its own league and the overall standing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So classic LCD didn?t quite make it. Now let?s see how regular AMOLED fares with the N8 screen coming up next.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AMOLED (Nokia N8)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today?s first AMOLED screen has no super powers and hence, no fancy name. The Nokia N8 was announced before the Nokia ClearBlack technology was available. The Nseries flagship has a regular AMOLED screen .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Light-emitting diodes are the very source of backlighting on AMOLED screens. As opposed to LCD, each pixel can be switched off individually and thus real black colors can be displayed instead of different shades of gray. That?s why AMOLEDs can offer much better contrast than any LCD currently on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are pretty good and you can see what?s on the screen with almost no color fading. It might not be as good as the iPhone but the differences are mostly in those extreme cases that rarely (if ever) occur in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the brightness levels of this type of screens are not particularly impressive. That explains the loss of contrast when taken outside. The effect is even noticeable under bright lights indoors, though in this case it still remains better than the handsets we checked so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t get us wrong ? the Nokia N8 display is still perfectly legible in the sun and you can easily find an angle to work with the handset. It?s just that the colors do get a bit washed out, which makes the screen a lot less impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we need to mention the ambient light sensor, which users just cannot override. You can control its brightness range, but the sensor always has the last say. It means that you cannot use the maximum brightness level in absolute darkness or set it to minimum in bright light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, we need to remind you that this is also the reason why the N8?s screen looks so much dimmer than the other handsets in the dark shots ? we just couldn?t override the ambient sensor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>IPS LCD/Retina display (Apple iPhone 4)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple want to make you believe that the iPhone 4?s Retina display is a new technology altogether, but the truth is it?s not much more than an LCD with some tweaks. The good news is those tweaks actually work and the performance boost is well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all starts with the nearly non-reflective surface. Indeed, the iPhone 4 is our sunlight legibility champion: the outdoor image quality virtually impossible to distinguish from the one inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of reflection (or the lack thereof in this case) does have an effect on the indoor performance too. While the actual contrast of the iPhone 4 just can?t be far greater than that of some other LCDs, its perceived contrast (which is what matters really) looks much more acceptable. The difference isn?t noticeable when you use the handset in complete darkness, but in all other cases the iPhone 4?s blacks are deeper than any other LCDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we are saying is it?s not so much that the Retina has vastly superior potential, it?s just that Apple are using the LCD capabilities to the fullest. Unfortunately, those capabilities are severely limited compared to AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no such limitations with the viewing angles however and they are simply out of this world with the iPhone 4. The IPS technology makes sure there is hardly an angle wide enough to make the Retina lose its brilliance . Neither contrast lowers nor colors get washed out even when looking from the very side of the device (it's that good!). It?s almost as if you?re looking at printed paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Retina screen earns some extra points for its fingerprint resistant surface and ambient light sensor. Of course the iPhone 4 will eventually get greasy with use but it still takes twice the time compared to most competitors. And it is the only device that gives you a choice between manual and automatic brightness control and a way to control the automatic mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all in all, the Retina display is the pinnacle of LCD evolution ? it wrings every bit of potential out of this technology. And it certainly is your only option if you are looking for the highest possible resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Super Clear LCD (Samsung S8530 Wave II)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Manufacturers will gladly have you believe the main point of Super LCD is to vastly improve regular LCD. In fact, Super LCD screens are a much-hyped Plan B. Super LCD is a fix for the AMOLED shortage that caused makers to reorganize their supply and production.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC was forced to switch from AMOLED to S-LCD for some of its Android smartphones like the Desire and the Nexus One. Even Samsung had no choice but replace the Super AMOLED flagship of their own Bada smartphone platform with a device with an S-LCD-based screen. Now, they call it Super Clear LCD, but we guess that?s mostly marketing talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, we were a bit disappointed with the Samsung S8530 Wave II display. Its contrast is a bit better than common LCD but still behind the AMOLED competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels on the other hand are excellent and, combined with the low screen reflexivity, make the device excellent to use outdoors. Indeed, the sunlight legibility is probably the most significant improvement that S-LCD has brought. Super LCD screens are nearly on par with the best examples on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles have also been widened, though - again - the upgrade isn?t that great. Color rendering isn?t quite precise either, with a distinct bluish cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as usual, the truth lies somewhere in between. In short, S-LCD is a notable step up from regular LCD, but still far from the top of the food chain.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ClearBlack AMOLED (Nokia C6-01)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve come to the first representative of Nokia?s new ClearBlack technology. The invention of the Finns is not about the display itself. It?s the glass over it, which is said to act like a polarizing filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may sound like just another gimmick but its real life benefits are huge. We for one, were pretty impressed with the Nokia C6-01 screen. With reflections reduced even further compared to the N8 you get to experience the full potential of the underlying AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That means you get to enjoy the highest contrast in the industry (Clear Blacks share the lead with Super AMOLED). Artificial lighting no longer takes its toll on the contrast and even the bright sun has negligible effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are comparable to the best and the impressive color balance (a hard one to pull off on AMOLED) rounds off a thoroughly impressive overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ambient light sensor is still impossible to override and that?s basically all we can hold against this display. Well that and the resolution, but resolution is limited by the OS and not by the technology so it shouldn?t count here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Super AMOLED (Samsung S8500 Wave, Samsung I9000 Galaxy S)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve already discussed Super AMOLED screens on numerous occasions and have had no reason to doubt their quality. The Samsung S8500 Wave was the first to impress us, but the I9000 Galaxy S and the Omnia 7 didn?t disappoint either. The question is how good Super AMOLED is compared directly to all the other technologies that appeared after it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, the contrast is still that good. We just told you that it shares the first place with the Nokia CBD unit, that takes an edge over regular AMOLED on the N8 due to its lower reflectivity and runs circles around any LCD screen you can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are as good as those of the iPhone 4. Extremely subtle differences can be observed when the two handsets are placed side by side but we don?t really think anyone will note them in real life use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is near perfect, only the tiniest of bits worse than the best (again, iPhone 4). You can still enjoy those deep blacks in the bright sun and that is a huge win for the Super AMOLED. You see, even if it loses a bit more contrast than the Apple Retina its starting point is so high that you are still left with excellent results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendition is very pleasing on both Super AMOLED units. Applied saturation is just enough to make everything on the screen look pleasing, without going into extremes. The only problem we noticed was the slight green tint that both units we used for the review had. If you really need perfect color rendering, you might need to pass on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are just looking for pleasantly looking tones however, Super AMOLED is an excellent performer ? and you should also take into account its energy efficiency.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wrap up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With most of the review already behind us, we have only managed to tell you half the story so far. Display technology is important for making the right choice but in the end you have to consider more than just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are different resolutions and screen sizes and - of course - the feature sets count too. While you can find an LCD screen of pretty much any size and resolution, you only have two options for Super AMOLED and just one for the Retina.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cheat sheet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a brief summary of our findings for the time of creation of this article. We wouldn't advise you to base your decision only on the ratings in it, but it could be used as a quick reference after you've read the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also check out those collages we prepared for you so you can compare the handsets for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end it all depends on what you use the phone - and the screen - for. The I9000 Galaxy S seems to be the best performer overall, but don't hesitate to go for an iPhone 4 if you need more resolution for those web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is really going the right way with its CBD technology too - it's just a matter of time before they lift that resolution cap and start using it to its fullest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if don?t really care about image quality all that much... Well, grab yourself an LCD and save some cash to spend on apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only technology that has a long way to go to convince skeptics (us included) is S-LCD. It?s just too insignificant of an update for the price premium and the time it took to appear. It will need to boost its credentials and shed its image of an emergency cure for the AMOLED shortage. At least, Apple?s Retina display has shown it?s not all lost for LCDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the future is with AMOLED, it?s not all rosy for them right now either. They offer excellent image quality and lower energy consumption ? that should be enough to make them the definitive choice. But the negative effect of the present AMOLED shortage will be felt for some time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One possible outcome is that AMOLED screens could become even more desirable. Phones like the Samsung Galaxy S and Omnia 7 will get a major boost being the lucky few to sport a Super AMOLED screen. It?s curious to see what happens to Nokia?s CBD ? the Clear Black coating is theirs but they still need to ensure continuous supply of AMOLED units.</paragraph>
