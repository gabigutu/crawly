			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>IFA 2014 is now well under way and it welcomes all brands, big and small. Similarly, every gadget gets its 15 minutes and we'll try to cover all of them. The ones that don't get their own article go here but this doesn't take anything away from them, there are plenty of interesting things to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer was the company that kicked things off in Wednesday and it unveiled (among other things) a couple of smartphones - the Liquid Jade and the Liquid Z500. The Jade is the more premium device of the two while the Z500 aims at the mass-market with a ?150 price tag.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer will be releasing the Liquid Jade in Europe as well. It's a super lightweight mid-range offering with a 5" HD display. The phone weighs just 110g and feels really thin thanks to its clever design. It measures 7.5mm thick, but makes an impression of a much slimmer device due to its tapered edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is an IPS HD unit with okay viewing angles. It's quite bright, but colors looked a bit washed out. The lightning at the IFA venue is to blame perhaps, but it was also quite reflective. On a positive note, the bezels are really thin and help the phone look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood, there's a quad-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 CPU in the MediaTek MT6582 platform. There's also 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage, expandable via the on-board microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Android 4.4 KitKat with Acer's custom UI modifications on top. We're happy to report it's really snappy and responsive. One of the main software features of the company is its Extend app that lets you control the phone from your PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can accept calls, transfer files and send/receive messages. It works as advertised, albeit a bit slow. However, this was because the floor's Wi-Fi wasn't exactly lightning fast and you will definitely experience better results in your own network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Liquid Jade, there's a 13MP camera with an f/1.8 aperture and LED light. The 2,100mAh battery isn't replaceable. While we're at it, we should mention the special speaker located at the bottom. It is Dolby DTS certified but we were unfortunately unable to experience it on the IFA floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade launches in the end of September. It will cost ?229 SIM-free and will be available in a dual-SIM version, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Z500 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer wants to makeit big in Europe with its ?150 Acer Liqduid Z500. The phone is based on a 5" IPS screen of 720p resolution (293ppi) and 900:1 contrast ratio. There are two front-facing speakers too, with DTS Studio Sound tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer has a flip cover with a window in it so it can provide both screen protection and at-a-glance info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Z500 has a metal frame that gives it a pleasantly solid feel but the back is plastic. Not that we can expect any different at this price point. The phone isn't as thin or as light as the Liquid Jade but at 8.7mm it's reasonably slim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the back, there is the so-called Action button located under the camera that launches Google Music. This and the stereo speakers make the Z500 a nice music-centric offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music isn't its only trick trick though, the camera itself is an 8MP shooter with a fast f/2.0 lens and 1080p video capture. Those are much better specs than you typically get in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Z500 runs Android 4.4 KitKat on a quad-core 1.3GHz processor. The UI felt snappy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will launch on Septeber 15 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at approximately ?150 (obviously the price may vary by country). There are three color options - Titanium Black, Sandy Silver and Aquamarine Green.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe X2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 is the "world's first layered smartphone." Besides being made of several distinct layers, you can also "layer on" various accessories to the phone's body that's a slender 7.3mm thick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Visually, the body of the Vibe X2 is divided into four colorful layers too, which makes for a unique and attractive design. As for the colors you get a choice of White, Dark grey, Gold and Red, the accessories will have matching color options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different layers create an unusual feel in the hand but we have to say some of the edges were a little too sharp for us. The rear felt like quality matte plastic that's virtually fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the Vibe Xtension layers is an extra battery case that adds 5.1mm to the thickness alongside 75% more juice. It's good to see an first-party solution instead of having to rely on aftermarket battery packs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second Xtension is more fun, a big loudspeaker by JBL that has a built-in kickstand and an analog volume knob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 has a 13MP main camera with an LED flash and a selfie centric 5MP front-facing camera. You can snap a selfie by blinking (the phone waits for you to open your eyes, obviously) or you can wave your hand in front of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone boasts a 5" IPS LCD of 1080p resolution. It looked great at an angle and was surprisingly bright if a little reflective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The package is powered by a MediaTek MT6595m True8Core chipset, which combines four Corex-A17 cores with four Cortex-A7 cores. You get 32GB of built-in storage but no expansion slot. There's also a PowerVR G600 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 runs Android 4.4 KitKat, skinned with Vibe UI 2.0. It changed a whole lot about the Android interface (so not suitable for purists) but the interface was still snappy, despite all the custom stuff running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset provides LTE Cat. 4 connectivity for up to 150Mbps downlink speeds and, in the Asia-Pacific market, dual-SIM. The Vibe X2 will be a single-SIM device elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 will be available at $400 SIM-free in October starting in China and expanding to Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe Z2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Z2 is a 5.5" phablet and Lenovo's first 64-bit handset. This comes courtesy of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset with four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.2GHz and 2GB of RAM. It runs Android 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Z2 has a 5.5" 720p screen (267ppi) boasting 600nits of brightness. The image quality (in terms of colors and viewing angles) is similar to that of the Vibe X2 but it's not as sharp as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department on the Z2 is even more interesting than that of the X2. It has a 13MP Sony Exmor RS sensor with optical stabilization and dual-LED flash and an 8MP front-facing camera. The rear camera lens has a red trim, which we found quite attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet has a brushed metal unibody, the front of the device fits snugly into its metal cage. This leaves some edges exposed, which weren't a problem but could be a love it or hate it thing. The body measures 7.8mm thick and weighs 158g (not much for something this size) and that's with a 3,000mAh Li-Po battery. The body comes in White, Titanium and Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 410 chipset enables 4G LTE connectivity and will be a dual-SIM device for all markets it will be available in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe Z2 will launch in October at $430 and follow in the footsteps of the Vibe X2, starting in China and expanding to Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Tab S8 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Tab S8 is an 8" tablet of slim bezels, standing at 209.8 x 123.8 x 7.9mm. The back finish isn't glossy but it wasn't as good as the material used on the Vibe X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the tablet is available in several bright, attractive colors. Color options include Ebony, Blue, Canary Yellow and White (which for some reason is subject to regional availability).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is fairly sharp at 1,920 x 1,200px (that's 283ppi) and, better yet, has great viewing angles thanks to its IPS matrix. Colors were good but the screen was a touch dim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bezels may be thin but they are big enough to fit two front-facing stereo speakers. Lenovo has partnered with Dolby to provide an equalizer for extensive audio tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the front is a 1.6MP camera, while the back camera is an 8MP shooter with autofocus, f/2.2 aperture and LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Tab S8 is powered by an Intel Atom Z3745 chipset with four CPU cores at 1.3GHz (Burst to 1.86GHz) and 2GB of RAM. It's running Android 4.4 KitKat, which Lenovo has barely touched. The chipset is 64-bit capable but proper support won't arrive until Android L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet features a microUSB 3.0 port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Tab S8 will cost $200 for the Wi-Fi only model, but there will be a 4G LTE version too. Both have 16GB of built-in storage (with microSD card slot for more) and a 4,290mAh battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Prestigio Multiphone 8500 DUO hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Prestigio entered the Windows Phone realm with a pair of new dual-SIM smartphones which the company introduced back in June. The 8500 and 8400 DUO aim to compete with Nokia smartphones in the mid- and lower-end of the WP lineup, and have the potential to do so if priced right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Multiphone 8500 DUO features a 5-inch 720p display covered in Gorilla Glass, alongside a quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 200 chip, 1GB/8GB of RAM/storage, and a 2000mAh battery. The display is fairly sharp and features some good colors and angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear panel is of matted plastic that is resistant to fingerprints, even standing up well to the large amount of people that handled it here on the IFA floors. Performance is adequately fast and there's almost no detectable lag while browsing the WP8.1 interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8500 DUO could be a real contender to the just-announced Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM, as it features largely the same specs, and was recently priced in Russia at ?170.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Prestigio Multiphone 8400 DUO hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prestigio Multiphone 8400 DUO is decidedly the lesser member of the two. With its 4-inch WVGA screen, quad-core 1.2GHz CPU and 512MB/4GB of RAM/storage, the 8400 DUO targets the entry level WP market that is dominated by the likes of the Nokia Lumia 520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right off the bat the 8400 DUO has the feeling of a low-budget device, with the low-resolution display and unimpressive colors being an immediate eyesore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is made of plastic that is a veritable grease magnet, while the 11mm thickness does not help much with handling either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the 8400 DUO has relatively lag-free performance, but we expect an ultra-low price point to make this device more than a side-note to the Lumia 520.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Garmin vivosmart hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Garmin vivosmart is the latest smart tracker from the famous satellite navigation company. It's able to track health and wellness goals and gives you vibration alerts for calls, texts, and more. It has a 5 ATM water rating for up to 50m.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of its hidden OLED display, the Vivosmart band looks like a regular fashion accessory when not in use. It's not a particularly good looking fashion accessory, but it's way better than Sony's SmartBand, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in use, it displays a line of text containing all sorts of notifications that your phone can display - essentially a tracking view of your notification area. It can also control the VIRB Action camera if you happen to own one of those. The other benefits come courtesy of the app for your smartphone and the built-in sensors which allow you to keep track of your workouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clasp is very easy to adjust and the plastic feels reasonably sturdy, but it's hardly eye-catching. Not for the right reasons, anyway. It charges using an odd looking dock that at least has the benefit of holding it horizontal so it can be used as a nightstand watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivosmart will go on sale in the US in September at a suggested retail price of $169. Other online retailers will have it starting in November.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>META M1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The META M1 is an impressively built e-Ink smartwatch that feels nicely heavy on the wrist - there's not a doubt that it's a high-quality product the moment you put it on. Created by a former Vertu designer it, really shows in both the language used and the build quality. It's essentially what the Pebble Steel should have been.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, an e-ink screen is not the ideal choice for either a watch or a smart device and it somewhat spoils the looks of the device. On the positive side it does have a backlight so you can see it in the dark and it allows for the watch to run for 5-7 days between charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We doubt this one will be appreciated by woman, despite the few feminine-targeted bands. As for men - it's certainly unorthodox, so it's going to be a love it or hate it affair. We happen to be in the first category but even if you fall in the second, you'll still appreciate the extra weight coming from the premium materials and the excellent build. Still, we would have liked to see a P-OLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't have the extensive app database of the Pebble either, but it's so much prettier than it - even the regular rubber band version is better looking than the Pebble steel. The clasps on the all the versions but the metal one are of the cheapest possible type - even though they seem durable. The metal one is the only one with a butterfly clasp, but it will run you a cool $449.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for what it does - it basically shows notifications and that's that. You get all the notifications from the notification area of your Android/iOS device, but no extra functionality. The META app lets you customize watchfaces and basic notification settings. Windows Phone compatibility is not expected anytime soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The META M1 is available now between ?249-?449 from the company's online store, with shipments beginning next week.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Withings Activité hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Withings Activité is a swiss-made watch with a built-in smartband. This is what we hoped smartwatches will look like before they came to the market - something along the lines of already existing watches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Activité is exactly that - a regular Swiss movement watch with a standard 18mm strap that you are free to replace easily with the built-in remove toggle. Better yet, it's waterproof and lasts up to a year with a regular battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The catch? Well it's not really a smartwatch - it's more of a strapband with only a few sensors stuck underneath the watchface. Paired with its smartphone app it will allow you to monitor your exercises, but it will not bring you any notifications or vibration alerts for calls or messages and the like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is it a good purchase? Well at about ?400-450 euro as the guys at the booth say it will cost, it's not a terrible price for a Swiss-made watch, but there are definitely cheaper and better looking offerings out there. And for a smart band it's a proper robbery - quite a few of those come with two digit prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mixing the two together was certainly a challenging task, however, and Whitings have had a good first attempt at it. So, if you like the design, have lots of disposable cash and are a bit of a geek (but don't wont to advertise that side of yours with a proper smartwatch) then it's worth a look.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Hero 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Hero 2 smartphone is the company's latest flagship phablet, revealed here at IFA 2014. It relies on a 6" 1080p IPS LCD of 367ppi, an octa-core chipset that has eight 2.0GHz Cortex-A7 cores and a Mali-450MP4 GPU to go along with the 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back there's a 13.1MP snapper while the front has a 5MP 1080p one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hero 2 looks great. It's clean and sleek and its metal-clad back feels ice cold in the hand - giving it an air of quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is great. Despite being lower than the obscene 400ppi and 500ppi screens in terms of sharpness it still looks great. Viewing angles aren't perfect but aren't bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hero 2 has a stylus that slots inside the body of the tablet and can be used to scribble notes and on screenshots and generally operate the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software by Alcatel is based on Android 4.4.2 KitKat and feels snappy on the MediaTek chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Hero 2 is a big device as you can see below but it isn't too heavy to lug around. It's still too big to comfortably use with a single hand and its size is on the upper edge of phablets, even half an inch more will make it a small tablet and not a big phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a couple of samples at the demo area from the 13MP camera of the Hero 2 - here they go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p@30 fps video sample (31.2MB, 0.15s) we shot indoors with the Alcatel Hero 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Hero 8 tablet hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Hero 8 tablet is a portable 8" slate with a 1920 x 1200px 8" display and an octa-core MediaTek chipset with a 2.0GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a Mali-450MP4 GPU. It's a premium-feeling portable tablet with an aluminum back plate to its unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Alcatel Hero 8 is vibrant and bright but quite reflective. We found it hard to see under even small angles while under the demo stage's lights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two speakers on the right side of the Hero 8 and an infrared port along with the 3.5mm headphone jack on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We played around with a folding case that attaches to the Hero 8 tablet. It's nice enough but more impressively attaches with tremendous strength to the tablet and we even hung it on the hinge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only that, but the case can only visualize the clock and notifications from the tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Archos 50b Platinum hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 50b Platinum is the biggest of the three smartphones Archos had on display today at IFA 2014 in Berlin. It packs a 5" display of qHD (540 x 960px) resolution, quad-core 1.3GHz processor and 8MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs on Android KitKat and will cost just ?149.99 but backs it up with an 8MP camera on the back, 2MP one on the front and 4GB of on-board storage expandable via a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True to its low key specs and affordable price tag the Archos 50b Platinum has some drawbacks like a subpar display. It doesn't have the most impressive colors, the resolution is really thin on the large diagonal and pixels are visible. The panel above the display is very prone to fingerprints and got smudged badly while we we're playing around with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic on the back is matte and really nice to touch. The colors are really fresh and pop out. For this price you can really get better quality plastic, mind you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Archos has gone with a clean, almost stock Android experience and Google purists. The UI works just fine and we didn't notice any stutters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Archos 45c Platinum hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Archos 45c Platinum has a 4.5" display of 480 x 854px resolution and it's an IPS unit so viewing angles aren't bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same quad-core 1.3GHz processor runs the show and the user experience is also built around a stock Android KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 45c Platinum will cost just ?109.99 for what it brings to the table making it an overall good deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display sadly is still as smudge-prone as the one on the Archos 50b Platinum and at around the same density (218ppi) it isn't sharper. Pixels are visible and the colors are unimpressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Archos 40 Cesium hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally the Archos 40 Cesium which is the cheapest of the three at just ?79.99. It's a departure from the rest by bringing the latest Windows Phone 8.1 to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 40 Cesium is built around a Snapdragon 200 chipset, 4" WVGA (480 x 800px) display and a 5MP/2MP camera duo (back and front).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Archos 40 Cesium's display isn't as pixelated due to having a slightly better density at 233ppi but the TFT unit isn't impressive on quality. Smudges are, again, an issue and the plastic body isn't as good as on the others, probably to maintain the low price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the flip side the performance of the Archos 40 Cesium is good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>CAT S50<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CAT used the IFA floor this year to debut its new rugged Android smartphone called S50. It brings mid-range specs in a military-grade protected shell with shatter-proof glass at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>CAT S50 features a 4.7" 720p display and runs on a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor. The rest of the specs include an 8MP rear camera with 720p video and LED flash, 8GB expandable storage and even LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CAT S50 has two different protection ratings - IP67 and MIL-810G. The IP67 certification means the CAT S50 is dust protected and water resistant up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. The MIL-810G means it can withstand salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport and thermal shock resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, of course that ruggedness comes at a price and it's the less than perfectly compact shell of the smartphone. Not only does it have some of the largest footprint among all smartphones of the same screen size, but it's also much thicker than anything we've encountered recently, regardless of screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is build quality or in-hand feel haven't been affected at all and even though it's a bit too large to comfortably manage, it does give a pleasant feel to your fingers. It feels very much like the high-quality work tool it actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is decent with the 720p resolution feeling perfectly adequate, if not overly impressive, on the 4.7" diagonal. Colors are only okay but the viewing angles are wide enough to keep the contents of the screen readable even when looked from its side - it's not a pretty side, but it does the job. We couldn't judge reflectivity in bright sunlight, but the CAT S50 seemed to fare well inside the room we tested it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side the CAT S50 offers a largely unmodified Android 4.4 KitKat - something Android purists will really appreciate. All CAT did on top of that was add its newly announced CAT App Store with 1000+ hand-picked apps it feels are most relevant to the specific audience this phone is targeting as well as pre-install a few other apps from its portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is about right given the screen resolution and the quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU powering the S50. This is to say not everything is happening instantly and some large apps take a while to open, but there's no lag to annoy you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also managed to do a short hands-on video with the CAT S50 that you can check out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the CAT S50 feels like a decent smartphone that can do the job for anyone with moderate app appetite and that is not too much into gaming. And given its target market, we'd say that's not a bad place to be.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE's presence at this year's IFA wasn't spectacular in terms of booth size, but the company didn't go unnoticed by us. The Chinese had a new trio of smartphones to show off, one for each pricing tier. Let's start off with the relatively high-end and work our way to the affordable offerings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Blade Vec 4G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE "flagship" that made its debut at IFA is the Blade Vec 4G. The slim LTE-enabled smartphone features a 5" 720p LCD display and a 7.8mm thin body. We liked the vibrant colors and good viewing angles of the phone. Contrast was also okay, but we would've preferred ZTE to fit its high-spec smartphone with a 1080p display. Still, it was quite sharp despite the fact you could see individual pixels if you really tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood of the ZTE Blade Vec 4G operates a Snapdragon 400 chipset with a 1.2GHz quad Cortex-A7 processor and 1GB RAM. The phone has Cat. 4 LTE connectivity (up to 150Mbps downlink), tri-band 2G, dual-band 3G, Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. There's 16GB of storage with a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aesthetically, the phone looks very pleasing. The carbon finish on the back combined with the glass design is cool to say the least. Its 170 grams weight is very well distributed, too, and as such feels great in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.4 KitKat runs smoothly and the UI experience is what you'd expect without too many crazy alterations going on. In spite of its thin profile, the Blade Vec 4G boasts a battery of 2300mAh. There's 16GB of storage with a microSD card slot, which is always nice to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expect the phone to start selling in Turkey, France, Romania, Slovakia, Belgium, Norway and Sweden (if it hasn't already) shortly with a price of ?230.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Blade Vec 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Don't confuse the Vec 3G with its LTE-packing counterpart. Both inside and out, the two differ from one another substantially. The phone keeps the 5" 720 LCD display as its more expensive brother, but on the inside it packs a MediaTek MT6582 chipset with a 1.3GHz quad-core Cotex-A7 and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't notice marginal differences in the performance, but since the MediaTek chipset is cheaper than the Qualcomm-made Snapdragon 400, the Blade Vec 3G is lighter on your wallet with a price tag of ?180.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For that price you get an 8MP snapper at the back and a 5MP one at the front. Unlike the Blade Vec 4G, which has to rely on a 1MP (or 2MP, depending on the market) camera for selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Visually, the Blade Vec 3G is 4mm shorter than its LTE counterpart and the back is with a matte finish. It still rocks a carbon apparel, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Kis 3 Max<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the ZTE Kis 3 Max, which is the company's lowest-end smartphone to visit IFA 2014. It features a 4.5" FWVGA screen with an old TN TFT matrix. Needless to say, it's neither sharp, nor particularly eye-catching. At least, the phone is light at 135 grams and its plastic feels nice to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the outside it reminds us a lot of previous Xperia smartphones and we have to point out that the capacitive buttons below the display look particularly cool. They glow blue (almost purple) and are definitely a key aesthetic feature for the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the Kis 3 Max features a 5MP snapper coupled with a 2MP at the front. The MediaTek MT6572 chipset with a dual-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 CPU runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat okay. We noticed a few stutters here and there, but nothing that would classify the phone as unusable. There's also 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory (microSD card slot is present).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity is similar to the Blade Vec 3G - tri-band 2G, dual-band 2G, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0. The battery is smaller than the Blade Vec's, 1,850mAh. The phone carries a price tag of ?100 and is destined to launch in the UK, Germany, Greece and Bulgaria.</paragraph>
