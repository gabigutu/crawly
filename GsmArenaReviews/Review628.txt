			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo knows that you always split aces, so the new R7 comes in two versions. The 5" Oppo R7 and 6" R7 Plus share a lot - both are metal-clad knights, with 1080p AMOLED screens, they shoot 13MP images through Schneider-Kreuznach certified optics and they offer practical dual-SIM connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo is proud to have covered the two phones almost entirely in metal and kept the duo quite thin - 6.3mm for the R7 and 7.8mm for the R7 Plus. The company also implemented some flagship camera features into the duo, including name-brand lens and phase detection autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both are powered by the same chipset, Snapdragon 615, and will Color-ified Android 5.1 Lollipop, but the R7 might not get it immediately at launch. Despite the premium build and camera, the two remain quite practical with two SIM slots, one of which can be occupied by a microSD card if you can go without one of the SIM cards. The VOOC charging tech will fill the battery to three quarters in just half an hour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R7 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus is more than just a plus-sized version of the R7. Oppo shaved the side bezels down to nothing for a more attractive design (it's not small by any means at 203g). It has a more advanced camera with an RGBW sensor and laser autofocus, also it offers better security with a fingerprint sensor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R7 Plus at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Oppo R7 and R7 Plus are launching tomorrow, in China at least, but for now we're among the select few that have an R7 in our hands - and we're typing away our initial impressions, so stay tuned!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R7 Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus is the larger of the two models announced today, and despite the identical chipset and RAM, there are plenty of differences that set it apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, the 6-inch display is the most readily noticeable upgrade, but the higher screen-to-body ratio means that the smartphone is not all that much larger than the R7 as the jump from 5 to 6 inches would suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 158 x 82 x 7.8 mm it's more or less the same size as the 6-inch Huawei Ascend Mate7, and a tenth of a millimeter shorter than the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. The R7 Plus is, however, quite heavy at 203g, a good 10% more than the Mate7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design language is similar on the two Oppo models, with the finely crafted all metal unibody looking stylish and classy. Oppo is keen to point out that the magnesium-aluminum alloy body has undergone 48 polishing processes, and while we weren't there to count them, the device sure feels premium to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the position of the power button and the volume rocker is mirrored on the Plus model, compared to the regular R7. Additionally, the R7 Plus comes with on-screen buttons, as opposed to the capacitive ones in the R7's bottom bezel, thus keeping the device relatively compact for the screen diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6-inch display uses an AMOLED panel of 1,080 x 1,920 pixel resolution. The highlight here is the edge-to-edge feature, though it's less impressive than we expected. While it does look the part with the display off, firing it up reveals a pitch-black frame surrounding the lit area - the bezels are there, only they're underneath the 2.5D curved glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to more practical considerations, the display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. It's still reasonably sharp, though the 367ppi density is nothing spectacular by today's standards. Owing to the inherent qualities of the AMOLED tech, the panel provides great contrast and viewing angles. Colors are vivid and it's quite bright as well. We took the device outside to see how it fares in the sunlight and we have nothing but praise for it at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back, much like the one on the Mate7. Located below the camera module, it's in a natural position for access with your index finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a multitude of camera features too. The R7 Plus comes with a 13MP ISOCELL RGBW sensor, unlike the conventional RGB imager found in the R7. Oppo claims that the sensor outputs images with 78% less noise and can pick up 32% more light, though we haven't been able to verify how it performs just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the phase detection autofocus in the R7, the Plus model also brings laser autofocus as well. A dual-LED flash is another improvement over the single-LED unit of the R7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like its smaller sibling, the Oppo R7 Plus boots the company's latest ColorOS v2.1, which is based on Android 5.1. It runs fluently on the Snapdragon 615 and the 3GB of RAM provide ample room for multitasking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 is the more compact of the two devices and comes with a more traditional look. But just because it is outshined by the bigger R7 Plus, doesn't mean it is void of merits itself. The device boasts a slick and clean all-metal exterior and with its more conventional screen size it will probably appeal to a wider audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo refers to the design as "Lineism" and even compares the arcs to those on a violin. It is clear that a lot of emphasis is placed on elegance. Frankly, we have to agree that the R7 is a charmer. It is made with excellent taste and a lot of moderation, but we will refrain from going into poetic descriptions ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 employs a unibody design and what is referred to as "aircraft-grade aluminum alloy" that has undergone a painstaking 48-step polishing process to achieve the final result. The phone is available in silver and gold colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller R7 clearly has a wider bezel than its sibling with its 5.0-inch Full HD display surrounded by white stripes with a 2.5D finish, but it also has a pretty prominent black bezel around the display itself. Seeing how it uses AMOLED technology, this outer frame is nearly invisible when the display is off, but once turned on, it is pretty apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As long as we are on the topic of display, the 5.0-inch AMOLED unit seems to be a solid choice. Is offers a superb viewing experience with excellent side viewing angles. Colors are nice and vibrant and the picture is very sharp at 445ppi and with a nice contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also can't fail to mention that the R7 is quite slim and definitely fits snugly in the hand. It is 143 mm tall and 71 mm wide with a thickness of only 6.3 mm. It weighs in at 147 grams, which is definitely justifiable, considering all the metal. The 2.5D glass and body curves really bring out the best in the design and create a convincing illusion of an even thinner body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing really out of the ordinary regarding the controls on the R7 and the R7 Plus as well. Whereas competitors like ZTE are going crazy with new and innovative gestures, Oppo has stuck to basics. Rather inexplicably, though, the two devices have most of their buttons swapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the R7 the power button is on the left and volume rockers on the right, while the R7 Plus has them the other way around. The buttons themselves are nicely rounded and also made of metal. Placement is also convenient in terms of height.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going round the device, on top, we find a 3.5mm audio jack and not much else. There is also a small plastic insert on the top frame, presumably for an antenna. Still, it works as a nice little color accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side, we only find the power-button. The rest of it is absolutely empty, which looks very clean and neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side offers much of the same. The volume rockers are nicely defined with a groove in the middle and are also quite convenient to use. The only other thing found here is the card tray. The two SIM card go on the same tray and you have to choose between using two SIM cards or popping in a microSD card in place of one. This definitely saves room and removes needless slots for many but those wanting dual SIM and storage expansion will be disappointed. The cradle itself fits nicely into the bezel, making the side nice and flush.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is equally clean. There is a USB port in the middle and a microphone slightly to the left of it. The only other thing are two plastic inserts. Once again, a nice little color accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the Oppo R7 is a little busier. Naturally, it houses the 13MP camera, which occupies the top left corner, along with a single LED flash. On a side note, a lot is missing from the camera itself, compared to the R7 Plus. There is no dual-tone flash, no laser focus and the sensor is different as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the camera, there is also a secondary microphone here. At the bottom, there is a speaker grille and quite a bit of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the R7 have quite noticeable plastic inlays. These, of course, are necessary for the radios to work, seeing how the rest of the body is metal, but, perhaps Oppo should have went with something more subtle, like the patterns of the iPhone 6 or the HTC One M9. On the other hand, it doesn't really take that much off the overall impression. We really like the little dimple on the bottom which is intended to prevent the rear speaker from getting muffled easily. These sort of tiny details really do matter in everyday use and it is evident that Oppo has invested a lot of effort into the R7.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 shares most of its internals with its bigger sibling the R7 Plus. This strikes as kind of odd, as both essentially offer mid-range chips. They are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 SoC (MSM8939) with an octa-core CPU clocked at 1.5GHz. This is nowhere near as powerful as most current flagships, but should still suffice for fluid experience. The graphics department is run by an Adreno 405, which should breeze through casual games, but might struggle with heavier titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, we will update you with the exact performance numbers, as soon as we manage to get through all the benchmarks and work the results out, so check back if you are interested in the synthetic tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has opted to put 3GB of RAM in both the R7 and R7 Plus. During the presentation, memory was singled out as a major bottleneck in today's smartphones and 3GB should remedy the fact. This does seem enough, but we still hope the mid-range processor won't throttle overall performance too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the specs sheet for the Oppo R7 also includes 16GB of onboard memory and an array of sensors - compass, accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices also have the benefit of Oppo's own VOOC fast charging technology. It definitely stands out among the competition. And while we are on the topic of power, the R7 has a non-removable battery, just like its bigger sibling, but it is quite less spacious with a capacity on 2320 mAh, instead of the whopping 4100 mAh on the R7 Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also need to mention that both phones have LTE connectivity, albeit only for one of the two SIM cards, the other one only has 3G speeds at its disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 is more than just a pretty shell. It shines in the software department as well. Oppo's own Color OS has come a long way and the new version 2.1 is prettier and faster than ever. It is based on Android KitKat, which will later be updated to Lollipop to match the Plus model. The reason Oppo quoted is that work on the R7 began before Lollipop was unveiled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some screenshots of the desktop and app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even before the update hits the R7 still has the redesigned UI and the new visuals will extend beyond the built-in apps and features an icon pack for about 200 popular applications, so everything appears nice and uniform. Performance improvements are supposedly there as well. Oppo boasts a reduced boot time, from 31 seconds in Color OS 2.0 to just 19 seconds in the new version. The platform is also said to be optimized for faster system app launches. Oppo has also done some optimizations for several popular third-party applications, which should be a lot more fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few more shots of various built-in applications and the theme store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have a few shots from the settings menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of these software aspects will be discussed at length in our full review later down the road, so stay tuned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Oppo R7 is shaping up to be quite an impressive mid-range offer. With a sleek all-metal exterior and a price tag of about $400, we can definitely see a lot of appeal with certain users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones launch this month in China, while internationally we should see them around mid-June.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 is equipped with a 13MP main shooter with ISOCELL sensor and a single LED flash and luckily we managed to put it through its paces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's too early to be passing any verdicts on the actual image quality but the early signs are positive Everything looks nice and crisp, with a nice level of resolved detail and little noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of shots from the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few regular shots with a resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a low-light shot for you to check out as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR works pretty well too and produces some nice and natural-looking results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a special HD mode, which takes a few shots and stitches them together to achieve a higher resolution shot. It works fairly well too and we managed to get up to a resolution of 5824 x 4368 pixels. The results are in the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of 1080p video samples as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app itself works pretty fast. It launches almost instantaneously and shoots at an impressive rate. The UI is quite reminiscent of the iOS camera app. Just like on an iPhone, you can adjust the exposure by touching and dragging up and down anywhere on the screen. It is really quite convenient.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R7 benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As promised, we ran some synthetic benchmarks on the Oppo R7 and here are the results. Bear in mind that the unit we had at our disposal in not final yet, so, some performance drops are expected. Also, as it turns out, only the bigger Oppo R7 Plus will have Android Lollipop at launch. For the time being, the R7 still runs on the Android 4.4 KitKat, but it's got the latest Color OS 2.1 on top. The Lollipop update however is already in the works..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, we didn't quite manage to run all of our regular tests on the said unit, but we still have enough to work with. We picked quite a diverse array of contenders for the R7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In one group, we have devices, running the same Snapdragon 615 chipset. As previously mentioned, this is essentially an upper mid-range processor and it definitely performs accordingly. These include the Samsung Galaxy A7, HTC Desire 820, Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and the ZTE Blade S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, The Oppo R7 and especially the bigger and pricier R7 Plus do contend to be high-end devices and, as such, we have also included the Galaxy S6, HTC One M9 and LG G4, to see, how it fairs among other flagships. Last, but not least, we set out to see what else is available around the $400 price tag of the R7. The rest of the included phones, phones, generally fall under this category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, we have two allround test available - GeekBench 3 and Basemark OS 2.0. It both scoreboards, the Oppo R7 sits comfortably, where you would expect to see a Snapdragon 615 device. Interestingly enough, in both instances the phone is outperformed by the Galaxy A7, which runs on the exact same chipset. This could be a matter of optimization.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we have GFX graphics test. The Oppo R7 is equipped with an Adreno 405, which is by no means a powerhouse, but still gets the job done. Performance, once again, is just as we expected. Onscreen and offscreen performance are pretty comparable, due to the 1080p screen resolution and both are near the bottom of our list. The older T-Rex test churns out about 15 frames and the newer Manhattan, almost 6 fps. This is more than enough for most casual games, but heavier titles probably won't runs as smoothly as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's with the Oppo R7 and Oppo R7 Plus for now. We were left with all but positive impressions of both phones we can't wait to get proper review units.</paragraph>
