			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is one of the Finns' first ever smartphones to run Android and yet it may not be the Android phone you've been looking for. Perhaps you've been looking in the wrong place? Nokia will certainly like you to think so. To be honest though - never mind the Normandy codename - this is obviously not the D-day in smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X was not made to compete with the best out there. It is the exact opposite of a flagship - low-cost hardware delivering reasonable performance at a bargain price. No Google services but Nokia's and Microsoft's instead. No Google Play Store but plenty of Android apps in the Nokia and other stores. No Android level of customization but a blend of Lumia and Asha simplicity. It's Android like you never seen it before. Intrigued?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The operating system is built on the Android Open Source Project, which in turn is been based on 4.1 Jelly Bean, but looks nothing like. On the inside and outside, this is more like Asha with a Windows Phone twist. Fastlane meets resizable tiles - a simple to use combo, user friendly and light on the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The absence of Google services is surely a deal-breaker for those hoping to get the pure Android experience on a Nokia phone. Of course, the Nokia and Microsoft's alternatives are there: HERE Maps and Navigation (instead of Google Maps), OneDrive (instead of Google Drive), Nokia Mail (instead of Gmail), Nokia Store (instead of Google Play). Ultimately, you won't be able to sync your Google Contacts and Calendar but Nokia pushing its own agenda is hardly a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X has a simple objective: keep cheap droids at bay. But not Samsung's, LG's or Sony's cheap droids - it's the countless - nameless - dirt-cheap Android-powered smartphones Nokia worries about. They're a real threat to their Asha lineup in developing markets and entry-level Lumias elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the X-line, the Finns are sticking a competitively-priced smartphone in your hands, and save you the embarrassing disputes about how smart the Ashas really are. And hey, the Nokia X and its siblings have to be cheap not only because they compete with the cheapest of droids. It's because the Lumia line needs to feel like an upgrade - which is the ultimate goal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Politics aside, everything else about the X-line seems pretty straightforward. Asha simplicity and Windows Phone aesthetics thrown in the Android shaker. Done teasing you, our traditional exterior close-up comes next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: Speaking of the X-line, the Nokia X+ is essentially the same phone as the Nokia X, except with 768MB RAM instead of 512MB. Keep that in mind for the benchmark section, but everything else is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to Nokia India and BloggersMind for providing the review unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X comes in the traditional blue cardboard paper box that packs a single-piece microUSB charger and a headset. There is no microUSB data cable inside, nor is there a complimentary microSD card. The pink earphones are the same thing you get with the most recent Asha phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing on the box to suggest this phone is in any way special, as in the first Nokia device to run Android. No mention of the Google OS whatsoever. It's the Nokia X Software Platform.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is a pleasingly compact phone. At 115.5 x 63 x 10.4mm, it weighs about 129g, which gives it a solid feel without damaging portability, which is important for an all-plastic handset. The numbers will probably fail to get across how good it feels in the hand. The clinically clean design is well familiar but by no means boring.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X can be easily mistaken for one of them 500-series Ashas. The shape and feel, the bright-colored exchangeable covers, the single Back key below the screen. The latter is the capacitive kind, like on the Asha 503, the other Ashas having a proper physical button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big difference is size - and by the way the added height and width is more than acceptable for the screen real estate gained. The Nokia X's screen has grown a whole inch in diagonal and while there're still more than ample bezel, but that was to be expected in the price bracket. The 4" WVGA screen has an IPS matrix - a great advantage in this price range. What the Nokia X lacks is Gorilla Glass protection, which is strange considering the Asha 503 has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The centered touch-sensitive Back button is the only control below the screen, the earpiece symmetrically placed across. The microphone pinhole is barely visible in the bottom right corner, where the front glass meets the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X comes with both an ambient-light sensor for automatic brightness and a proximity sensor, which turns the screen off during a call. Both are next to the earpiece, but almost impossible to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Asha phones based on the same design, the Nokia X breaks down into two - the battery cover wraps firmly around the inner body. We have the black flavor of the X, which isn't as impressive as its colorful siblings. But if you get the green, red, cyan, yellow or white version, the back panel that folds around the body will give a slim frame around the screen as an accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia X has the 3.15MP camera lens and the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used is nice to the touch, with a soft matte finish that completely rules out visible fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet we like the Nokia X design. Whatever the color, the matte finish has nice grip, while the compact size makes it a pleasure to handle and operate. The styling is simple and efficient, influenced by both Asha and Lumia, and the choice of colorful covers is certainly welcome.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X's right side features a power button and the volume rocker. Both controls are solid to press and comfortably placed within your thumb's reach. You can unlock the X with the power key, but you can also do so with a double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left side of the X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top pf the Nokia X accommodates the 3.5mm audio jack, while the bottom has the microUSB port you'll use for charging and computer connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping out the battery cover isn't as easy as on the Asha series. You have to almost bend the phone at one of the corners, so careful not to drop the X while doing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the battery cover is removed, you'll get access to the 1,500mAh Li-Ion battery. The two microSIM compartments are next to the microSD slot, but none of those is hot-swappable. The battery needs to be out of its compartment for the SIM/SD cards to be accessible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Nokia X is a 4" IPS LCD unit of WVGA (480 x 800 pixels) resolution, which boils down to around 233ppi. That's pretty much enough for comfortable web browsing, media viewing and even reading documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB - it's an LCD screen so you wouldn't expect anything less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are nice and punchy although the screen is hardly the brightest around bright. The response is good too, not top notch, but good enough for a budget smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the scores from our dedicated tests - contrast levels are mediocre, which was to be expected in this price range and the brightness isn't particularly high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is also highly reflective, which combined with the uninspiring brightness makes the Nokia X display particularly hard to read in bright sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X boasts a 1,500mAh battery unit, which Nokia says it'll last half a day on calls or 17 days on standby with two SIMs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our tests revealed the battery is indeed enough for half a day on 3G calls, which is good considering the small capacity. Its performance on video playback and web browsing is rather mediocre though. The dual-SIM stand-by is OK, but nothing impressive and we are not sure if the Nokia X will make it to the 17 days promise. All of our tests brought the Nokia X overall rating of 38 hours. That's how long the phone will go between charges with an hour of calling, browsing and watching video daily each 24 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Nokia X battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X runs on unrecognizable Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia X is the company's first smartphone running on Android. Well, sort of. Nokia X is officially calling it the Nokia X Software Platform v1.0, which is basically a forked version of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Long story short - it's Android where the Google services have been replaced by Microsoft ones and a custom Nokia launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start exploring the so-called Nokia X platform, here is a UI video walkthrough to get you warmed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at Nokia's custom launcher. It's a mix between the latest Asha Software platform and Windows Phone with an entirely new twist here and there. There is a Glance screen with notifications, there is also the quite familiar lockscreen. Swiping it reveals one of the two homescreens - the app drawer and the Fastlane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen doesn't have any active shortcuts to directly launch apps but it will display notifications for missed calls, incoming messages, installed apps or calendar events. Depending on which side you swipe such notification it will either take you to the relevant app (right) or it'll be dismissed (left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer on Nokia X looks a lot like a Windows Phone homescreen - all apps shortcuts look like Windows Phone live tiles. They are resizable too and you can even change the base color of each tile. What's different is actually none of those tiles is "live" due to the hardware limitations of the device. This homescreen will list of all your installed apps, so it might get really long if you are lazy not to organize your shortcuts in folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standard Android widgets are also supported - you get the familiar analogue clock, calendar, email, Facebook, Power Control Deck and more. Apps that come with a dedicated widget, such as the BBM, will also appear in the widget menu too. We suggest not to use too many widgets though because they may noticeably impact the overall system performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping left or right the app drawer will take you to the other homescreen called Fastlane. Those of you familiar with the Asha user interface will recognize it immediately. The Fastlane keeps track of all your recent activity, opened apps go there, recent web pages, along with contacts you've called, messages and emails, calendar events (birthdays, to-dos), recently installed apps, recently shared content, recently taken notes and pictures, radio stations, and even social network posts, replies, likes and goings-on. The music player and the FM radio, if active, will also appear here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fastlane can be personalized from the Settings menu. You can opt out of some of the services and notifications in case you are getting overloaded with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap pull down the status bar to show notifications for missed events and quick toggles for sound profiles, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contextual menus, if available, are accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the display. If an app supports such menu, you'll get a small virtual handle at the bottom, so you won't have to guess if there are additional settings or not.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is powered by a dual-core 1.0GHz Cortex-A5 processor coupled with 512MB of RAM, which should be barely enough to run a standard Android Jelly Bean version. Luckily Nokia has done some great work optimizing platform its proprietary launcher, so the final result is decently smooth with very little visible lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU in charge of graphics is Adreno 203. It is probably the slowest GPU currently in mass production, but it should be enough to handle less demanding games running on WVGA resolution. Unfortunately GFXBenchmark, 3DMark and Epic Citadel are still incompatible with Nokia X, so you'll have to rely on the all-in-one test scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't many benchmarks available in the Nokia Store, but we managed to sideload a few, so we are able to provide you with comparable scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance, as usual, we measure with the BenchmarkPi test. The 1.0 GHz Cortex-A5 processor quite expectedly hit the bottom of our charts, twice slower than its Cortex-A9 siblings and 50% behind the Cortex-A7 cores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 tests the multi-core performance and Nokia X occupied the last spot in our all-time chart. However its performance wasn't too bad considering that all other tested devices are way more expensive than it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-in-one tests AnTuTu and Quadrant gauge the overall hardware performance, including graphics and RAM bandwidth. Nokia X, being the only Cortex-A5 device we've put through the newest versions of the apps once again finished last on both tests, but again the gap was a bit lower than we expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ran SunSpider and BrowserMark web benchmarks on the default Nokia X browser. The Nokia X punched way above its weight here, beating some quite expensive devices in both SunSpider and BrowserMark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X did come out last on most of the tests we ran, but given its modest price that was to be expected. If anything the smartphone does better than expected given its standing in the pecking order. And as we told you the phone handles its platform very well and that's what matters in the end. Yes, some hiccups or bottlenecks may occur if you put huge pressure on the Nokia X but overall - the UI experience and performance is solid.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is divided into three sections that are straightforward and easy to navigate - Groups, Contacts and Favorites. The contact list displays a list of names and pictures only. There is a search field at the top and an alphabetical scrubber on the right. A swipe up from the bottom of the list gets you the Advanced menu and a New contact shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, mail address, notes, events or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - SIM 1, SIM 2 or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved, linked to another contact or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Quick Contact functionality available on Android is available on Nokia X too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone app of the Nokia X is pretty straightforward and works well. The app integrates with the Call log and the Dialer, there is a Contacts tab too. The dialer itself is pretty standard, but sadly it doesn't offer smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the dual-SIM version like we did for this review, you get a dedicated the SIM card switching interface in the notification area. It can be accessed from anywhere and so you will never be asked on which SIM card you want to initiate a voice call from within the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call screen shows options for the keypad, muting a call, putting it on speaker, holding it and entering contacts. If you leave the in-call screen the status bar will notify you of an ongoing call and within a tap on it you'll be back to the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reception with the Nokia X was consistently excellent and in-call sound was loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've put the Nokia X loudspeaker through our traditional test and we found it loud enough not to miss calls or notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in lets you delete the conversation. Creating a message is pretty straightforward. You can add multiple contacts from your phonebook or simply punch in numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose to attach an image, video or audio file, your message will be automatically converted to an MMS. If you opt for an email instead a phone number, you'll be also sending a multimedia message instead of a regular one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard was a pleasant surprise. It looks the same as on the latest Asha Software Platform, but this time around it supports Swype-like input, plus cool swipe gestures for cut, copy and paste. The usual Android cursor and virtual cut, copy and paste shortcuts are available too. The accuracy of the keyboard is really impressive. Both portrait and landscape modes of the keyboards are available as well as text prediction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app looks to be a lightweight version of the default Android client. It supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default email view mode is Inbox but Folder view is supported too. Multiple emails can be deleted using the advanced menu at the bottom of the screen. You can switch between accounts from the Mail client's homepage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on an email will allow you to reply, delete, star, forward or mark it as read/unread.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Snappy image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Nokia X lists all of your albums. In addition to the album view, it also supports sorting by location and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are shown in a grid of three by four that is vertically scrollable. You can pinch or double-tap to zoom on images. You can also share photos via email or Bluetooth and edit them. Editing options include rotating, flipping, cropping, lighting and contrast adjustment and adding color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set images as wallpapers, add them to favorites, see details and start a slideshow from the pull-up context menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asha-like music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X music player has a tabbed interface with four tabs - songs, artists, albums and playlists. Customizable equalizers are available from the advanced menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen shows the usual controls - shuffle, repeat, play/pause, next and previous songs. There is a scrubber, which you can use to skip parts of the song. Album art is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The song will keep playing even if you exit the player - you get a shortcut in the Fastlane and on the lockscreen with play-pause-skip controls readily available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is part of the gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video app, but all of your videos get listed in the gallery instead. You can share, delete or view detailed information from the swipe-able menu at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is technically capable of playing 3GP/MP4/MKV videos up to 1080p resolution, but 720p or higher res usually results in lots of jerkiness and dropped frames, so we'd stick to SD if we had to use this one as a portable player. AC3 audio codec are supported, which is nice. DivX and XviD video codecs are not supported though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers very basic user interface with just a Play/Pause button and a scrubber.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stereo FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia X comes with a neat and simple interface. It supports manual tuning via a dedicated tool at the bottom. You can scroll between stations too, and you can save up to four favorite stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the music player, the FM radio will keep playing when you exit the app - you get a shortcut in the Fastlane and on the lockscreen with the station information and an off switch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive 3.15MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X has a 3.15 MP camera which is capable of capturing images of up to 2048 x 1536 resolution. It doesn't have autofocus, using what Nokia calls full focus lens - basically a fixed-focus camera with a larger depth of field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple - on the right it offers a virtual on-screen shutter, a toggle for switching between camera and camcorder, and a gallery shortcut. There are also white balance, exposure compensation and advanced setting shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of settings into the advanced menu - resolution, ISO, face detection, sharpness, saturation, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the specs suggest, images produced by the Nokia X aren't anything worth writing home about but they will do for the occasional visual memo (not for fine text though - no autofocus is a deal-breaker here) or contact picture. There isn't too much fine detail and dynamic range is limited, but colors are nice and contrast is decent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia X is also capable of 180-degree panorama shots at 2500×500 resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>3MP shooters are getting very rare these days, but there are still plenty you can compare the Nokia X against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia X in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FWVGA video at 30 fps is passable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video capture, the Nokia X camera maxes out at FWVGA (864 x 480) videos with a steady framerate of 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is hardly any better than the still images - colors are nice, contrast too, but the detail is rather low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes the untouched FWVGA video for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X supports quad-band GSM/EDGE on both SIM cards and dual-band 3G networks on its primary SIM card. HSPA is supported too, you get HSDPA speeds up to 7.2Mbps and HSUPA up to 5.76Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n, which will get you fast data speeds and it doesn't eat into your data plan. Bluetooth 3.0 with EDR handles things like wireless hands-free dongles but also local file sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging. There is no USB on-the-go support, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X also has a memory card slot that supports cards up to 32GB capacity. Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Neat web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X has Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. The Nokia Browser pre-installed on the Nokia X, quite expectedly, is based on Chromium. It is fast and fluid, loads web pages really fast and provides great experience for such a low-end device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's tabbed browsing and you can save favorite websites for quick access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one setting in the advanced menu - turn on/off saving passwords.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia X is decently stocked though it lacks any kind of document viewer. As for the file manager, Astro File Manager is available for free in the Nokia Store and works great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day and week view are also available. Adding an event is very easy - you can set start and end time, reminder, location and repeat interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses two rotation rings, making it easy to set the time and you can make it go off only on specific days. Multiple alarms are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also pre-installed Facebook and Twitter clients.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia HERE Maps with voice-guided offline navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia X comes with an integrated GPS receiver and the company is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table - the unified HERE Maps app, which is pretty much as powerful as its Windows Phone famous sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia HERE Maps is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of HERE - offline navigation - you have to download a map for your country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Maps can only be used for navigation in your home country, but not abroad. Even if you buy a new SIM when visiting abroad, it will not change the license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HERE Maps you can easily plan routes (no data connection needed) and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since Nokia X doesn't have Google Play onboard, Nokia had to come up with its own solution. Nokia Store is the dedicated app repository for the Nokia X Platform. Nokia claims 75% of all available Android apps are fully compatible with the Nokia X Platform, the developers just need to submit their apk file to the store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remaining 25% of Android applications available in the Play Store require tweaking in order to work on Nokia X as calls to Google services need to be replaced with ones to Microsoft replacements. Nokia promises the developers won't lose more than 2 hours to do the necessary changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We opened Google Play Store on one of our standard Android phones and checked the Editor's Choice, Top 30 Paid and Top 30 Free sections, then we searched for those apps on the Nokia's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we found is that the X phones use an interesting setup ? there's Nokia's app store, but there are several others preinstalled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If an app isn't available in Nokia's store, but is available in one of the others, it will show up in the search results. Just tap on it and the other app store will launch and repeat the search. We spotted 4-5 different app stores in our searches. Apps marked with a * are from other app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the list of missing apps is longer, but a big portion of those are games, where entry-level phones are always going to be limited. And some of the apps you might be missing can be sided-loaded - as is the case NOVA Launcher. The social networking apps (Facebook and Twitter) and the popular chat apps (WhatsApp, Skype, Line, even Telegram) are all on board and even some popular keyboard replacements such as SwiftKey and Swype are here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Android has advantages after all, huh? More importantly, this seemingly confirms Nokia's claim that most apps are compatible with its brand of Android (the missing apps may be missing because they are not uploaded to the alternative app stores, not that they're incompatible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Nokia has a cool site to help developers test if their app is compatible with Nokia X ? it's literally just drag and drop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There we go, the first Android smartphone by the company, which was never going to have anything to do with Android. Anyone surprised that the Nokia X has nothing to do with droids as we know them? Good. Thought so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funny little handset that one - and its timing is funnier still. Less than a month before the Microsoft acquisition of Nokia devices is finalized. It's tempting to search for conspiracy theories. Look at it as Nokia's last chance to try, last bit of mischief before saying "I do"...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably nothing like it. The Nokia X is so disarmingly simple it's unthinkable to imagine it burdened with politics. An entry-level smartphone, based on AOSP, without Google services and a limited selection of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest though, some entry-level droids are just as limited in their selection of apps - be it because of hardware or an older version of Android. Some of Nokia and Microsoft's services and software will handsomely make up for keeping Google out of it. But this is not a phone for seasoned Android users who want the Google experience on a Finnish device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is a high-end Asha, or an entry-level Lumia phone. The missing link on markets yet to experience a full-scale transition to smartphones. An extra line of defense elsewhere against aggressively priced Android smartphones by white-label manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the best of both worlds - as in Android supplying the apps, while Nokia and Microsoft fill in the gaps and share their exclusive software and services. It's the best of both worlds as in Fastlane meets live tiles. For beginners. The support of Android apps is more than welcome, but of course not those that require Google services to work or version 4.2 or higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, whether you're interested in the Nokia X for the Android heart in the Finnish body, or simply looking for an affordable smartphone, probably your first, let's explore your options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is the starter package in a lineup of three, where the X+ only takes RAM up a notch to 768MB, while the XL adds a 5MP auto-focus camera with LED flash, along with a 5" screen of the same WVGA resolution. All three models are powered by the same Snapdragon S4 chipset and have a dual-SIM version each. There's a 10 euro jump from one model to the next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia X+ ? Nokia XL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X costs about the same as an upgraded Lumia 525 and even slightly more than the original Lumia 520, which did wonders for Nokia in the entry-level segment. These two are perhaps the most affordable way to give Windows Phone 8 (and soon 8.1) a try. The freshly announced Lumia 630 is a slightly more expensive option but it's special enough being the first dual-SIM capable Windows-powered smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 520 ? Nokia Lumia 525 ? Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we have looked at the X in its domestic context, it's time we paid attention to the Android crowd. This is where the Nokia X will have to really fight for its place in the sun. In about the same price bracket, the Sony Xperia E dual and Samsung Galaxy Fame are last season's models running Jelly Bean on slightly less capable hardware, including a lower-res HVGA screen - and both have dual-SIM support. Add the novelty factor and we'd easily say the Nokia X is a more interesting proposition than both of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia E dual ? Samsung Galaxy Fame S6810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently released Sony Xperia E1 dual and Samsung Galaxy Core Duos are well up-to-date though and more like what we are looking for. The Sony Xperia E1 understandably costs more than the Nokia X offering a similar display, but running on a faster Snapdragon 200 chipset with better processor and graphics, plus it has a newer Android version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung's Galaxy Core Duos comes with a slightly bigger display and a better 5MP AF camera, and it is powered by the same Snapdragon S4 Play chipset as the Nokia X. It runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, with TouchWiz and the complete set of Google services. You'll be paying more again, but getting Google Play and Google sync in return.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Core I8260 ? Sony Xperia E1 dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X. The first and most basic Nokia smartphone powered by Android. It's a nice little fella, both on the inside and outside. A beginner's device though, no doubt about that. In many ways not worse than many cheap droids, especially ones from less than reputable makers. A good way to try Android and stay loyal to Nokia / Microsoft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not a phone for existing Android users. Not the beginning of a long-term relationship that will culminate in the next Galaxy S or Xperia Z. The happy ending will have the next Lumia flagship's name on it. Will you call this a good start? Some won't. But that doesn't make the Nokia X a bad phone for what it is.</paragraph>
