			<paragraph>LG managed to surprise us with almost a dozen of brand new handsets. While not all are high-end devices, each one has its own appeal, and we were eager to scour the LG booth for some quality time spent with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we proceed with the handsets, a little timeout is due with an enigmatic timepiece by LG. They presented a behind-the-glass teaser of their soon-to-be LG Watch phone. The teaser gadget is locked up and off limits to us, but at least we snatched a few shots of it. For what we?ve seen (no touch), it?s got a Shine-like navigation scroller, media player, touch screen (we guess) and, well, analog-style clock. But enough clever talk, check out those shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we continued our booth tour with the spanking novelty LG KF700 or otherwise known as LG Virgo - a multimedia slider, which stands out with its multiple control-and-navigation methods. The handset puts together a 3" touchscreen display, slide-out standard keypad and the novel Shortcut Dial at the back, which somehow resembles the LG Viewty's Jog in its functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF700 sports a full featured Web browser integrating Google Search, Blogs, Gmail, Maps and Youtube. HSDPA enhances web browsing and makes video calls possible. Other goodies include an MP3 player, MPEG4 video player, 3 megapixel camera with autofocus and image stabilizer, Bluetooth and microSD memory expansion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tri-band slider offers a 3" 262K-color touchscreen display with a resolution of 240 x 480 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video walkthrough of the LG KF700.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing we liked the best about it is that in terms of user interface speed and responsiveness it's way beyond what LG Viewty can offer. Otherwise the user interface is the same as the Viewty's but improved in graphically. The Home screen can now accomodate several widgets - beside Calendar and World clock, there is also a Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were dissapointed by the slider action - if you drag your finger downwards on the screen, the slider begins closing down, then when you let go, it goes back up and as a result all the downwards movements of your thumb along the screen create a jitter in the slider mechanism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disappointing thing is the side scrollwheel. The user interface reacts so slowly to the scrolling that we would go as far as blacklisting the scrollwheel as a viable navigation solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 will start selling in Europe towards the end of 1Q 2008, before it gets available in other markets.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG KF600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the European debut of the LG KF600 otherwise known as LG Venus. Its key feature is the InteractPad - a small touch-sensitive display beneath the main screen that is used for navigation, with context-specific virtual keys that change across applications. To enhance the user experience, the InteractPad is haptic-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the LG KF600 takes full advantage of the eight graphic themes designed by graffiti artists Keith Haring, that can remarkably change the look and feel of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the UI is certainly intriguing, the LG KF600 was a bit of a downer, as the much advertised InteractPad was not that responsive to our touch as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another serious disadvantage is that when you drag your finger along the touch-sensitive display, the upper slider part gives in as obviously there is no retention mechanism. It proves to be quite a nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF600 multimedia capabilities include a 3 megapixel camera, MP3 player, video recording and FM radio. The handset offers Bluetooth 2.0 and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video walkthrough of the KF600.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tri-band slider, with EDGE support but no HSDPA, features a 262K-color 2" QVGA display, the InteractPad is 1.5" 262K-color with a resolution of 240 x 176 pixels. The LG KF600 will be available in pastel pink, shiny pink, wine red and titan.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG KF510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slim LG KF510 is another attractive slider. At just 10.9 mm thickness, the stylish LG KF510 flaunts a metal frame with a special metal gradation paintjobs in Stardust Dark Gray or Sunset Red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featuring the Interactive Touch Lighting technology, the friendly handling of LG KF510 is on par with its attractive exterior. The key features include a 3 megapixel AF camera with flash, MP3 player, QVGA video recording and playback, FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video walkthrough of the LG KF510.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG KF510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tri-band handset offers EDGE, Bluetooth with A2DP, USB and a microSD card slot. The tempered-glass covered 2.2" 262K-color display supports QVGA resolution. The LG-KF510 will be available in March.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG KT610</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other announcements today was the LG KT610 - a Symbian S60 device offering a full QWERTY keyboard and taking after the form factor of the Nokia Communicator handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KT610 has a large 2.4-inch internal display and a tiny 1.45-inch external one. The QWERTY keyboard is complemented by an external alphanumeric keypad for convenient dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external keyboard has really large keys that should facilitate dialling. The LG KT610 has chrome trim all over that really makes a difference, as the black/greyish plastic is not the most stylish material we've seen. Strangely enough, the center of the large outside D-pad is not a confirming button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features that are accessible on the external display are Contacts, Calls log, Messages and Music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal QWERTY keyboard has large and spacey keys that are with nice tactile feedback. Navigating throughout the interface is easy thanks to the D-pad (this time WITH a confirming center).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KT610 has two opening positions - a 90-degree desktop one and a full 180-degree one for easy message typing on the go. The desktop position is also really comfortable for making video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standing at 17.2 mm thickness, the LG KT610 also has a 2 megapixel camera. Shooting with it though is extremely uncomfortable, as the lens is placed on the back panel. And in order to use the viewfinder, you need to have the device open. Now imagine taking pictures with the back cover of an open book. You will get the same awkward feeling we did get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KM500</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KM500 is a music-enabled slider pitched as a professional quality music phone with a 2 megapixel camera. It sports a 2-inch QVGA display, dedicated music keys and a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM500 comes with 1GB microSD memory card in the package and microSDHC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KM710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another music slider, LG KM710 runs on easy music control through the front Jog Wheel and music interactive display. The main display is a 2" QVGA one, while in place of the navigation D-pad there's a 128 x 128 pixels 1.1" touchscreen display with support for up to 65K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't know if there will be additional body colors but this white one is most definately as girly as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad/Jog Wheel combo is really interesting. You can use the Jog wheel to scroll through the menus, but you also get five-way navigation through pressing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select an item from the KM710 main menu it gets visualized on the color touch-sensitive screen in the center of the D-pad. The center of the D-pad is used for confirming or selecting items from the menu - it has haptic feedback and a fast response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short walkthrough video of the LG KM710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>
showVideo("http://cdn.gsmarena.com/vv/reviewsimg/mwc08-lg/video/", "lg-km710.flv", 426, 240);
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF310</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF310 is a browsing-centric slider with a 2 megapixel camera. It's UMTS-enabled and has a 2-inch display with a resolution of 220 x 176 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF310 comes complete with a Google package, which includes Google search, Google Maps and GMail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that's it for now at the LG camp. Stay tuned as we reveal more and hopefully grab some of those babies for a spin around the LG booth.</paragraph>
