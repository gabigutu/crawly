			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compact but capable, subdued but edgy, old but new. That?s the HTC Gratia. With Froyo greasing the cogs, the European version of the HTC Aria is more than a name change ? this petite droid is getting ready to storm the Old Continent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android world is in a stage where big screens make the grade, which makes it frustratingly hard for people who like their droid in a small package. The compact Gratia comes with a 3.2? screen and is noticeably smaller than competing phones with the same display diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on though, here?s the gist of what?s in store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the clean, simple lines, the Gratia is recognizable enough thanks to the signature screws on the back. Some might confuse it with the HD mini, which originated the look, but Android?s explosive popularity means that the Aria/Gratia phones have far surpassed their PocketPC cousin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have put their magic touch on the HTC Gratia interface ? the Sense UI is elegant and highly usable, with special focus on social networking. The speed boost from running Froyo rather than Eclair is a major advantage and Flash support in the browser is relatively rare in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gratia software is certainly one of the highlights but the hardware deserves praise as well. The phone is solidly built and feels sturdy in the hand, without being bulky or heavy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, enough warm up ? time to jump into the review. On the next page we start with opening the box and examining the contents. After that, our tour of the exterior begins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reasonable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes in a plain looking box with standard issue stuffing. There?s a microUSB cable in there, a one-piece headset and a very sleek charger. The microUSB cable is used for both data connections and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a 2GB microSD card to get you started ? if you want more storage, the HTC Gratia can handle up to 32GB cards. You?ll find the usual set of user guides too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Gratia 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Aria stands at 103.8 x 57.7 x 11.7 mm ? the exact dimensions of the Aria and the HD mini. The handset ranks well among other compact smartphones in terms of pocketability. The weight of 115 grams is a bit more than we expected, but combined with the screws and the seamless casing, it gives the impression of a rock solid phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gratia is the spitting image of the HTC Aria and that shouldn?t come as a surprise ? the Gratia is the European version, though it did see some changes other than the name (mostly in the software department rather than in hardware).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia is a rare thing ? a compact Android. While most other models are scrambling to get bigger and bigger displays, the Gratia stays focused on pocketability. Unlike the few other compact droids, the Gratia doesn?t compromise the screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the display is respectable for a compact phone ? some of the other 3.2? droids are often a whole centimeter taller than the Gratia. The HVGA resolution is also suitable for a 3.2? diagonal, though if you?re coming from a WVGA screen, you?ll notice the loss of sharpness and details right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the LCD screen on the Gratia looks quite nice ? it?s bright with good colors (not as good as OLED though) and the viewing angles are ok too. Sunlight legibility is not among the display?s strong points though: direct sunlight makes it very hard to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the front of the HTC Gratia comprise four capacitive keys and a clickable optical trackpad. The keys are the standard Android foursome ? home, menu, back and search. The optical trackpad is flush against the surface and you can use the added accuracy it gives to go back and correct typos. The trackpad has a confirming action too ? though we very rarely used it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC Gratia display is the earpiece dead center and a status LED to the left of it. It glows red while the phone is charging or blinks green in case of a missed event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right to it, you can see the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker, which works throughout the interface, controlling the ringing and system volumes. It?s well sized and solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is completely bare ? by now you probably know HTC aren?t too fond of putting camera shutter keys on their phones. Instead you?ll have to rely on continuous auto focus and the optical trackpad serving as a shutter key. There?s touch focus too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is at the bottom of the HTC Aria, right next to the lanyard eyelet and the microUSB port. There is no cover over the connectivity port to keep dust and moisture away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same holds true for the 3.5mm audio jack on top. It is placed on a sloping surface so the jacks you plug in will always slightly stick out even if they are properly connected. Also on top, sitting on the nice chrome accent is the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the HTC Gratia back is the deeply embedded camera lens and the speaker grill, which are placed on a chrome plate. There?s no flash, so low-light shots will be doubtful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other prominent feature rearside are the four screws in the corners. They look like they?re holding the back cover ? they aren?t really, but it?s enough to give it that rugged look. Once you pop off the back cover, you?ll notice that under the black cover is the matte yellow plastic of the inner body ? even the battery itself is yellow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the third phone with this design ? the HD mini, the Aria and now the Gratia. We kept hoping that the yellow would be more prominent in a variant of the basic design (combined with the screws it gives the phone the look of a power tool) but HTC designers have another concept obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you get over the color, under the hood you?ll find the SIM card compartment, the microSD card slot (ready to accommodate cards of up to 32GB) and the 1200 mAh battery. Despite its location under the rear cover, the microSD card is fully hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the battery cover for a moment ? it adds a good couple of millimeters to the width of the Aria. This is mostly due to the tapered edges, which give the illusion of a thinner phone, so it?s a fair trade-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia is powered by a 1200mAh Li-Ion battery, which is quoted at fifteen and days of standby (in 2G, a day and a half more in 3G) and 7 hours of talk time (in 2G, an hour less in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen size is one of the few things in gadgetry that can?t ever be big enough. But all mobile devices run into the same roadblock ? they do indeed have to be mobile. The neat and small HTC Gratia will easily slip into any pocket ? even in the summer, when pocket space is scarce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the screen is probably the biggest that could possibly fit on the small face of the Gratia ? there?s very little bezel. Overall, keeping the size within limits was a top priority when the phone was designed, and the end result is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact dimensions, combined with the tapered edges, make the HTC Gratia perfect to handle. The lines are clean and simple but those four screws on the back make all the difference ? it looks like a rugged trustworthy tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And last but not least, we were pleased to see that the matte plastic at the rear is great at keeping forensic evidence like fingerprints to itself. The glossy-backed Aria literally had to be wiped clean every time you got it out of your pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI graces Android Froyo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia runs Android 2.2 Froyo out of the box ? no longer the latest and greatest Android OS out there but with the addition of Sense UI you still get above-average droid experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the UI is exactly the same as the one on the previously reviewed HTC Desire HD and Desire Z, we?ll reuse portions of the text but you should rest assured that we?ve reflected any differences in the user experience throughout the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?ve probably seen Sense UI many times before, but here it is running on the HTC Gratia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gratia has the Leap view option: tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. You can?t rearrange the homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreens is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense UI offers Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes are selected from a drop down menu and they are fixed ? any changes you make can be saved as a new Scene but you can?t modify existing scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between Scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical icon grid layout, but you can switch to a list. In the list layout, there?s an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster. It?s similar to what you used to see in TouchFLO on older HTC WinMo phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes and wallpapers) and for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (HTC and Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreens short. You can download new widgets by tapping the ?Get more HTC widgets? button or from the Android Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. The Twitter widget for instance ? one version shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet, while the other version is more compact but is for tweeting only. There's nothing stopping you from using both, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is the same as on older phones ? the Desire HD and Desire Z came with a recent apps list on the top of the notification area but there?s no such thing with the HTC Gratia, not even power toggles for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that the two new Desire phones enjoyed but it missing from the Gratia is HTC?s magically fast boot. Still, mobile phones are rarely powered on and off so that?s not a huge loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTCSense.com integration is missing too ? that is reserved only for HTC?s new phones (and the Gratia doesn?t quite qualify).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Froyo is really important for app performance ? the two benchmarks we tried show almost a two-fold performance compared to an Eclair-running Aria (with pretty much the same hardware). It even managed to outperform the LG Optimus One P500, which runs Froyo on the same CPU. We?re guessing its software wasn?t set up as well as the Gratia one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook loves to socialize<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia features HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with heavy social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just he first tab ? the other tabs hold other categories of info and communication methods, like emails or a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it used conversation style view, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what really turn the Gratia into a powerful networking tool. The first lists recent events and updates by a contact from all the networks you?ve linked to that contact. The second tab displays the contact?s online albums from Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your friends? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of each essential field but you can easily add more fields, including other fields in case you want to write down every last scrap of info you have on a contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is feature-rich, includes Smart Dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound quality of the HTC Gratia is crisp and loud and the signal reception was strong and trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia has Smart Dialing. Voice dialing is here too ? just press and hold the search key and say, for example, ?Call Dexter?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, turn-to-mute also works like a charm. You can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down. Another feature that works thanks to the accelerometer is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another really helpful feature is that the phone will vibrate once your call connects ? but only if the phone isn't at your ear (as detected by the proximity sensor). We?ve seen a similar feature before, but it would always vibrate making it more annoying than useful. This though comes in handy very often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Gratia fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored an Excellent mark, making the petite smartphone one of the loudest we've tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging powerhouse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia is well equipped for all kinds of text messaging ? it can handle all standard types of messages like SMS, MMS and email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages use the threaded layout ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the time of the last message, including a part of the actual note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses contact photos too (yours and the contact?s photo), so the whole thing looks almost the same as a chat app. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection lacks the magnifying glass feature we?ve seen on other phones, so you might have to use the optical trackpad to get the necessary precision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input method that the Gratia offers is an on-screen QWERTY ? Android?s keyboard is one of the best on-screen keyboards around but the small size of the screen is limiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard does take up half of the screen but for longer texts you?ll want to go with the landscape version. It?s easier to type on though the keys are close together, which leads to the occasional typo. The autocomplete and spelling correction features go along way in eliminating this problem though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email has a combined inbox<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app, which looks the same as usual, and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been slightly tweaked up too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the current email account and of course the actual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, there are several tabs that can filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. The option to only display emails with attached files is a good one to have on hand (they are not automatically loaded by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually but not all together (we?ve seen this option on some HTCs but it?s missing here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Gratia lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual main menu list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery undertakes re-indexing of the content each time you access it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. And that's a bugger as when cards are full of content, it's quite slow to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a figure indicating the number of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has only one shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three tabs ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, finally, Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images, share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa, and delete the current image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Gratia image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip layout. You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy and paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Gratia supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of this while browsing your images. Zooming in and out is done in the same fashion as on the Apple iPhone. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is very smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MP4/3GP-only video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums subfolder as there is no separate icon for the video player in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared over Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application on the HTC Gratia is quite basic. There?s a full screen mode, where the clip gets stretched / cropped to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite as expected, the player is capable of playing only 3GP and MP4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the go HTC Gratia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aria handled all of the MP4 files we threw at it with ease: no dropped frames or out-of-sync audio. Videos with VGA resolution played well, we even managed to get a 800x480 video playing (though its bitrate wasn?t very high).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player dates all the way back to the HTC Legend. The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer new features. Swiping between songs in the now playing screen has a cool 3D effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find no contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff on YouTube or Google. The other music player weaknesses of the Android platform still need addressing too ? no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio starts slowly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling between them. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback. It?s a little slow to start though ? it takes 5-6 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are pleased to note that the HTC Gratia did very well in our audio quality test. It achieved some excellent scores when you use it as an audio source for external amplifiers (such as a car or home stereo), rivaling some of the best handsets we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And things aren't much worse when you plug in a pair of headphones. As usual the stereo crosstalk and the intermodulation distortion increase, but still remain respectable. The dynamic range is also slightly affected but the deviations are still mostly detectable in lab conditions. And we give the Gratia an extra point, because it's pretty loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1952 pixels. It doesn?t have any assistance from a flash, not even a dedicated shutter key to make snapping photos easier. The job of a shutter button is reserved fro the touch-sensitive pad below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface isn?t the ultimate in user-friendliness, with most of the options sitting on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder. It can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get shortcuts to exposure compensation and the camera album right in the viewfinder but that?s all. From the extended menu you have some more controls to play with ? brightness, contrast/saturation/sharpness dials, color effects along with white balance, ISO and metering mode controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gratia camera supports geo-tagging photos as well as face detection. There?s no smile or blink detection. Finally, there?s an option to shoot photos in the wider 3:2 aspect ratio, which expands the viewfinder to the whole screen at the cost of some vertical resolution. If that option is off, there are two black bars on the left and right of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual shooting isn?t quite as comfortable as we would?ve like, mostly because the small optical trackpad is flush against the front face of the Gratia and doesn?t make for a very good shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous auto-focus seems to take its time ? each time you re-frame you have to wait a bit longer than we?d expect for the device to focus. Touch focus on the other hand seems to work well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia camera is somewhat of a disappointment. The camera unit seems defective.It's probably a faulty lens to blame here ? photos are very soft, with almost no fine detail. The issue is less pronounced at closer differences as you'll see in the photo compare tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the color rendering and contrast are good but there?s a fair amount of noise visible too. Oversharpening is also quite visible in our studio shots of the test charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the HTC Gratia to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video at lower FPS than expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Gratia shoots VGA resolution video, like the Aria, but we notices something strange. While the Aria almost managed 30fps (it hovered around 29fps), the Gratia struggled to make it to 20fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video won?t win any awards even if you ignore the frame rate ? the HTC Gratia produces relatively low-bitrate 3GP videos with noticable compression artifacts and little fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, encoding type and recording limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image settings go, you get exposure compensation, contrast, saturation and sharpness, as well as color effects and white balance settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample VGA@20fps video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well-geared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE to ensure voice and data connectivity when travelling abroad and a dual-band 3G plus HSDPA (7.2Mbps downlink, 2Mbps uplink) with European bands (it is a European phone after all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity is standard ? Wi-Fi b/g and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you connect the Gratia with a computer over the microUSB cable you get the following list of options: Charge only, Disk drive (connects the microSD card as a mass storage drive), HTC Sync for connecting to HTC?s PC suite and USB tethering, which shares the phone?s data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 comes with Wi-Fi hotspot functionality built-in. The HTC Gratia supports up to 8 connections and you can encrypt the connection (for security and to avoid freeloaders).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick the encryption method (WEP, WPA, WPA2), select the Wi-Fi channel to use and there?s a helpful auto power-off, which can turn off the hotspot after a preset period of inactivity (5 or 10 minutes).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great Flash-capable web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid web browsing has been an inherent part of the Android deal since day one but the Froyo web browser is one of the best in the mobile world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. With pinch-zooming enabled you don?t even need the +/- zoom buttons that we have seen on most other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is docked at the top of the page so you can scroll down and get it out of the way too. However you don?t need to scroll to the top every time you want to tap a new address ? just press the menu button and bring it up anywhere on the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gratia browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which make it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to further sweeten the deal, HTC Gratia has Flash support in its web browser. The performance is far from spectacular but it?s better than nothing. You should definitely pick simpler Flash games, but it?s good at least those run just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash video support is also dodgy enough with the Gratia failing to open the Vimeo and Metacafe videos that we tried. YouTube works fine but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application so it doesn?t really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but since that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm we won?t be crediting it with extra point on that account.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A fine organizer on board, office doc reader too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes with the usual set of organizing apps. It also has a preinstalled document viewer, which handles office files just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s the Quickoffice app, which has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For editing, you will need to get the paid app though. There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Gratia into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the Gratia with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which allow you to update your profiles on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can read your friends? updates in the People app but the full-blown Facebook app offers more features. You can update your profile, browser other people profiles and view news feeds, events, messages and friend requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Peep integrates with the phonebook, so you can read your friends? tweets from there, no need to launch the app. The app is quite capable ? it has handy shortcuts to snap a photo to send along wit the tweet (it automatically uploads it to either Twitpic or Twitgoo) and to add geo-tagging info to your message. The app will also automatically shorten links (using TinyURL or is.gd).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation without voice-guidance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes with a capable built-in GPS receiver. It managed a satellite lock in under two minutes without A-GPS on, which is pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the Aria as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is still only available in select countries though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it?s better than nothing but you have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. At least, pinch-zooming is available here as well so on-screen controls and double-tap zooming won?t be your only zooming options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Street View mode is supported in Google Maps and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps. It gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t an alternative navigation app preinstalled, so if you want one you?ll have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you were hoping for the free SatNav software ? HTC Locations ? you?ll be disappointed. The Android Market has alternatives of course (both free and paid) but Locations is a premium app that would have really elevated the HTC Gratia status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Gratia comes with the Car Panel app which offers big, easy to hit buttons so that you don?t get too distracted while driving. A handy option is ?mark this location? ? great for those who often forget where they parked their car.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market updated, looks much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gratia comes with a HVGA screen and Android Froyo, so the number of incompatible apps is very low. You get access to over a hundred thousand apps, many of which are well-made and very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? a carousel of featured apps on top and below them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top element is the major change in the Market. It sure is eye-catching but also takes up a lot of space. Also it?s a little redundant ? it?s a featured list of apps, below which is another featured list. Luckily, once you get down to the individual sections of the Market, the carousel disappears replenishing the screen space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app detail pages have been redesigned as well and usability has improved. The install button has been moved to the top ? the button is fairly big and prominent and it states the if the app is free or how much it costs otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that there was ever a big confusion about which apps are free (especially if you browse the Top Free section where it?s nothing but free apps). Installing an app has been streamlined though, so the update is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and with the most vital ones covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Market isn't augmented by the HTC Likes and HTC Hub apps, which provided yet more content (and interesting ways to access it). Those two are exclusive to the Desire HD and Desire Z for now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had high hopes for the HTC Gratia ? but in the end, the impression it left on us wasn?t as good compared to the Aria from a few months back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We thought that the update to Froyo would bring more goodies than it did ? the Gratia runs almost the same software as the 2.1 Éclair-powered Aria and a lot of it needs a new paint job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the speed boost and Wi-Fi hotspot support are welcome additions. We can?t expect a sea change anyway. The HTC Gratia is just a localized version of an old phone, a Europe-bound remake of the HTC Aria.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the HTC Gratia is a great little phone and the one thing that can hold it back from taking over the old continent is only its pricetag. It?s a pricy little droid and while it can beat some of the competition, the situation isn't exactly rosy for our little Gratia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Chic E720 is cheaper still and it?s slightly ahead of the Gratia (on paper at least). It?s bulkier but again, much more affordable. The LG Optimus One P500 also fits the bill, coming in just below the Chic (the lower-res camera is the main difference) at a slightly lower price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Optimus Chic E720 ? LG Optimus One P500 ? Motorola DEFY ? Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Gratia price range are also phones like the rugged Motorola DEFY - water and dust resistant, with a 3.7? FWVGA screen, faster CPU, LED flash. The steel-clad Nokia C6-01 may not run the most exciting OS, but has a couple of aces up its sleeve ? excellent high-res display, 720p video and a few other tidbits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A metal casing is important to some (it is to us) ? if you?re one of those, you?ll want to look at the HTC Legend. Very similar to the Gratia featurewise, the Legend has a sleek aluminum unibody and looks great (especially the black version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Legend ? Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 ? Samsung S7230E Wave 723.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 is surprisingly capable for a mid-ranger with Bluetooth 3.0 and Wi-Fi b/g/n on board. The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is a mid-range Bada ? Bada has yet to gain Android-levels of popularity, but it?s a new thing to try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the HTC Gratia is one of the best compact droids around ? but it?s not a cheap date. If you can afford it, this mid-ranger will keep you happy but you need to discuss things with your wallet first before you head out to the store ? saving up a little extra and going for the high-end might just be an option worth considering.</paragraph>
