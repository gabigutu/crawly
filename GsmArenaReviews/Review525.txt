			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>How times have changed - it was not that long ago that you could hardly get a feature phone for $150, and these days this amount gets you a ridiculously good smartphone like the Lenovo K3 Note. It's an affordable large-screen phablet with little compromise on the important stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the 5.5-inch FullHD display, the K3 Note doesn't sacrifice resolution for display diagonal. It's the diagonal that makes the buzz, but you're staring at those pixels all day, so there better be enough of them, that you can't see individual ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Mediatek chipset in the Snapdragon 615 class, 2GB of RAM, and Lollipop have you well-covered and future-proofed for a while. Add to that a 13MP primary camera with a dual LED flash and a 5MP front snapper, and there's nothing to leave you wanting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build isn't top-shelf grade, but the plastics used are soft and pleasant to touch, and the Laser Yellow color scheme is as fresh as they come. The best part is that the battery is removable, a feature we're still trying to advocate, though manufacturers see things differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a very competitive segment the Lenovo K3 Note is forced to fight in. The large-screen device on a budget has turned into a lucrative niche for many manufacturers and solid offerings with increasingly better hardware have been put out by big-name Chinese manufacturers, not to mention the countless other makers most of us haven't heard of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note was among the pioneers in the category and was recently inherited by the Redmi Note 2 with even more powerful innards. Meanwhile, the m2 note is Meizu's second iteration on the subject of the affordable phablet and it too poses philosophical questions as to what is the point of owning a flagship smartphone costing hundreds of dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those two are the K3 Note's main rivals, though admittedly it does have a head start on them by a couple of months. The established players outside of China are hard pressed to offer true competitors at this price point and are forced to sacrifice a thing or two (or several), be it display resolution, processing power, camera, or build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get ahead of ourselves and leave comparisons for when we've acquainted ourselves better with the Lenovo K3 Note. Join us on the next page for the unboxing and hardware overview.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note comes in an understated retail box, with nothing but the bare necessities inside. There's a powerful 5.2V/2A AC adapter and a USB cable, but headphones are missing. There are however, bundles, which include a headset for a small increase in price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo K3 Note 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note measures 152.6 x 76.2 x 8.0mm and its dimensions are nearly identical to those of the Meizu m2 note and the Xiaomi Redmi 2. Weighing in at 150g, the Lenovo phablet is a gram heavier than the m2 note, but 10g lighter than the Redmi 2, and the Xiaomi model does feel tangibly heavier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outside of the budget segment 5.5-inch devices, 150g is the low point. Yes, the LG G3 is 149g but the Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML is heftier at 170g and the OnePlus 2 adds another 5g on top of that. The brand new Motorola Moto X Play tips the scale at 169g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A plastic-built smartphone with a removable back cover is something hard to find in the upper market segment (the LG G4 would beg to differ), but around the $150 price point of the Lenovo K3 Note it's the norm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's quite well put together and feels sturdy, though there's the occasional creek coming out of it, should you test its twisting stiffness. It's also somewhat light for its dimensions and gives out a minor hollow vibe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bright yellow paint job is certainly a head-turner, but you can also opt for the more inconspicuous white one, or the entirely unremarkable black version. We'd stick with Laser Yellow, as it gives character to an otherwise run-of-the-mill device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cover itself is easy to remove, without being prone to falling off on its own. Also, spare covers are available online for less than $5, and, being a hugely popular model, the K3 Note enjoys a wide variety of aftermarket accessory cases and backs, so you can spice things up to your heart's content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of stuff on the back, most notably the camera module in the top left corner. The lens is slightly recessed inside the cutout in the cover, so it should be pretty safe. Lenovo hasn't unnecessarily enlarged the front element of the lens as it's all too common, and the camera only takes up as much space as required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below the camera is the dual-LED flash. On the right is the pinhole for the secondary mic joined by the loudspeaker, which is in a somewhat unusual position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop open the cover and you see the battery, which is spread onto a large area, but is very thin. The two SIM slots take micro-SIM cards and one is limited to 2G, while the other gets the full connectivity suite. There's also a dedicated microSD slot, which is getting rare in these days of hybrid second SIM/microSD solutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is where it gets "noname" pretty quickly. Looking at the smartphone head on (the generally accepted manner, when using it) you'd be hard pressed to tell what make it is. The Redmi Note 2, for one, looks nigh identical, though Xiaomi did give its capacitive buttons a distinct red color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K3 Note still uses the old concept with a context menu button next to the home and back buttons below the display. Above it are the earpiece, front-facing camera and proximity/ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the K3 Note you'll find the volume rocker and the power button. They have a nice metallic effect with concentric circles spreading out from the middle. The buttons are attached to the cover, and engage tinier keys inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is entirely bare - remember, all slots are under the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has this perplexing practice to place the microUSB port on the top of its budget smartphones, and the K3 Note is one of those. With the battery contacts in the top half of the device, it makes sense to keep the wiring shorter, but it's just plain unnatural. The 3.5mm headphone jack is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the microUSB port up top, the bottom is only home to the primary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In hand the Lenovo K3 Note feels lighter than you'd think, and the back has just enough texture for a secure grip. The buttons are where you'd expect them to be, within easy reach of your right thumb. Lefties will find them equally well positioned for index finger operation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sharp and high-contrast 5.5-inch LCD, a bit dim though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A key feature for the K3 Note's breed is the FullHD 5.5-inch display. Sure, there are plenty of inexpensive large-screen smartphones, but resolution is typically the first victim to budget cuts. The K3 Note, along with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 and Meizu m2 note (the m1 note, too) are the most prominent of the select few, which prove that it doesn't have to be so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an IPS panel with 401ppi density and a standard RGB arrangement, as our microscope shot reveals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is fairly accurate (Avg deltaE 6.2 for the primary colors plus black and white), with white being not as accurate as we would expect. With a deltaE of 11.4, it's on the colder bluish side, but you would hardly notice that unless you get some sort of a reference to compare it side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, display colors are a matter of personal taste and perception so if you don't need calibrated color output, you will probably be quite happy with the color rendition on the Lenovo K3 Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no options for fine tuning the color rendering or the white point temperature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum display brightness of the Lenovo K3 Note may not turn any heads (432nits), but you'd be surprised that when it comes to contrast ratio, it scored the second highest contrast ratio we've ever measured on a phone (1793:1). In case you're curious, the highest contrast ratio belongs to the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (1819:1). The amazing result can be attributed to the deep black levels, which are frankly, class leading for an LCD unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note is not particularly rich in connectivity options, but it has all the basics covered. It's a dual-SIM dual-standby device, and one card gets the complete 2G/3G/4G treatment, while the other is limited to 2G. Both slots take microSIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Wi-Fi b/g/n in the 2.4GHz spectrum only, with hotspot support. Bluetooth comes in version 4.1, where LTE interference issues have been dealt with. There's also GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS support. An FM radio receiver is also on board, though it lacks RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connectivity is handled by the microUSB 2.0 port, and USB OTG is supported so you can attach storage or peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm jack lets you attach headphones of your choice (which you'd need to buy separately anyway, in most cases).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo K3 Note battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note comes with a 3,000mAh battery, and as we've already established it's removable. The capacity is marginally smaller than what the m2 note (3,100mAh) and Redmi Note 2 (3,060mAh) are packing, but the difference is too small to really matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What does matter is test results and the unfortunate reality is that the K3 Note's aren't impressive. Around 6 hours of web browsing is a mediocre result, and an hour more of video playback doesn't help. The 17 hours of 3G calls are an okay result, but with such an ample battery, you'd expect more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that adds up to an endurance rating of 53 hours, which is on the short side. At least with the K3 Note you can have a spare battery on hand for instant 100%, if that's any consolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For comparison sake, the Meizu m2 note does 21 hours of calls and 10 full hours on the web, though it does score poorly in the video playback department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Heavily retouched Android 5.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note comes with Android 5.0 on board with a proprietary skin on top. Skin might be a too mild term though, as the interface is thoroughly reworked and Material design is nowhere to be found. Lenovo calls it Vibe OS, but unlike other manufacturers who are keen on stamping the name of their home-brewed overlay here and there, the K3 Note remains mum on the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying, that the interface is inspired by iOS in more ways than one, that's the way far-East makers do it. The lockscreen isn't necessarily one of those elements. The default layout consists of a clock widget with a date, and the operator name, which you can opt to hide. You can also display the owner's name, but it's a free text field, so you could type a motivational quote if that's your thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlocking works with an upward swipe, but you also get shortcuts to the dialer and camera. Their icon positioning in the bottom corners is nothing but a reminder, as you access those apps by side swipes form anywhere on the screen, not necessarily from the corners. You can also access the quick toggles straight from the lockscreen, but not the notifications, and you don't get the Lollipop style lockscreen notifications either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, all that applies to the lockscreen of the pre-applied theme. It's an entirely customizable affair and different themes can have their own arrangement of the above elements, but also omit some altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes come in all shapes and colors and have control on functionality, aside from looks. With the Windows XP theme, for example, you can only unlock the phone by swiping the power icon towards the Windows logo, and you get no additional shortcuts. Other themes offer you to swipe outwards from the center in one of three directions, each launching a different app or just unlocking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the absence of an app drawer, the homescreens are where all your apps reside, and you can have a practically unlimited number of homescreens (okay, 18, but what would possess you to use all is beyond us). New ones can be added with ease, existing ones can be rearranged and an arbitrary one can be set as home-home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have the wallpaper remain stationary of scroll with the homescreens (must be wider than 1080 pixels), screen transition effects can be selected, and you can choose whether to be able to cycle back to the first one after reaching the end or not. Once you get it all set up to your liking, you can lock the layout so you don't mess it up accidentally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nifty feature lets you assign one of four functions to each of three homescreen gestures. By default swiping up from an empty are pops up a num-pad keyboard that lets you search for apps smart-dial style, really handy if you do populate those 18 homescreens with apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping down from an empty area can save you the trouble for reaching all the way up to the notification shade, and a double tap is best suited to locking the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth function opens the settings menu, you'd otherwise evoke by tapping the left capacitive button, so it's somewhat redundant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification shade works in a familiar fashion. Pull down once with one finger, and you get notifications only, pull down a second time and you get the entire list of quick toggles, with notifications squished below. A two-finger pull takes you straight to that state. There's no priority row of toggles that gets opened every time, it's none or all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is one of the more iOS-looking elements in the K3 Note's interface. It's evoked with a long press on the home button and displays a side-scrollable list of app thumbnails with their respective icons below. Swiping up closes the app, swiping down locks it, so that you don't close it when you use the "Kill all" button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>"True octa-core" is what Mediatek likes to call the architecture of the chipset inside the Lenovo K3 Note. The MT6752 is a rather common SoC in midrange devices on a budget, and can be found in vivo and Meizu offerings as well as more affordable HTC and Sony models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU relies on eight Cortex-A53 cores, which can peak as high as 1.7GHz, all of them simultaneously, when the task at hand requires top performance. The MT6752 is then bound to excel at CPU tasks, especially ones that can make full use of multiple processor cores. The main competing chipset - the Snapdragon 615, should be left behind in such cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is 2GB of RAM on board, and while we've been getting spoiled by an increasing number of midrangers sporting 3GB of RAM, two gigs are more than enough at this price point. The GPU inside is Mali-T760 MP2, clocked at up to 700MHz, which typically makes for a satisfactory performance on a 1080p display. Which is about as much as could be said of the Adreno 405.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start off with Geekbench 3 and the octa-core CPU is quick to show its strength. The MT6795 (or Helio X10, but we prefer meaningless alphanumeric strings) inside the Xiaomi Redmi 2 pulls ahead thanks to the higher clock rate of its otherwise identical processor cores. Another MT6752 device, the Sony Xperia C4 Dual performs slightly better than the K3 Note, and the Meizu m1 is right behind the Note's back, but other than those three, the K3 Note has little competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 615 representatives Xiaomi Mi 4i and Galaxy A7 (not really a competitor given its price) show significantly lower scores. The Galaxy J7 with its Exynos 7580 does better, but still trails behind the Lenovo phablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a similar story in Antutu, but here it's the MT6595-packing Meizu MX4 and Lenovo Vibe X2 that lead the way. The K3 Note is on par with the Xperia C4 Dual and Redmi Note 2, comfortably ahead of all competition, both MT6752 and Snapdragon 615.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark OS II 2.0, which is another compound benchmark, where the K3 note flies high. Only the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 scores higher in the overall result, but it is Mediatek's top-dog inside that one. The Xperia C4 Dual gets the closest to the K3 Note, The Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) does an okay job to defend the S615 camp, which the Mi 4i tries hard to embarrass.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi 5-iincher then redeems itself in the single-core portion of the benchmark, where it places second to the Redmi Note 2 (clearly, an all-round favorite). The K3 Note is a close third but more importantly ahead of any rivals, be they Mediatek- or Qualcomm-powered. Which leads us to the multi-core test, where the Lenovo K3 Note takes the lead, even outpacing the Redmi Note 2 and its Helio X10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excitement quiets down when we examine the graphics performance, though it's certainly not disappointing for the combination of GPU and display resolution. On the contrary, the K3 Note places towards the top in Basemark X, only behind the MT6595 and MT6795 and their PowerVR6200. The Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) is the closest-ranked Adreno 405, while the Galaxy J7 is even further down with its Mali-T720 MP2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GFXBench gives a more detailed representation of what you can expect in an actual gaming environment. For one, the Lenovo K3 Note posts identical scores in the onscreen and offscreen tests, which is to be expected since the resolution is 1080p in both, but we've seen anomalies in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's little here to split the MT6752 and Snapdragon 615 crowd here. 15 fps in the T-Rex portion of the benchmark is an average result, though the Mi 4i manages to underdeliver and only does 14.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more intense Manhattan test sees the fps count drop to 6.1 for the K3 Note and here the differences are marginal as well. The Redmi Note 2 is consistently towards the top, and the few 720p displays in the chart give the respective phones a boost due to the lower pixel count, but other than that it's a close call between the Adreno 405 and the Mali-T760 MP2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browser performance is another excellent area in the K3 Note's benchmark scorecard. While the Lenovo Vibe X2 is in a class of its own in Kraken 1.1, the Lenovo K3 Note is the best among the midrange chipsets at munching on JavaScript.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 615 only reminds of its existence in Browsermark 2.1, where the Galaxy A7 is second to the Vibe X2, followed closely by the K3 Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also worth noting that we ran all tests with the pre-installed browser. We then installed Chrome, as it often yields better results, but on the K3 Note it scored significantly worse. So it speed is what you're after, the built-in in browser is the way to go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, the Lenovo K3 Note is an excellent all-round performer all in itself, but even more so when you factor in its asking price. Offerings with competing hardware can come with a price tag 2 to 3 times higher and still trail behind it in benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Custom phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note has a fully custom phonebook. It is laid out across four tabs: dialer, call log, contacts, and YellowPage, which may only be of use if you're in China. The contacts tab is further split between All, Groups and Favorites, which are selected from a drop-down menu up top. You can also search for contacts or filter them by their first letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing and editing a single contact is straightforward. As on most Android launchers, you can assign a plethora of contact information including custom ringtones and images, and you can enter a practically unlimited number of fields per contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any issues with the quality of the calls we placed with the K3 Note. The volume control allows for a wide range of settings and you'd rarely be forced to go for maximum. Reception was just fine, we didn't experience dropped calls or interuptions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K3 Note is a dual SIM device (both micro SIMs) and as such has settings for SIM handling. Each card can be assigned a name and a number, and cards can be disabled from the menu, so you don't have to physically remove them, if for some reason you don't want to use one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can select default cards to use for voice calls, messaging and data, or have the phone ask you eacu time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer displays an aggregate list of recent calls, for a categorized view you need to go to the call log. Smart dialing is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note posted a Good score in our customary loudspeaker test. That's much better thatn the Galaxy J7's below average rating and also ahead of the Meizu m2 note. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 is on par. Here's how the numbers stack up:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, there's a built-in generic app, which can sync with a whole bunch of Chinese mail services, but also Gmail and POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note employs the stock Android keyboard, which many users like. You can enhance it even further by turning on the Gesture typing. A cool little feature is that you can use the volume rocker to move the cursor left or right when you're in a text box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of the K3 Note is a very basic one with no bells and whistles. It can either show all of your photos organized by date or a list of your albums. Tapping on a photo shows it in full screen. Sadly, you can't resize thumbnails using the pinch zoom gesture. Another missing feature is any form of gallery sorting. Whereas many rivals allow you to sort by folders, favorites, people faces or location, that's no possible on the K3 Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are security popups when you try to jump between apps throughout the interface, here's one when trying to access the camera from the gallery. Thankfully, you can dismiss them for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single image, you get options for sharing and basic editing. Cropping is the most advanced manipulation though, the others are color filters and frames. A few special effects and funny decorations complete the picture and reiterate the editor's social media focus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The K3 Note doesn't really have a dedicated video player. You access the videos from within the gallery. It did play all sorts of files we threw at it though, DivX, XviD, MP4, WMV, but also MOVs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is a whole different affair. It's as packed with features, as the gallery and video player are bare. The library is pretty standard-issue, and can be sorted by artists, folders or songs. You can also easily search for your song of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface shows the album art in a circle on a blurred background. Swiping to the left opens up artist information (in Chinese), while swiping to the right gives access to the song's lyrics. Timing can be adjusted, and you can select the color of the current verse. While playing a song the lockscreen displays the album art too and provides basic controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then come the online services that the K3 Note offers. You get access to charts, radios and artist profiles, all in Chinese of course. There's also a song recognition service, but it didn't recognize Sting's Fragile, so it may well be Chinese-specific too. You get settings for sound effects too with a dozen presets and custom effects. A sleep timer up to 90 minutes is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K3 Note comes with an FM radio receiver. It lacks RDS so you'll need to enter station names manually. You can assign favorites and record off the radio, and you can play through the loudspeaker, but you need to have the headset plugged in so serve as the antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera produces soft output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note features a 13MP camera with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels in its native 4:3 mode. The lens has an f/2.0 aperture. A dual-LED flash is present but there are no niceties in the line of OIS and phase detection/laser autofocus, not that you'd expect at the price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Lenovo K3 Note camera is friendly and logically laid out. On the top left you get four shortcuts (front/rear camera switch, flash mode selector, HDR toggle and shutter release mode). The settings menu is accessed via a dedicated shortcut in the bottom left corner, which brings up a tabbed interface with tabs for stills, video and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has provided the basic shooting modes - there's Normal, Panorama and Effects, but also a QR reader. There are no downloadable modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is decent, but far from spectacular. Pleasing colors with a bit of warmth and dependable exposure are trying hard to make up for the limited dynamic range, which often leaves large areas in the shadows solid black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger issue is that the amount of resolved detail is not on par with other 13MP shooters. Foliage ends up rendered like a water-colored blob of green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the reality of its price tag though, and you realize that the K3 Note shoots adequate images for sharing on social media and making album-sized prints - both areas where per-pixel detail is not a top priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode brings out the shadows, but also brightens up the entire image, save for the extreme highlights. The results are believable, not overly dramatic and pleasant overall. Not having much detail to begin with, the HDR shots have some more of it smeared in the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode is among the worse we've seen. Not only is it limited in resolution to some 1200 pixels in height, but also does a terrible job at stitching. Add to that the variations in exposure and you could go as far as calling the K3 Note's panoramas unusable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K3 Note has a 5MP front-facing camera. It has a nifty trick - it automatically takes a photo when you wave, make the "peace" sign or blink in order to reduce shaking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It captures nice selfies with a lot of detail for a front cam, accurate skin tones, and correct exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Lenovo K3 Note and here's how it fared, compared against the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 and Meizu m2 note. Of course, our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video with average quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note offers 1080p videos at 30 frames per second in addition to 720p videos, but skimps on fancier options for fast- or slow-motion capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not a whole lot you can adjust in terms of video settings. You can set the focus to infinite or continuous as well as toggle the digital video stabilization. That's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it happens with shared camera interfaces, you can't properly frame your video until you actually start recording. That's a pointless push for simplicity, which brings no practical benefit to the user, but is ubiquitous, so the K3 Note is not alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos taken with the Lenovo K3 Note can be described like its still images. Soft overall, low on detail and narrow in dynamic range. On the positive side, the continuous focusing did a good job and exposure was also consistent. Videos have an average bitrate of 17Mbps and their stereo audio track is encoded in 128Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can check out our video comparison tool to see how the 1080p videos differ in resolution, color rendition and more. You can also compare the Lenovo K3 Note to any of the numerous phones and tablets we've tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo K3 Note comes with a custom built-in browser, which is apparently developed by Ask.com. Despite the fact that the phone does come with the Google Play store pre-installed, Chrome wasn't part of the bundle, and neither was Drive, though you can always download those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the one actually on board. It has all the features you might want in a mobile browser. You can import bookmarks, you can use incognito mode, the search engine is set to Google. You do lose the multi device synchronization that Chrome offers you, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SafeCenter is Lenovo's take on a system-wide phone manager. It lets you clear RAM and storage, monitor data usage, set app permissions and block spam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the only app that claims to optimize your K3 Note, there's two more. DU Speed Booster/Cache Cleaner is one and adds antivirus protection, connection speeds measurements and battery saving features. Clean Master is the other and it does pretty much the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just that having three optimization apps doesn't appear all that optimal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a cool looking File manager. It lets you access internal memory and sorts your files into neat categories. You can perform cut, copy and paste operations too, with batches supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar on board the K3 Note is a custom job as well, and a peculiar one at that. It defaults to a month view and lacks week/year views. Adding an event is as simple as on any other device and birthdays are separate from reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a nice clock app with alarms, multi zone clocks, stopwatch with lap timing, and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a simplistic but stylish compass, which can also display your GPS coordinates, and also features a bubble-like level. A sound recorder is present too, with three quality settings. The calculator goes into scientific mode when you rotate the phone in landscape orientation, but the switch can also be forced with a button, for those who like to keep the auto-rotation off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo K3 Note key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Simple, no-nonsense design, sturdy build, removable back</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharp display with deep blacks and class-leading contrast for an LCD, not very bright though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is a bit of a letdown - 53h battery endurance rating is only average. The user-swappable battery is a potential workaround.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather typical Chinese Android overlay - single-tier, colorful, customizable, with theming support and an iOS vibe, in this case based on 5.0 Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent benchmark scores, solid overall and CPU performance, decent graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker scores a Good rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very basic gallery app, little editing possible in-phone; no standalone video player, but wide codec support; music player has plenty of features though, but most require a Lenovo account</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Soft output from the main camera on pixel level, narrow dynamic range, but consistent exposure and good colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are lacking in detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good selfie cam, detailed images with realistic skin tones</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note5 costs in the whereabouts of $750-$800. The Lenovo K3 Note is about one fifth of that. Is the Galaxy Note5 five times better? We'll leave that question for you to ponder, and stick to the K3 Note - a phablet for the masses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't have a metal unibody or a fancy dual-glass design, it's made of plastic. And it's not ashamed of it, instead it's eager to show off in bright yellow attire. It's a well-built device that doesn't feel cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Championing the use of 1080p resolution in the ultra-affordable phablet segment, the K3 Note's display is one of its key selling points. It has deep blacks and sky-high contrast, but it's a bit dim at maximum brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is where the K3 Note truly shines thanks to its hard-working Mediatek chip. It smokes the likes of Snapdragon 61 when raw processor power is called for and graphics performance is towards the top of the class too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that might have hurt endurance, as we would have loved to see better scores in the battery department. It's wonderful that the battery is replaceable, but the unimpressive screen-on times mean that you might simply have to make use of that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP primary camera is another so-so area in the K3 Note's act. It does a good job with color reproduction and exposure, but underdelivers on detail and dynamic range. Casual snaps destined to be shared online will look great, large prints less so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming up with alternatives in this equipment grade and price range didn't turn out so hard. It's a short list nonetheless. The FullHD 5.5-inchers start off with the Meizu m2 note/m1 note duo. The m1 lacks a microSD slot, so if that feature is a must to you, it drops out early in the race. It's also running KitKat while the m2 and the K3 Note both boot Lollipop. Both Meizus have sealed batteries, so the K3 Note scores points here and it's also the only one with an FM radio receiver, but it shoots inferior images. The K3 Note has the more convincing chipset as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 packs a more powerful chipset and that's about it. Similar build, feature set, battery life, and camera output mean it all comes down to personal preference and regional availability. Minor differences in user interface between MIUI and Vibe might help some decide, and Xiaomi does have a stronger following in the developer world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yu Yureka Plus is another option, but only available in India. This one is powered by a Qualcomm chip for a change - the Snapdragon 615, but otherwise has a very similar specsheet. A red flag should be the 2,500mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This ends the list of sub-$200 competitors, we told you it's a short one. For about $80 more than the K3 Note, you can have an entry-level Samsung phablet, and that would mean settling for 720p display resolution. The Galaxy J7 has a beautiful Super AMOLED display, interestingly brighter than the K3 Note's LCD, so if you're into outdoor video watching on your smartphone, it may be worth spending the extra cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only 1.5GB of RAM is on board the J7, however, and it may find multitasking more challenging than the K3 Note. With substantially longer endurance, and a swappable battery, the J7 however outbids the K3 Note's usual trump card. The J7 has a flash to complement its front cam, a bonus to a certain crowd. But again, $80 more in this case means 50% more, so the gap is pretty wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For about as much as the Galaxy J7 you could be getting an Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML, a basic one with an Atom Z3560 chip with 1.8GHz quad-core CPU, 2 gigs of RAM, and 16GB of storage. It's bulkier and heavier, its battery is non-removable, and it's not really very efficient with its use either. It is readily available across the globe though, unlike the K3 Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) could be found for about $250, but can go as high $330 elsewhere, so it very much depends on where you are in the world. It closely follows the same formula - 5.5-inch FullHD screen, midrange Snapdragon 615 SoC, expandable storage, 13MP camera. It adds a nifty reversible design with stereo speakers, and selfie enthusiasts will enjoy its 8MP front cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very important to have the proper perspective when considering the Lenovo K3 Note. At $150, a smartphone is bound to suffer from imperfections. After all, even $800 devices fail to meet certain expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the K3 Note Lenovo has tried hard to make the proper compromises, and for the most part it has succeeded. It's a capable 5.5-inch phablet with a pixel-rich display, dual-SIM connectivity, expandable storage and a removable battery - all at a bargain-basement price.</paragraph>
