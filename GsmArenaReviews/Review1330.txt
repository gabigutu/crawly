			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An 8.9" screen hits the sweet spot for tablets and LG's Optimus Pad shows good thinking. The first tablet of the company will want to make a difference among more or less uniform rivals. Tablets coming to the market look almost the same - screens, hardware, OS. There is very little room for experiment, but LG are keen to disagree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D is more of a fun show-off feature to have on the side - but LG has taken that very, very seriously. We already met with and were impressed by the Optimus 3D smartphone. Its tablet sibling didn't get an actual 3D screen, but it can take 3D stills and videos. Anaglyph 3D viewing is enabled with a standard pair of polarized glasses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad is based on the powerful NVIDIA Tegra 2 chipeset - the only one currently compatible with the Android 3 Honeycomb (though this is supposed to change with the upcoming 3.2 update). Its 8.9" TFT touchscreen of 1280 x 768 pixel resolution and 32GB of internal storage don?t sound too bad either. The imaging skills are the highpoint on the spec sheet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus Pad at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, on top of the ordinary Full HD video capture, you get 720p 3D video. At one point users of the Optimus Pad will want to consider the Optimus 3D smartphone. If they haven't already got themselves an LG 3D TV set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's arguable whether video capture - let alone 3D - is such an essential feature to have on a tablet. We wouldn't call it a unique selling point just yet - but it's obvious LG wanted to set the Optimus Pad apart from the competition. Before we get to that though, we need to get the basics out of the way. Let's take a closer look at the hardware before we proceed to Android Honeycomb and the 3D stuff.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pixel-rich screen suffers outdoors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's 1280 x 768 pixels on a 8.9? screen, for pixel density of 167ppi. That?s higher than the iPad and the Motorola XOOM - enough for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a plain TFT unit though, and viewing angles are limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors do get pretty washed out but contrast is definitely the bigger issue. Text is readable at pretty much any angle but if you?re viewing photos you will want to have the screen head on. The image quality quickly deteriorates at even the slightest tilt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make things worse, the coating of the screen is highly reflective and you end up struggling to find a proper viewing angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty though, we have been spoiled by some of the premium screens we've seen on phones lately. Tablets obviously cannot match the SuperAMOLEDs, Retinas and ClearBlacks out there. And all the issues we've identified in the LG Optimus Pad's screen are there in most other tablets too. All in all, the outdoor performance is in doubt while indoors the pixel-rich display is sharp and punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our display test table follows, to pit the LG Optimus Pad against some of the competing screens we?ve tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad looks for a design identity in the more recent batch of Optimus line smartphones. It may not be quite the classy stone-cold looker that the Motorola XOOM is, but it's not ugly by any means. In fact the LG tablet looks a bit better than the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, which is the only other 8.9" droid slate at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a Honeycomb device and the standard hardware controls (back, home and menu) move onto the screen. A Lock/Power combo is at the top and there's a volume rocker on the right. That's holding the tablet in portrait mode with the LG logo on top, though with full-circle auto-rotation there's no clear top and bottom, left and right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, there?s a 2MP front-facing camera, an ambient light sensor, a small status LED and the LG logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the tablet is the more intriguing place. There we find the dual 5 MP camera lenses, fitted with a single LED flash. The lenses are symmetrically placed either side of a brushed metal strip - an accent found on recent Optimus smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the LG Optimus Pad has a pair of stereo speakers only. On top we find the 3.5mm audio jack and a tiny charger port. There is another speaker here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This speaker layout is chosen to suit both portrait and landscape use. When held landscape, one of the two speakers at the bottom gets disabled, and the one at the top is used instead. In portrait mode, the bottom pair of speakers work only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the connectivity ports are on the left-hand side of the Optimus Pad: microUSB and HDMI ports, plus a few pins for a docking cradle. No charging off the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can slide to open a tiny bit at the top to access the SIM compartment. There is no microSD card slot on the Optimus Pad, 32GB of inbuilt storage is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matt finish on the back is quite pleasant to touch and great at hiding fingerprints. The brushed metal strip in the center nods at related Optimus smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6400mAh battery is not user accessible. It's quoted at up to 9 hours and 20 minutes of calls or 273h of standby time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad is a well-built device and styed to be consistent with the recent smartphones of the house. We found an 8.9" screen to be very welcoming on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9. That said, the problem of the Optimus Pad is weight. At more or less the same size as its Samsung rival, the LG Tablet is the unbelievable 150g heavier, which makes handling it somewhat of a harder task.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - pure Honeycomb<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad runs an unmodified version of Android 3.0.1 Honeycomb, which makes it virtually identical to some of the competing devices. The tablet version of Android is strong enough to handle almost anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video demonstration of the LG Optimus Pad user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 3 Honeycomb offers a revamped user interface to make best use of all the available resolution and the entire screen. The hardware buttons have been replaced with on-screen controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home and Back buttons are in the lower left corner, with a dedicated Task Switcher key right next to them. In part, this is perhaps a move to emphasize the multitasking nature of Honeycomb .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search key has been placed in the top left corner, while the app launcher is now accessed via a button at the top right. Next to it, there?s another dedicated button that the smartphone-friendly Android versions lack ? homescreen edit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come upon the status icons, which are in the lower right corner. Pressing any of them will open the notification pop-up. In Honeycomb the notification area doesn?t take the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a shortcut to settings. It is more of a replacement of the connectivity switches that you find in some Android smartphones (such as the Samsung TouchWiz droids), than the real settings menu, which is accessible through the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen has also been modified to make better use of the bigger screen real estate. In edit mode you get all five homescreen panes on top with four tabs available at the bottom: widgets, apps, wallpapers and ?more?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way you can grab a widget from the bottom tab and bring it to the desired homescreen pane on top. With smartphones you need to scroll screens if you want to place a widget on any other screen but the currently selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen some changes too ? it?s now split in two tabs ? All and Downloaded. The first one contains all the available apps, while the second one holds those installed by you. A press and hold on any of them will make the five homescreen panes appear so you can place a shortcut on whichever you might need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are pretty pleased with the usability of the Honeycomb interface. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design and it really is a notch above the competition in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Optimus Pad did well in terms of handling, though it did lag when we used a live wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few benchmarks to enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad comes with two optimized email applications out of the box ? one for your Gmail and one that you can use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can setup the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s basically the treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won?t notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on keypresses. There?s no haptic feedback so it?s not perfect just yet, but the overall experience is pretty decent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality but it has too been tweaked to be more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds shortcuts to the camera, image details preview or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit ? the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Optimus Pad gallery has the same issue as most of its smartphone siblings ? it doesn?t show you full size images, but downsized versions instead. This means that you cannot see all the detail on a photo on the tablet itself, which is a pity, given the excellent picture browsing potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To end the gallery overview on a positive note we?ll mention a cool accelerometer-based trick. In the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good looking music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad music player has visually appealing interface and lets you sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, playlist or just bring the new and recent additions on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) you get the familiar split screen interface. Album art, which is naturally supported, appears on the left along with the information about the playlist. The track list goes on the right and the currently playing track (if any) appears at the bottom with quick controls available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen offers shuffle and repeat (including repeat one) functionality, but no equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background, a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. There are also quick pause or skip controls right there so you don?t need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player does 1080p videos, lacks codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the large screen and enviable processing power, the LG Optimus Pad doesn?t make for much of a portable video player. And you can tell that right from the start as the thing doesn?t even have a dedicated video player app - everything is in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the player handles up to 1080p MP4 videos. You have to be careful with the bitrate though, because higher bitrate 1080p videos might end up choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is also seemingly a few years old with DivX and Xvid nowhere in sight. You will have to either get a third-party app for playing those, which will inevitably harm performance or convert all your videos before uploading them to the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully Mass Storage mode is enabled, unlike the Motorola XOOM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good web browser, poor Flash video performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. With full Flash support, the Optimus Pad gets an edge over the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser and opening a new one is as easy as clicking the plus sign on the right. The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field - typical Android - which scores another point for the Optimus Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks have their own screen and history uses a split-screen interface letting you check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords and you can pick the default zoom level for the browser. Not that altering the zoom is that hard with pinch-zoom, naturally, being supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance ? the Optimus Pad does okay with 360p videos right in the browser and 480p are watchable too (even if they do get slightly choppy at times). 720p Flash videos on the other hand are completely out of the question, though early reports suggest that the Android 3.1 update upgrades them to only mildly choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And this might have sounded good if it wasn?t for the fact that some Android smartphones are already doing 720p Flash and the Galaxy S II even manages 1080p. Obviously LG (or NVIDIA, we are not quite sure here) still has some catching up to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a pair of 3D-enabled 5 megapixel cameras and a 2 megapixel front-facing unit, the LG Optimus Pad unmatched for imaging skills among tablets. However, shooting with a tablet is hardly the most comfortable thing so we wonder how high Full HD video and 720p 3D clips will rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus Pad's camera interface is quite simple. You get flash settings, white balance, color effects and scenes on a convenient dial as well as resolution settings, picture quality, focus mode and exposure compensation in the extra settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also shortcuts for switching between the two cameras and alternating video and still camera modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is really impressive especially considering we're looking at a pre-release unit. The amount of resolved detail is excellent, the colors quite pleasant on most occasions. Contrast is a bit low though and there's the seldom case when the colors come out off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can see for yourself in our Photo Compare Tool that the LG Optimus Pad is a lot better performer than the Motorola XOOM and lots of other 5 megapixel droids.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus Pad is capable of recording videos up to 1080p. There aren?t too many settings available to the user: LED as video light, white balance, color effects, video quality and time-lapse interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The captured videos also turned out quite decent. We noticed a few dropped frames here and there but we'll refrain from judgments until we get our hands on a retail unit. We did like though what we saw there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s an untouched 1080p video sample taken straight from the Optimus Pad camera for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D camcorder and 3D video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our unit wasn't capable of taking 3D still images, and we are just not sure if this feature will be enabled in the retail units. Fortunately the 3D camcorder was intact, capable of shooting 720p 3D videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder offers very few options. You also get to choose the 3D viewing mode: anaglyph, mixed, single or side-by-side. Generally, you will have the viewfinder in anaglyph mode with 3D glasses, but it's good to see you have options here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the 3D depth (be careful with that), choose the video quality, set the white balance and turn the audio recording on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come some samples from the LG Optimus Pad camcorder. Just have in mind that this is a pre-market unit, and the videos are not bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the Optimus Pad 3D videos onto an Optimus 3D smartphone and they are fully compatible. We watched them in 3D without glasses trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's one video sample we uploaded to YouTube - don't forget to choose 720p and select the right type of 3D:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 720p 3D video sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the samples in 3D, you have to use the integrated LG 3D video player. The interface is rather simple and you have just one option - view the video in anaglyph mode or side by side. You can use a standard pair of anaglyph glasses to watch the 3D content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Pad is the first tablet of the house and - for obvious reasons - it's not much different from other Honeycomb tablets. While some manufacturers will tempt you with exclusive pre-installed content, LG are looking to make a bigger splash with their newly-found headline feature - 3D imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess, it's two things that define the Optimus Pad: one unique ability and one archrival. It all boils down to how these two will balance out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key feature is of course 3D video. Yes, it can make the difference among competitors but on the other hand shooting video with a tablet isn't much different from shooting video with the kitchen tray. Then again even shooting with a kitchen tray might catch on if you add a drop of 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, it has to be really important. And some users just don't care enough about a tablet's video capture capabilities. If that's the case - you might want to check out something a lot more manageable in terms of body weight. The super slim and lightweight Samsung Galaxy Tab is an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It certainly isn't an easy choice though. And the fact that you can put it in a wider 3D context with smartphones and TVs, makes it even harder. Plus, promoting the 3D technology is an end in itself for LG so the Optimus Pad will probably get good support, which is quite important in the long run.</paragraph>
