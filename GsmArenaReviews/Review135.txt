			<paragraph>If a phone can get away with looking like a dummy phone, it's art. Let's see. You wouldn't want to touch the LG Crystal. At least a couple of minutes you'll just sit back and admire. OK, you'll eventually start exploring it and the question will slowly emerge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What kind of keyboard do you put on a full-touch phone? Well the answer is simple - a touchpad. The LG Crystal keypad is not a real keypad, but a transparent touchpad instead. And it's not there as a typing commodity, it's there for the coolness of it. How sick is that you may ask? Well, we don't really know but we're infected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are previewing a pre-production unit here but it's the most final design that LG currently have and happily matches the latest official photos, so the exterior will most likely stay the same in the final retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've followed the Crystal as closely as we have, you will know that back in the day when it was first displayed to the public it had a strikingly different blue front panel gradient that later on silently disappeared. We guess them focus groups are more fond of uniform gray than gradient blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, even if it yells handle with care, the LG Crystal carries a bulletproof spec sheet. All-inclusive imaging, multimedia and connectivity on the inspired S-class interface: prepare to be impressed and entertained. To help you take your eyes off the phone at least for a short while, here is a quick summary of what the LG Crystal is all about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Crystal at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design is the defining feature of the LG GD900 Crystal but - quite against the general rule - it doesn't imply crippled functionality. The see-through keypad is cool enough to not only get the handset noticed but make it hard to resist. And then, the wide range of skills is just the thing for those who need a different kind of inspiration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the question as always is if performance will live up to the hype. The LG Arena turned an impressive performer and walked away with plenty of our respect and admiration. Now, that means we won't let the Crystal get away with anything but flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an early pre-release sample of the LG GD900 in our hands we've put together a brief preview to highlight the phone's most interesting features (exterior design being first on our list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's waste no more time and look into the crystal ball. Design and ergonomics coming up so we guess we need to wipe the Crystal clean of our drool for those beauty shots.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD900 Crystal 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal is a unique handset in a class of its own. The glowing transparent keypad is an eye-catcher that will most definitely get a lot of attention at your new toy. It's quite rare actually to see a handset that's so different than the rest that it turns into a genuine eye-snatcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GD900 Crystal isn't the slimmest of sliders around but its measures of 105 x 52.5 x 13.5 mm still make it compact enough to slip effortlessly in your pocket. Only the weight of 127 g may sound a bit hefty for such a device but it actually makes for a nice solid feel in your hand - a nice contrast with the otherwise plastic finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Out and out, what makes the LG GD900 Crystal design so magnetic is the see-through keypad and its white glow which looks fascinating, especially in the dark. You are probably sitting there wondering just like us how it was done. Well actually, the keypad is one big piece of glass with a metallic frame. At the back of the keypad there is the plastic battery cover that's also transparent but with a nice grey gradient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, when the keypad is out the whole weight still concentrates in the upper half, which makes the phone quite easy to drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design wise, the LG GD900 is quite reminiscent of the LG KF510 but the similarities are so small that they only serve to suggest the same roots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, the entire LG GD900 body is covered with a thin layer of transparent plastic, which kinda makes it look like covered with ice. Due to the heavy plastic finish, the back panel feels a bit cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the transparent plastic on the front there is a grey frame surrounding the display. The three touch sensitive buttons below the screen are etched below the display and are covered by some thicker transparent plastic. Those keys include a shortcut to the cube interface and the two standard call handling keys - Call and End.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top you get the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the video-call camera. There is also a proximity sensor that locks the display automatically when you pick the handset to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the GD900 Crystal front is taken by the 16M-color TFT capacitive touchscreen display measuring whole 3 inches in diagonal (480 x 800 pixels). Even if colorwise it may be a notch below the nice AMOLED screen of Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH, the LG Crystal display delivers nice image quality. Unfortunately it doesn't fare quite well under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the LG Arena, the LG Crystal has multi-touch support. You can take advantage of it while browsing websites or you go through the images in the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A touch of transparency<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multi-touch support goes for the touch sensitive keypad too, which by the way is next on our list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-sensitive keypad is made of completely transparent colorless glass. It is a pleasure to use for being smooth and very responsive. But the coolest thing about it is that it doubles the touchscreen as an input option. It doesn't only support simple multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom but you can also use multiple gesture shortcuts to access your favorite applications. We'll take a closer look at them in a sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the keypad is slid out, at first it glows stronger but in a while the lights get dim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only element on the left side of LG GD900 is the universal connectivity port. Notice how we don't say "the proprietary LG port". The reason is that the LG Crystal is the first LG handset to pack a standard microUSB port - an industry trend that LG seemed slow to pick up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Crystal hosts the camera key and the volume rocker. They work fine and have a nice tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG Crystal features the On/Off button which, much like on the LG Arena, is used to toggle the device in and out of standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the GD900 hosts the 8 megapixel camera and its companions - the self-portrait mirror and the LED flash. Those are of course only visible when the slider is open, giving them plenty of protection from scratches. Nearby is the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we managed to confirm, the Crystal can handle a 16GB microSD card, which is the largest currently available on the market. It also has an acceptable initializing time with that kind of cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is as interesting as the see through keypad. At first you might be wondering how to get to the battery but then you'll notice the small shiny latch at the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the semitransparent battery cover is the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery as well as the SIM card slot. The battery is quoted at 300 hours of standby and up to 6 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of LG GD900 Crystal is good. There are only slight creaks on the back. The slider is also nicely done - as is usual for LG, it's smooth and stable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only bad seed is the battery cover which scratches easily. And strictly subjectively speaking - all that plastic used is a bit too much for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But putting the bad behind our back, join us on the next page, where we take a tour of the latest LG S-Class Touch UI.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Class under the microscope<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've already tried the LG S-class user interface in our LG Arena review and LG Viewty Smart preview and we are pleased with the snappiness and visuals of the new thumbable UI. The LG Crystal runs the same S-class thing and is identical to what we saw on its LG siblings with one exception - the LG GD900 Crystal has a refreshing new white interface theme that its forerunners lacked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"If it's not broken, don't try to fix it": LG seem to know this well - the visuals of the interface remain familiar, but still spectacular - everything from homescreen to dropdown menus rolls, sweeps in, unfolds and revolves extra smoothly with a responsiveness that implies some heavy graphics acceleration. But you should already know that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video walkthrough of what the LG GD900 Crystal is all about. Make sure to turn the HD mode on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those of you who missed our previous articles about the Arena and the Viewty Smart we'll throw in a quick overview of the S-Class UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four homescreens and they break down the homescreen UI to four easily manageable chunks: widgets, contacts, shortcuts and multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter which homescreen you choose the UI never skimps on eye candy - smooth animations, reflections, 3D spatial effects, motion blurring - it's all there for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not very practical, but surely eye catching, interface feature is the Cube. The Cube is an interactive 3D element that has the four aforementioned homescreens at its sides. Selecting a side, zooms it in nice and smooth until it fills the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To start the Cube interface, you only need to press the dedicated central key - just like the LG Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the hardware keyboard to scroll through the different homescreens, just as you can do on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Crystal main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. It has the already familiar layout of four rows of menu items, which are scrollable horizontally. That way almost all menu items are simultaneously accessible without jumping from tab to tab. This time the menu theme is white, with circular thumbnails reminding of bubbles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, for those who prefer the Arena/Viewty Smart menu theme, there is an option to change it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, if you turn the phone sideways, the menu items are all visualized with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Crystal has a multitasking menu (a basic task manager). The active apps are displayed by their respective icons bouncing up and down in smooth animation. To start the multitasking menu, you need to keep the Cube launcher key pressed for a bit longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG decided to extend the basic functionality of the task manager with the "Gesture shortcuts". When you choose this option you'll have near 20 predefined shortcut-moves, which you can assign to different applications in the multitasking menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our pre-production unit we found that the particular gestures are recognized only when they are made on the glass keyboard. On the screen they just don't work. We're not really sure whether that should be the default behavior. Anyway having touch gestures is a very useful option for starting the applications you use the most. Not to mention, it looks extra cool (in a geeky way) to start applications with gestures instead of the old-fashioned way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to see how gesture control works, check out our hands-on video embedded on this page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Inputting text climbs up the next level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the LG GD900 Crystal offers an onscreen alphanumeric keypad in portrait orientation and a landscape QWERTY thumboard. The QWERTY keys are smallish but each symbol you tap is clearly marked by iPhone-style pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told we got used to typing on the QWERTY keyboard quite fast despite repeated criticism by many users. More than often it's even more accurate than the iPhone when used on a daily basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving your cursor through the text is also a breeze. You can either tap on place of the screen where you want your cursor or, if you need more precision, a longer press over the cursor activates a virtual loupe that allows you to move it around more accurately character by character (think iPhone style). Copying and pasting is always available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But hey, don't forget the nice and illuminated glass-made keypad. When you slide it while typing, the onscreen keyboard disappears and you're welcome to use the hardware one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time is quite unusual because it's like typing with the virtual numeric keypad, but it's not virtual at all. And of course, the blue lights surrounding the whole thing are a feast both for your eyes and the crowd around you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The gallery is all you will ever need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Crystal offers two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid while in landscape mode one image is displayed in the center and two more by its side in an impressive 3D spatial view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Crystal also supports multi-touch, so you can zoom in on images with the pinching gesture well known from Apple's handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the hardware keypad is as easy as using the screen and the advantage here is that your fingers don't get in your way while scrolling/zooming. Multi-touch is also available and frankly we very much liked the whole idea of using an external sensor glass for exploring the gallery. You get the full touch experience, but you don't obstruct the view with your finger. When you add the transparent factor, the whole thing gets so sci-fi (geeks silently rejoice).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dolby enhanced music playback rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal music player is accessible from both the Cube interface and the main menu. The homescreen music player is rather basic but it does the job of quick access to your music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tracks are placed on a rotating reel and get displayed with their album artwork "printed" on virtual vinyl records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full-featured music player sits in the main menu. You can sort tracks by artist, album, genre and your rating. The current track's artwork, name, album and artist are displayed in the screen's center while the next and previous track are visible at the top and bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of equalizer presets (all non-customizable, though). Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement is among them. With Dolby Mobile selected the sound gets more spacious and richer - but the effect is best perceived on headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player calls for a serious upgrade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal comes with a relatively large touch screen (especially for a device of that size) measuring a good 3". That, along with the DivX/XviD video support turns it into a potentially excellent portable video player - especially considering the good track record. The LG Renoir, for instance, managed to play every desktop XViD/DivX video we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, that's not the case with LG Arena or LG Viewty Smart or even the LG Crystal as it turned out. The only DivX videos we managed to play where those converted through the DivX converter on the supplied CD and they have a maximum resolution of 320 x 240 pixels (QVGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the LG Renoir, with the LG Crystal the Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement can be turned on during video playback as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser has been optimized a bit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Arena and Viewty Smart browser needed some finishing, namely regarding the lag while moving down the page or zooming in/out on it. Luckily LG made some changes and even though the lag is still noticed, the web browser is much faster loading pages and smoother scrolling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor keyboard is another huge advantage. Except for zooming you can use it as a trackpad. Sweeping a finger across it moves the mouse on the screen. This eliminates the continuous tapping on some hyperlink or a button, until the browser understands that you want to select it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, and quite expectedly, there is no Flash support or Wi-Fi streaming. C'mon LG it can't be that hard! At least it can't be as hard as making a transparent touch-sensitive keypad if you get our drift.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixels can do the trick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal is in the 8 megapixel team, which is still considered quite hot in the cameraphone league. The maximum resolution isn't the decisive factor when it comes to image quality but it surely adds to the amount of resolved detail, bears tighter post-production cropping and of course, at least theoretically, allows bigger prints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the 8 megapixel Viewty Smart, the LG Crystal takes photos at a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels and video recording goes as high as 720 x 480 pixels at 30 frames per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unit we used for this preview is hardly a final version so we don't really set our requirements high for this article. In-camera image processing is bound to get a lot of further fine tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some downsampled shots to give you a general impression. We won't be pusblishing full-res ones as some of you tend to be quite harsh on those even though it's only a pre-production unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Crystal viewfinder is identical to the one on the LG Viewty Smart, except for the lack of the high pitched Intelligent shot mode. You access all camera settings via the four buttons on the left of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the screen is another bar with a virtual shutter key, exit and gallery buttons. It's actually not part of the viewfinder - that's the way to get around the wider aspect ratio of the LG Arena screen compared to the sensor's aspect ratio. The benefit of this is that the GD900 Crystal doesn't crop bits of the scene like the LG Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice improvement over the interface in the Arena, introduced in the Viewty Smart, is that the virtual on-screen shutter key can be used to switch between still and video camera - just by sliding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second new thing is the manual focus that wasn't an option on the LG Arena. Much like on the LG Viewty Smart, it's operated by dragging a virtual slider on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced settings menu is a clever rotating dial with the available options for each setting displayed as a list. The interface is very handy, neat and usable, and geotagging and image stabilization are among the nice extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 Crystal is capable of capturing video of up to D1 (720x480) resolution at 30 fps, as well as VGA@30fps. Overall video recording quality is acceptable, the colors are reasonably accurate and the video is relatively smooth with just a few duplicated frames. Still image recording has a long way to go in order to reach the LG Arena quality wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video clips are recorded in 3gp format with the usual mp4 codec for VGA clips, while recording D1 videos use the H.264 codec instead. Because of the different aspect ratios, D1 video in the viewfinder is padded with black bars on the top and bottom, while VGA has bars on the sides, but they are small and unobtrusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video can be captured in slow-motion mode, at 120 frames per second, or conversely - the 'Fast' mode does time-lapse video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These options are quite fun but, unfortunately, the output videos are still limited to QVGA resolution. The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH for example already shoots fast motion VGA videos of enviable quality. We can understand why slow-motion videos are limited to QVGA but fast-motion videos don't require more processing power than there is, in fact, they should use less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash can be turned on to act as a video light. Quite naturally, you can also record sound with videos, except in the fast/slow-mo modes of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There you have it folks - the LG GD900 Crystal surely is a handset that cannot go unnoticed. The see-through keypad is a true novelty and deserves much credit. The fact that its practicality is barely up to scratch is hardly worth mentioning as long as looks are so impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kudos to LG R&amp;D for thinking out of the box and stylishly denying our claim that there isn't much room for creativity in full-touch devices. We are also pretty glad that they chose such a well equipped phone for a base. The LG Crystal is a really attractive product with excellent value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no GPS on board, but the scarce GPS navio software options and the variable success rate we had with those on the LG Arena and Viewty Smart makes us think that it's not a great loss. After all, Wi-Fi is there and for mission-critical applications, you can always get an external Bluetooth GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So from where we stand, the GD900 Crystal is a great step forward and now all it needs to succeed is to keep up the initial pace. A nice camera and a better job of those nice gesture shortcuts are topping our wish list, while the S-Class UI is just fine the way it is.</paragraph>
