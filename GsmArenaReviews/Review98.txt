			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The folks at Asos certainly had a streak of sleepless nights preparing for this year's IFA and brought a huge number of devices - some entirely new, others already announced, but not all of them released yet. There's the brand new Zenwatch 3 smartwatch, the Transformer 3 convertibles, a Zenbook 3 notebook, the Zenpad 3S 10 tablet, and the Zenscreen portable monitor - a whole new breed of a device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's before we even start with the Zenfones. Announced all the way back at the end of May, the Zenfone 3 family (quite a big one, too) has only recently started to make it to store shelves in Asia. To see them now on European soil makes us think that wider availability will follow soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did get to spend some precious moments with a few of these devices, and you can find the quick links below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenwatch 3 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenwatch 3 was the centerpiece of the Asus IFA presentation, at least as far as we're concerned. With the new smartwatch, the Taiwanese have abandoned the rectangular designs of the previous two generations and gone with a more traditional-looking circular shape, though leaving it at that would be unfair to the designers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we elaborate on that, let's do a quick roundup of the Zenwatch 3's key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenwatch 3's case is made of grade 316L stainless steel, the same material is used in stainless steel jewelry and traditional analog watches. That lends the Zenwatch 3 an exquisite feel and one that elevates it above its pay grade. In terms of weight, it's still lighter that you would expect from a similarly sized conventional watch, but it's close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenwatch 3 can be had in one of three case colors - gunmetal, silver and rose gold. We only got to see the first two of those, the rose gold option was nowhere to be found. There's a piece of it in all three paintjobs, though - the ring around the display (or watch face, if you prefer) is finished in rose gold, regardless of the main body color. That may be the one objectionable aspect of the Zenwatch 3's design, or it could be the best thing about it, depending on who you ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if the usual chronograph comes with a crown and a couple of buttons, the usual Android Wear smartwatch typically has just a single button. Not so on the Zenwatch 3, where you get the former configuration as another throwback to simpler, mechanical times. They should bring added functionality, and while in our brief experience they do indeed (top one is used for shortcuts), it's certainly not indispensable from a usability standpoint. They do look good, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lugs are quite unique themselves too. They are angled downwards to naturally wrap around your wrist, but that fluidity is deliberately broken by a notch on either side so they don't appear massive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have leather or rubber as strap options - there is no stainless steel bracelet variant for the time being. The leather strap we tried on was nicely soft and comfortable, and certainly didn't feel like it would need months of wear to mold around your wrist. The rubber one was good too, though we've seen even better from other manufacturers. No fancy buckles here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is a 1.4-inch (or 1.39" if Asus insists) AMOLED of 400 x 400 pixels resolution and, for all we know it could be the same one as on the Huawei Watch, or at least very similar. It's distinctly larger than the one on the old Gear S2 (1.2"). The 2nd-gen Moto 360 42mm is marginally smaller at 1.37", but there are no unsightly flat tires on the Zenwatch, obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four dozen pre-installed watch faces, so you won't be left without options, plus you can always download more. The display looks nice and sharp, though the venue floor is never a good place to judge its merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did get to handle the Zenfone 3 range too. On the next couple of pages, we share our early impressions with a number of Zenfone 3 models: vanilla, Deluxe, Ultra, Laser, and Max.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 3 ZE552KL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Three full months since the Zenfone 3 lineup was announced, the smartphones are only gradually making their way to users' hands. And not all of them, mind you, it's Asian markets getting the vanilla Zenfone 3 first, with the rest of the world and and the rest of the models to follow. This right now is the first time we ourselves are getting a close look at the handsets too, starting with the Zenfone 3 ZE552KL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And not a great first impression, it must be said, as the Zenfone 3 is a fingerprint nightmare. The back takes on grease with ease, and is a pain to keep clean. When you do wipe the smudges away though, the concentric circles effect resembling that of the Zenbooks looks truly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smudges aside, the Zenfone e ZE552KL has its controls logically laid out with the power button within easy reach on the right, the volume rocker above it. The 3.5mm jack is on top, while the Type-C port (only USB 2.0 spec though) is on the bottom, as is the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe ZS570KL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You're a lot more likely to fancy the Deluxe version, for a number of reasons. The slightly larger display doesn't make that big of a difference, but the hardware is vastly superior and so is the finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal unibody is nowhere nearly as friendly to fingerprints (keeps them away, actually) and looks as great as it feels in the hand. The phone doesn't feel as heavy as you'd think and the surfaces are nice and grippy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The circular pattern is still present here, only this time just on the front around the display. And the AMOLED display itself is beautiful too. We only wish the bezels would have been smaller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls follow the same principle as the previous model with the power button and volume rocker on the same side. The top houses the 3.5mm jack, and the Type-C connector on the bottom does adhere to USB 3.0 standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't miss the rest of the Zenfone 3 models on the next page, including the giant phablet-pushing-on-tablet 6.8-inch Ultra.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ZU680KL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the phablet came into life, a lot of eyebrows were raised and yet, a few years later, we have devices verging on 7 inches, that still want to pass as a phone. Well, the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra is just a fraction of an inch short of that, and it is big, there's no denying that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all its sheer size though, its weight is perfectly manageable, a feeling reinforced by its thinness, a mere 6.8mm. Handling benefits from the grippy surfaces and the back doesn't hold too many fingerprints either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ultra sports an entirely different control layout, one simply warranted by its dimensions. There is a proper physical Home button, which holds a fingerprint sensor. The volume rocker is on the back, where it was on the previous-gen Zenfones, and where the bulk of this year's models have their fingerprint readers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is so big that even the FullHD resolution is far from ideal at that diagonal. It's still reasonably sharp, though we wouldn't stretch 1080p any further. We're no fans of the black frame that surrounds it either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 3 Laser ZC551KL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving down the ranks, we find the Zenfone 3 Laser ZC551KL. Positioned below the vanilla Zenfone 3, this midranger does get a FullHD display nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only that, but it's arguably better looking than the base model, as its satin finished back wards off fingerprints a lot more successfully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The control layout is identical to the Zenfone 3 - power button and volume rocker on the right side. This model doesn't get a Type-C connector at all, it's the good old microUSB 2.0 at the bottom (you cant see it, but trust us).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL is the budget model of the lineup, with its priorities set towards longevity. That said, last year's Max had a 5,000mAh battery vs. 4,130mAh for the new model, but there's a lot more to battery life that just cell capacity, so we won't judge just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.2-inch display has 720p resolution, so pixel density is below 300ppi, but still acceptable at 282ppi. The black frame surrounding it is more objectionable though, you may want to stick to dark backgrounds to mask it. You won't be surprised by control placement, just don't look for the laser autofocus window - there isn't one.</paragraph>
