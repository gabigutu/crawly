			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's that time again - the summer edition of our tablet buyer's guide is up so you can go slate-shopping the right way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the last issue back in February, a lot of new devices have hit the market and we've done our best to include the right ones complete with their price tags and relevant alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, the list of suggested tablets is broken down in three tiers: compact, mid and full-size. The devices in each category are sorted by price, low to high. There are cheap gadgets that are a worth a look (in our humble opinion) and it's entirely up to you whether you'll make a move for the premium offerings or some reasonably-priced options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of compact tablets welcomes back some golden oldies like the Nexus 7 (2013) which has had another price cut, while others have failed to stay competitive and therefore had to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-sized tablet market remains the busiest and it's here that we saw the most meaningful price reductions. Some notable newcomers such as the Nokia N1 and the Dell Venue 8 7000 are rubbing shoulders with the likes of the Lenovo Tab S8, Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact and Nvidia Shield, which have gotten cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the full-sized tablet market, things have remained mostly unchanged save for a few tablets that have had a slight discount.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the end of our guide we look at what didn't make the cut. We have some very big names there that you'd think are a cinch to recommend but it isn't actually that simple. Stay tuned for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we don't feature Windows tablets as we have very few of them in our database and we generally feel they are outside our focus. They're practically PCs and not the web and multimedia oriented tablets we deal with here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Compact tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The compact tablets are leading the way as usual and the cheapest of them all is the Lenovo Tab 2 A7-10. A close relative to the A7-10 A3500 from our last edition, this one comes with a 7? IPS LCD of 600 x 1024px and 170ppi, a quad-core Cortex-A7 Mediatek processor, 8GB of internal storage and reasonable size and weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a no-frills device but its price tag says it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next entry is the Alcatel Pixi 3 (7), which costs a bit more but does well to add 3G connectivity. In fact, the Wi-Fi only Pixi 3 (7) costs the same as the 3G variant and you may find the latter subsidized by your carrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs are nothing to rave about but they fill the bill just fine. The Alcatel Pixi 3 (7) has a 7? 600 x 1024px display and a quad-core CPU. The 512MB of RAM and the poor 4GB of inbuilt storage are potentially troubling. Not all Android builds allow you to move most apps onto a microSD card, so the low onboard space may become a problem in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving up to just below 100 Euro (and just above $100), we come to the seasoned Lenovo A7-50 A3500. It?s a step up in screen resolution too, at 800 x 1280px across the same 7? diagonal. The processor is the entry-level quad-core Cortex-A7 and there?s 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, you?re getting a more pixel-dense screen resolution for a bit more cash over the aforementioned entry-level tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 7 comes with a much better 7? IPS display of 800 x 1280px resolution, a 5MP 1080p-enabled camera and a competent Intel Atom Z3745 chipset that?s more than capable of handling Android KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have been nice if the tablet shipped with Android Lollipop or if Asus was faster at supplying it. Still this is a great offer for the money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus FonePad 7 is almost the same product as the Memo Pad 7 but for a few key differences. It packs the same 7? IPS display of the same 800 x 1280px resolution, a 5MP camera and a similar body but comes with a dual-core Intel Atom Z2560 instead of the quad-core Z3745 of the Memo Pad 7 and offers built-in 3G and LTE along with voice call support thanks to a micro-SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This iteration of the Fonepad by Asus is a bit old now and might only get as high as Android KitKat but it is still better equipped than its newer siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The already affordable 7" Amazon Kindle Fire HDX hasn?t received any further discounts but its price tag is more than reasonable for the level of equipment. It's worth noting that Amazon is expected to refresh its line of 7-inch Kindle Fire HDXs in two months time so it may be worth it to wait. The Kindle Fire HDX moves toward higher-specced tablets with a 1200 x 1920px display, a Snapdragon 800 chipset, 2GB of RAM, LTE connectivity and storage options ranging from 16GB to 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bit about storage options is important as the Kindle Fire HDX has no card slot and you'll need to keep that in mind. Another thing to remember is the forked Android version on board - it isn't compatible with Google Play Services and won't bring you the same Android experience as most of the tablets in this guide. The Kindle Fire HDX is basically a means to tap into Amazon's content and that's the reason Amazon can afford to sell its hardware at a lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That means you?ll be enjoying every Amazon service and product but won?t be able to take advantage of all the things you like about Google?s Android operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tablet you?ll be well familiar with. During our last tablet buyer?s guide the Asus-made Nexus 7 (2013) was quite a bit more expensive and we excluded it from the rankings. Its price has now settled and it proudly takes the best spot in our compact tablets lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 (2013) is two years old now and we hope Google is working on its replacement but it?s still well worth it. It provides a great 7? IPS display of 1200 x 1920px, great stereo speakers, the very latest in Google Android thanks to the Nexus moniker and an LTE variant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because this is a Nexus device its storage is non-expandable but thanks to it being a Nexus there?s very little bloatware to bog it down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Mid-sized tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?re now entering the most crowded and most cut-throat of all the tablet tiers ? the mid-sized one. This is where most manufacturers give their best and where most manufacturers push the best hardware and the most innovation. For the most part this ties is also where you?ll find the best bang for your buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting from the lowest prices we have the Lenovo A8-50 A5500 which has an 8" 800 x 1280px display, quad-core Cortex-A7 processor, 5MP camera and optional 3G model with stereo speakers. It's the cheapest 8-incher around for the second time running and while it doesn't shine with immaculate specs or design it will do couch duty with ease and won't affect your financial stability too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition it has either 8GB or 16GB of on-board storage with the higher 16GB model not adding much to the price and you get a microSD card slot to expand that storage even more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What comes as a possible catch is the firmware update support the Lenovo A8-50 will get - we don't reckon it will see Lollipop any time soon, if at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor T1 is next on the list. Unlike its MediaPad X1 sibling it isn't as spectacular on the specs sheet but just like it, the Honor Tablet comes with 3G connectivity and the ability to make and receive calls as standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the cellular abilities the Huawei Honor T1 has an 8" IPS 800 x 1280px display, 5MP camera, 16GB of storage, expandable through a microSD card slot and a front-facing camera for calls. The only weak spot here is the Snapdragon 200 chipset that doesn't really match the more powerful offerings on the other devices in the group, even if it will get the job done for most tasks. Heavy gamers and general power users will need to spend more as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next is the Asus Memo Pad 8 ME181C. It's very similar to the 7" Memo Pad 7 we mentioned in the previous page but has a bigger 8" IPS display on tap and it comes with the same 800 x 1280 resolution. The chipset is the same - an Intel Atom Z3745 - although its processor is clocked lower at 1.33GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Memo Pad 8 ME181C lacks a cellular option though but the Wi-Fi model is well worth a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Fonepad 8 FE380CG is very close to the Memo Pad 8 but comes with an Intel Atom Z3530 chip and a built-in SIM card slot with 3G abilities and calling. That extra ability costs considerably more, though, compared to the Memo Pad 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next option is very impressive. For $200 you can get the best Android-powered iPad mini-killers out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenpad S 8.0 packs an 8? IPS LCD of Retina iPad-equal 1536 x 2048px resolution, a powerful Intel Atom (either the Z3530 or the Z3580) with a quad-core processor and either 2GB or 4GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenpad S 8.0 runs on Android Lollipop out of the box and comes in a sleek and stylish package. The 2GB model will run you $199 while the 4GB one $299. Unfortunately, this means the tablets is very hard to come by outside of the US. It also doesn?t offer LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more globally available option is the stylish Lenovo Tab S8. It's very light at a hair below 300g and also thin at 7.9mm. The Lenovo Tab S8 uses a great Intel Atom Z3745 chipset with a higher-clocked CPU (1.86GHz), 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage that can be expanded via a microSD card and an 8MP camera on the back, complimented by a 1.6MP front-facing one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tab S8 is not the cheapest one here at ?189 but has a sleek design and also an LTE option (although that one costs even more - ?220).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Tab S8 is among the better mid-sized slates in this guide and we'd wholeheartedly recommend it to buyers. Keep in mind that it's not as widespread as the some other slates on this list and its price hasn't changed much for the better in the last three months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last time we passed on enrolling the Nokia N1 tablet in the list because it was a China-only tablet. Nowadays it?s still not easy to acquire but it is more broadly available, including in Europe and the US via retailers like Amazon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N1 tablet sees a big increase in pricing for this mid-sized list but brings some redeeming qualities to justify it. For starters the Nokia N1 runs an almost completely stock version of Android Lollipop with Nokia?s gesture-based Z Launcher on top. Secondly, the Nokia N1 has a sleek aluminum and glass body and a clear iPad mini-inspired design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the N1 is full of important tech like the 7.9? 1536 x 2048px display, an Intel Atom Z3580 with four cores, memory expansion through the microSD slot and stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In its first-gen stage the Nokia N1 lacks GPS, LTE and an FM Radio. And its price outside China is higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last time we discarded the Nvidia Shield because of rumors of an upgrade but that didn?t come to fruition. This time we?ll include the slate but since it was announced exactly a year ago we caution that it may very well be replaced soon. Also its price hasn?t moved since it was launched and currently sits a bit higher than we would like it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all of that out of the way the Nvidia Shield tablet is great. It offers a near-Nexus experience with stock Android Lollipop, an 8? 1200 x 1920px display, front-facing stereo speakers, Nvidia?s own Tegra K1 chipset, which is plenty powerful and allows for Nvidia?s GRID game streaming service with lots of optimized game titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could also get a controller for the Nvidia Shield tablet and game to your heart?s content. And if you have Nvidia graphics on your PC there are ways to stream your games onto the Shield tablet too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't make a reputable tablet shopping guide without mentioning the Apple iPad in some form. In this particular case we're going with the Apple iPad mini 2. It's not the latest mid-sized slab to come out of Cupertino but it is the best one to buy. The iPad mini 2 has come down in price slightly and is now ?100 cheaper at retailers than its successor iPad mini 3. Our opinion of the latter is known - it brings a finger-sensing TouchID home button and golden paintjob for ?100 more which doesn't make sense to recommend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take notice that Apple is likely to release the iPad mini 4 this fall (October/November) so it could be wise to wait for the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3 to be discounted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 has the same, beautiful 7.9" 1536 x 2048px display (Apple calls it Retina) as its successor, the same excellent 64-bit A7 chipset with great CPU and GPU performance, the same streamlined body of 331g weight and 7.5mm thickness, same great battery life and the same superb Apple iOS 8 with loads of tablet-optimized apps that are purely gorgeous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 isn't the best tablet for the power user who demands great connectivity and use with other gadgets but has a character of its own which has helped Apple carve its tablet market dominance from day one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the UI of iOS cannot be customized, storage is fixed and can only be upgraded for a hefty price increase but if you don't care about leaving Apple's ecosystem, the iPad mini 2 is great and it comes with an LTE option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has a great mid-sized tablet in the face of the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact. It's packed with "the best from Sony" with an 8" 1200 x 1920px display, 6.4mm featherweight body (270g), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 8.1MP camera, microSD card slot and Sony?s well-known excellent battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add more to what is already a superb package the Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is waterproof so you can take it into the tub (or pool) without worrying over it. Dust is sealed out too. And the front-firing stereo speakers are great to have as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the Wi-Fi version has gone down significantly but the LTE variant is much more expensive than it was at the time of our last tablet buyer?s guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's high time to look at Google's finest in the HTC Nexus 9. This is the true powerhouse with a 64-bit Tegra K1 chipset, 8.9" 1536 x 2048px IPS display, front-facing stereo speakers and the best of Android on a tablet with Lollipop on board and the promise of timely updates for the foreseeable future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google is expected to unveil the latest Nexus slate this fall (November is most likely) so you could wait a bit and see what lies ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 9 has everything covered from high-end gaming to connectivity with an LTE Cat4-ready platform. We loved the speakers on the front and also the display and found Android Lollipop a step up from KitKat for tablet functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC-made Nexus 9 is the best tablet you can buy if you want Android as your operating system. It?s arguably the best tablet you can buy, period. The Wi-Fi Nexus 9 is now slightly cheaper compared to five months ago but the LTE model has retained its high asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, a tablet that?s equal to the HTC Nexus 9 in price but has a different approach to great tableting. It packs an 8.4? 1600 x 2560px display of 359ppi and is, most impressively, OLED. Underneath the sleek 6.1mm exterior Dell has packed an Intel Atom Z3580 chip, a microSD card slot, an 8MP camera and optional LTE. There are also stereo speakers on the front and two 720p depth-sensing cameras on the back courtesy of Intel RealSense tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Dell Venue 8 7000 is only available for purchase in the US currently for $400.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-sized tablets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally after crossing the 9-inch threshold we arrive at the biggest tier, literally ? the full-sized tablets. This is where you?ll find the tablets that aim at trashing the laptop?s party.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one here is the Huawei MediaPad T1 10, which is the cheapest full-sized tablet with 3G abilities. It also offers an LTE model that isn?t as cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad T1 10 has a 9.6? display that stretches its 800 x 1280px resolution rather thin at 157ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the price you get an adequate Snapdragon 410 chipset, 5MP camera and fairly light-weight device of 433g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is next up and it is the cheapest FullHD 10" tablet to be found for the second time running. It manages this by using a lowly Snapdragon 400 chipset which isn't up to par with most of the competition in this guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ has a good display and an innovative design with a 3-stage kickstand that allows the slate to stand on a desk. There are also two speakers under the display that project frontal stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the price for the Wi-Fi only version of the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ has gone down slightly. There's also a 3G unit available but that has gone up in price, so those looking to stay connected outdoors better look elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand we have the Lenovo Yoga 2 10.1, which looks similar to the aforementioned HD+. It too has a 3-stage kickstand and front-facing stereo speakers but offers a much faster Intel Atom chipset for a bit more cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's excellent Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 deserves a mention too. It has a very high-resolution display and all the bells and whistles of a high-end full-sized slate - stereo speakers, great chipset, expandable storage, 8MP camera, great battery life and is attractively priced at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's in line to receive Android Lollipop but even as it is, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has a very capable software package geared toward great productivity with Samsung's Multi Window, which is even more useful on such a big display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z4 tablet has just come out and while we loved it, it?s way too pricey at the moment so we recommend you take a look at the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, which is still great. It?s slim and light, water and dust proof and has a good 10.1? 1920 x 1200px display and a fast Snapdragon 800 chipset with 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet boasts stereo speakers on the front as well as a reduced price tag due to its successor hitting the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the name to beat. The Apple iPad Air is a year old but shows just how good Apple is at making tablets - the screen (which uses specs that are 3 years old) is great, the body is among the slimmest at this size and there's a quality A7 chipset running the show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expect Apple to release the iPad Air 3 this October/November which is a consideration as the older Air and Air 2 are likely to get a price cut or, in the case of the former, even be cut from the frontline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air is streamlined with a great aluminum body that's just 7.5mm thick. Apple has managed to accommodate stereo speakers and a 128GB option into the tight spot. Then there's Apple's iOS 8 which runs as smooth as you'd like and also offers a superb app catalogue that's tailored specifically for the iPad Air's display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with everything made by Apple, the iPad Air suffers from low customizability as well as no option to increase the built-in storage, aside from paying a premium for the next bigger variant. The iPad Air has gotten cheaper since last we saw it, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally for those users that really don?t want a laptop we have the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2. It packs a huge 12.2? display of very high 2560 x 1600px resolution, two great chipsets to choose from (whether you?ve got the Wi-Fi or LTE model), an 8MP camera, stereo speakers and Samsung?s TouchWiz UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latter makes the most sense for multitasking on a tablet (until iOS 9 and the Apple iPad Air 2 prove a challenge) with four apps running on the same screen (not counting Windows tablets of course). And while not cheap by any means, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 has gotten cheaper over the last five months.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What didn't make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We feel listing some of the tablets that didn't make it on the previous pages is just as important as the stuff we did covered. Not so much as a way for us to rationalize our choice of not including this or that device but to see just how the market has changed in the months since our last guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main absence in the last edition was the Google Nexus 7 (2013) which was simply too expensive to consider. This time it was the top choice in the compact category. However, we had to say no to a seasoned participant in these buying guides, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. Time and again we've chosen it over the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and many of its competitors but this time it was simply outclassed by much cheaper competition like the Lenovo Tab S8 and the Asus Zenpad S 8.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is still a great buy but there are close competitors for much less or better options for a bit more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 ? Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 3G/LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next on the list of dropouts is the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's great at what it does - an all access pass to Amazon in its content. But as its price hasn't moved an inch while the competition has, we can't recommend it in our list of mid-sized tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It costs as much if not more than a Google Nexus 9, a Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact and an Apple iPad mini 3 (and is much more expensive than the iPad mini 2). If Amazon is what you live for then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is good though not as reasonable buy as it used to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we were you, we would wait another couple of months as Amazon will probably refresh the whole lineup this September.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ah, the Apple iPad mini 3 - we really have an issue with this...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If only Apple had given the iPad mini 3 the A8X chipset of the iPad Air 2 (like it did with the iPad mini 2 and iPad Air) we would've included the iPad mini 3 in a prime spot in the mid-sized tablet's table. All Apple did was paint the iPad mini 3 gold, give it a TouchID home button, added a digit to its name and ?100 to its price. That doesn't quite qualify as a reasonable buy but wait until this fall when Apple usually refreshes the lineup and you might get a nicer deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 and Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 are still very new and as such carry an unreasonable price tag for the specs they offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 ? Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air 2 could easily be considered the best tablet on the market. Its chipset is rivaled by none, even Nvidia's Kepler GPU inside the Nexus 9 couldn't match its graphics prowess and no tablet out there can match its app catalog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just that the iPad Air still feels as great to use while it costs a good ?100 less. We were this close to letting that slide but at the end of the day the choice is all yours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet - one of the best-looking tablets available and certainly, the absolute best waterproof tablet out there. We recently reviewed Sony's slate and were very happy with it. But as it's just starting its tenure, it still carries a huge price tag we can't justify.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we sure hope to see the Xperia Z4 Tablet in our buyer's guide soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet WiFi ? Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet LTE</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the risk of upsetting many of our readers by leaving their favorites out, it is always up to you guys to decide where your money is best spent. Hope we helped by digging through hundreds upon hundreds of gadgets, prices and specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summer is the waiting season of tech. There are hardly any big announcements, we've already seen everything that came early on and we are preparing for the fall releases. But that doesn't mean there are no great tablets to be had. If anything, the newer models' prices have mostly settled and some older ones are ripe for the taking. This fall we should see Apple, Google and Amazon refresh their tablet lineups so if you are in for one of these, it's best perhaps to wait a few months and get the newer models at the same price or the current models at reduced prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be great new hardware in the months ahead and the buyer guides will keep on coming. Who knows, maybe you'll be reading the next issue on a brand new tablet. Would be nice if it's one you spotted around here. Ultimately though, we hope it's one you enjoy.</paragraph>
