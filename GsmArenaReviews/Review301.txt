			<paragraph>The Nokia N82 seems like the next flagship of the Nokia N-series of multimedia-oriented smartphones. Although it looks pretty much the same as Nokia N95 specs-wise, it outmatches the current heavyweight champion with a xenon flash and automatic screen rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While automatic screen rotation for the Nokia N95 seems to be just around the corner, there's nothing that can beat the xenon flash on those night party shoots. The Nokia N95 however has recently received some 8 gigs worth of stash for your multimedia needs plus a gorgeous 2.8-inch display. So it is a fight that's somewhat uneven, the two cannot be compared directly. Maybe the form factor will be decisive and user preference will take it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, the Nokia N82 is a highly sought after device, and we are more than happy to have finally laid our greasy hands on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are working on a fully-fledged review that should be ready some time next week. We wanted to share with you our first Nokia N82 images plus several other goodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, we present you the Nokia N82 photos. We gotta admit the N82 is not the prettiest of handsets but it looks alright - especially having in mind it's loaded with features. You can't see silvery Nokia phones often, but the Nokia N82 is one of them. Some of us would have preferred black and hope there's a black version coming in the future (you didn't hear us say 8GB, did you?).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A lot has been said about the Nokia N82 keypad and the way it resembles a Sony Ericsson rip-off. We won't comment on that as the world's leading manufacturer should know better than copying a competitor's solution. Our guess is that the N82 keypad is a revamped version of the Nokia N91 one. The Nokia N91 had an awful keypad, but with the N82 it's nothing like that. The keypad is far away from being flawless, but it takes little time to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N82 comes with a 2 GB microSD memory card included. The side keys are comfortable and the stereo speakers are both located on the right side as with N95 - obviously you are meant to watch videos and listen to music in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera on the back has a mechanical lens cover that turns the camera on automatically. The Nokia N82 is the first Nokia handset to feature a xenon flash. The N82 xenon flash is the first worthy adversary of the Sony Ericsson K850 xenon flash that has been dominating ever since its first introduction in Sony Ericsson K800. The N82 looses some points to K850 as it doesn't have a LED light for video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera quality the Nokia N82 and Nokia N95 8GB are really on par. They exercise a slightly different image processing but for the time being we cannot point out a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted an improvised xenon flash test by shooting with Nokia N82 and Sony Ericsson K850 in almost total darkness. It seems that the currently reigning xenon champion has found a match in the face of Nokia N82.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An intriguing feature of the Nokia N82 is the auto rotation of the user interface. It's not lighting fast but it's OK. The general speed of the user interface is identical to the one of Nokia N95 8GB, which is fast enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's about it. Our first impressions of Nokia N82 might be misleading to an extent, so please wait for the full-featured review we are preparing before making any hasty conclusions.</paragraph>
