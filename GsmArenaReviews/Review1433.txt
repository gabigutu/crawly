			<paragraph>It's HTC's turn to announce their new phones. As expected, HTC announced the Desire's successor, the HTC Desire HD, and the QWERTY-packing HTC Desire Z. The new droids will expand HTC's portfolio in the high-end and are sure to become a common theme in geek dreams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There have been plenty of leaks and we feel like we already know these phones. The HTC Desire HD is the GSM version of the HTC Evo 4G - 4.3" inches of touchscreen, 8MP of camera with 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z already launched as the T-Mobile G2 - bringing Android back to its QWERTY roots and succeeding the first ever droid, the T-Mobile G1. Both will launch with Android 2.2 Froyo. The Desire Z has an S-LCD screen, while the Desire HD has a regular LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some regions, the HTC Desire HD and Desire Z should be available as soon as next month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire HD hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've been casting envious looks towards the US shores ever since the HTC EVO 4G landed there in June. Well it looks like our prayers have been heard and Europe (and of course the rest of the world) is getting its own GSM-loving EVO. And the best part is that the wait was worth it - the HTC Desire HD comes with a new Snapdragon CPU that should have a huge graphics performance edge over the chip inside the EVO 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire HD comes loaded with some great expectations. Samsung dethroned HTC as the most powerful Android handset manufacturer with the Galaxy S and it's now the Taiwanese company's turn to retaliate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And from what our first impressions show, HTC have done so in style. Their new Android monster of a phone is impressively good looking and really snappy. The metal shell feels great to touch too so it's a phone we would gladly take home. Mind you if you aren't a huge fan of heavy phones you might find it</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the giant LCD screen might not have AMOLED-deep blacks but it makes up for that with brightness and, of course it convincingly wins in terms of sheer size. We are curious how it does when in the sun though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the following video to get a better idea of the HTC Desire HD perfomance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is the unbranded version of the recently announced T-Mobile's G2. Like the original Android, the T-Mobile G1, the Desire Z packs a QWERTY keyboard and rather than a simple slide it uses a clever spring assisted hinge (the "Z Hinge") that keeps the phone thin, despite the hardware keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs on the HTC Desire Z are pretty impressive ? 800MHz CPU, 512MB RAM, Android 2.2 Froyo, 3.7? screen and 5MP camera with 720p video recording. One really cool features that impressed us was Fast Boot ? from off to full boot takes 3-4 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aluminum body feels great and the Z hinge seems pretty sturdy. The four row QWERTY that it uncovers is comfortable ? the keys are well spaced, with good feedback and even the often troublesome top row has plenty of room to breathe. This puts it in competition with the likes of Motorola Milestone 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire Z is one hefty piece of kit ? 119 x 60.4 x 14.2 and weighs 180 grams. It?s about the same dimensions as the Nokia E7 we saw yesterday. Where the Nokia has an advantage in terms of screen size (3.7? for the HTC vs. 4.0? for the Nokia), the Desire Z makes up for with higher resolution ? 480x800 pixels. The picture is appreciably sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the following video you can see a demo of that ultra fast boot - we power off the phone and then power it up again - it's not asleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Desire HD, the HTC Desire Z will be exclusive to Vodafone in some markets and should be available next month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the two Android super phones HTC announced a new version of their HTC Sense user interface. The company is quite keen on differentiating its products and not becoming just another of the Android crew and they seem to have put quite a lot of effort in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Sense modifies many parts of the user interface, including some more frequently used like camera and notification area. The homescreen has also been slightly tweaked but there's hardly much to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we aren't particularly sure that the one-tab camera UI is the best one can find, but it's better than before. And that host of shortcuts in the notification area will certainly need some getting used to but it should all feel quite right when you do get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty brought by the new Sense UI is map pre-caching, which according to the company should put an end on that irritating waiting when zooming in. Instead the handset will start cashing different zoom levels and will load them immediately after you pinch the screen. It does seem like a really resource-hungry task (RAM and internet connection mostly) but the Desire handsets have so much operating memory that this is hardly anything to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most important part of the announcement however was the HTCSense.com website. It was created to provide easy data management between your mobile phone and your computer, plus nice security features such as remote wipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTCSense.com allows you to see your phone's content from any computer as long as you have the required user name and password. You can also make the phone ring so you can find it the next time you misplace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you lose your phone HTCSense.com will allow you to remotely locate it, lock it and if necessary wipe it so your private info doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other minor changes brought by the new Sense include a new in-call screen, remote control functionality etc.. We will give you more details about those when we get the chance to do a full review of the Desire HD or the Desire Z.</paragraph>
