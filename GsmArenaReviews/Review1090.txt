			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Roughly a year after Motorola brought the RAZR franchise back to the masses, we have the second generation of the popular DROID on our hands. The Motorola DROID RAZR HD for Verizon Wireless comes to the market hot on the heels of its frameless baby brother, bringing a few extra tricks to go with the more impressive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is a major improvement over its predecessor. Starting with the 4.7" Super AMOLED screen of HD resolution, all the way to the Snapdragon S4 chipset, the smartphone packs enough punch to keep all but the most demanding users happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of talents which the Motorola DROID RAZR HD has on tap:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even a quick glance at the spec sheet of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is more than enough to show how massive an improvement the newcomer is over its predecessor. At the same time Motorola's designers have been extremely conservative with the looks of the DROID RAZR HD - the smartphone is unmistakably a RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's touch is strongly felt throughout the software of the device - staring with the barely modified UI, all the way to Google Chrome being the default web browser. An update to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean is promised before year's end, so the overly anxious have no reasons to worry about being left with the cold Ice Cream Sandwich for long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we can't help but notice that, even at its launch, the Motorola DROID RAZR HD appears outgunned by some of its competitors in terms of processing power. Quad-core is the talk of town these days and the latest DROID RAZR is not a member of the elite club. Read on to find out if it has enough other talents to overcome its shortage of CPU cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to kick the review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Motorola DROID RAZR HD for Verizon is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unsurprisingly basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD ships in Verizon's cool-looking, square-shaped black retail box. Inside it, you will find a charger, a microUSB cable, and a tool for removing the microSIM and microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bundled headset would have certainly been a welcome sight inside the handset's box. However, it has become the standard among manufacturers to omit the item from the devices' retail packages in US, so we can't blame Motorola for going with the flow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we mentioned already, the Motorola DROID RAZR HD's looks can be immediately traced to the original from last year. Motorola's designers have been careful to preserve the design lineage on this instance. Whether or not they have been a bit too cautious is a matter of personal taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is available in two color schemes - white like our review unit and black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is pretty good and so are the selected build materials. The smartphone is made from Kevlar, metal and Corning Gorilla glass. There are also no gaps between the panels like on the Droid RAZR M and the only room for improvement we see are the sides, which have three different colors and materials on them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the handset are in line for a device of its size. The smartphone stands at 131.9 x 67.9 x 8.4 mm (5.19 x 2.67 x 0.33 in) weighs 146 g (5.15 oz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.7" HD Super AMOLED display of the DROID RAZR HD is a massive improvement over previous Motorola efforts. It retains the deep blacks and vibrant colors we've grown accustomed to and adds extra sharpness for an even more impressive image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We reckon that some might find the PenTile matrix an unwelcome sight and it's true that we've seen slightly sharper screens. With a pixel density of 312ppi however, you'd have to be looking from way closer than it's comfortable to tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera are located above the display. The earpiece and notification light keep them company. There's nothing but a mouthpiece below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB and microHDMI ports are located on the left side. The same goes for the microSIM and microSD cards, which are neatly tucked under a cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side, you will find nothing but power/lock key and the volume rocker. Both buttons are made of metal and feel great when touched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is located on top. There's nothing but two great-looking metal bolts on the bottom of the DROID RAZR HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera, its LED flash, and the loudspeaker are located on the top of the Moto's back. The usual set of Motorola and Verizon logos are also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD's battery is sadly non-removable. With 2500mAh on top though, it is one of the biggest units offered in a smartphone for the time being.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola smartphones have been among the performance benchmarks in our traditional battery test this year and the DROID RAZR HD is no exception. The Verizon handset achieved an endurance rating of 59h in our battery trial. This means that you will need to recharge your handset every 59 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Motorola DROID RAZR HD feels great. The all-Kevlar back feels grippy, so accidental drops are highly unlikely. One-handed operation is a bit of a stretch in some cases, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand a strong case can be made that for some operations you always need two hands (those that involve pinch zooming or other complicated gestures) and for the basics (answering a call or dialing a number) - the RAZR HD can easily be operated with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software talents of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with a light touch by Motorola<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, with very light customizations by Motorola. The overall Android experience is very close to the stock Android - starting from the on-screen Android buttons, all the way to the app drawer and its transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the handset in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first area the interface which has been customized by Motorola is the lock screen. Pressing on the round unlock button gives you option to access four different features of the device - you can unlock it, or go straight to telephony, text messaging or the camera apps. You can also turn the device's sound on and off from the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of side-scrollable panes. Switching between them is seamless, save for the small indicator above the docked icons, which disappears when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding or removing a homescreen pane, you have two options - start with a blank or use a preset one. The preset ones are geared towards specific activities such as social networking, entertainment, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing homescreen panes is as easy as swiping them upwards. No surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a true Ice Cream Sandwich fashion, long pressing the homescreen gives you the option to change the handset's wallpapers. You can do so for both the lock and the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has been taken straight from the stock version of Android ICS. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets - that house side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Google Play store shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create folders in the familiar ICS way. All you have to do is swipe the icon over the one you want to pair it with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must note that there aren't many preloaded widgets. However, Motorola's own Circles widget is one of the most comfortable ones we've encountered. It offers you access to the clock, weather in different cities, as well as a battery indicator. Customization is also possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the device's homescreen to the left reveals a menu with quick settings. From there, you can change the most commonly used connectivity settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. We found this shortcut particularly handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is taken straight from the stock ICS UI. It shows you icons next to the notification, such as the picture of the person who called or messaged you. There's a Settings shortcut to make up for the fact that you can't go Menu &gt; Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recent apps list is stock ICS one - it displays thumbnails of the running application rather than its icon and it's a vertical, scrollable list. You can dismiss apps with a simple swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user interface experience with the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is quite pleasant. The UI has been customized lightly, but cleverly. This helps it retain a lot of pure Googleness to it - not a bad thing in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the DROID RAZR HD is yet another example of Verizon Wireless doing its best to ruin a perfectly fine user experience. The amount of preinstalled, non-removable software is completely out of line. With the usual set of Verizon bloatware, you will find a number of non-removable shopping apps such as Amazon, Amazon MP3, and Zappos. We do believe that it is up to the user to decide whether or not he needs those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is the same as the one found in many top shelf devices currently on the US market, including the Galaxy S III. The DROID RAZR HD posted commendable benchmark results, matching its competitors on virtually all occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the web browser-based based benchmarks weren't quite so good. Motorola made a big deal about Google Chrome being the default browser and how fast it is, but the RAZR HD test results were less than impressive. Maybe Chrome is just unable to perform as well as expected outside of its natural Jelly Bean habitat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock ICS phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD is mostly a standard Android ICS affair. The middle tab is the default - a list of all contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first. The other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbs friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any issues with the signal and call quality of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD. As expected, the phone did a commendable job on this instance, thanks to Verizon's superb network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled on the handset, which is great as it spares you the time to go into your phonebook or a specific contact widget to find a contact. It shows only one matching contact at a time - you can use the down arrow to reveal all the suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent calls tab is straightforward in terms of functionality. The favorites tab is neat, as it allows you to dial the contacts with a single tap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is brimming with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is a standard ICS operation. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. You can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are presented with two text input options out of the box. The first one is the standard Android ICS keyboard which is really good. The popular Swype keyboard is also preinstalled. In case these two don't cut it for you, the Google Play store is full of options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD is equipped with a stock Android ICS gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, which are two per line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above each photo you have several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the DROID RAZR HD is the stock Android one. It supports most popular video formats such as XviD and MKV. You can access the videos straight from the gallery app - there's no dedicated video player button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the Motorola DROID RAZR HD (as the name suggests) is perfect for consumption of video content. Large files are also handled easily by the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD comes with the latest Music app by Google. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Ice Cream Sandwich. Naturally, it offers a link to the Google Play music store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the track's album art with the track info and playback controls below it. You can tap it to reveal more options - like/unlike the song, a bar to scrub through the song and shuffle and repeat toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD audio output was very similar to that of its smaller brother - the DROID RAZR M. Save for the slightly shaky frequency response, the smartphone did well in our audio quality test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers very good signal-to-noise and dynamic range scores as well as low distortion levels and very little stereo crosstalk. Add the excellent volume levels and you get a really solid overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera could have done better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD is equipped with an 8MP camera which takes photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash to help out in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is simple. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/back and photo/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken (with a counter of remaining photos next to it) and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a retractable row of shortcuts at the bottom - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot, panorama or self-timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro, HDR or an Auto mode which decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a widescreen option that produces 16:9 photos. With it, both the viewfinder and the gallery images fit the screen aspect perfectly in full screen mode. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio means the photos turn out at roughly three quarters of the original resolution at about 6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures which the DROID RAZR HD captures offer very little resolved detail and high noise levels. The camera samples have the dreaded oil-painting look when looked at anything close to 100%. On the other hand - when downsized the fairly accurate (although slightly dull) colors and dynamic range make the shots pretty decent. Overall it's a below par performance for an 8MP camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks identical to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio scenes, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured by the DROID RAZR HD came out smooth, but with washed out colors. The resolved detail is only average and so is contrast. It is not the worst performance we have seen, but miles from the best too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample captured with the DROID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 1080p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has you covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like a proper top shelf Android smartphone, the Motorola DROID RAZR HD checks just about every box in the connectivity department. Along with the EVDO/CDMA network capacity, it offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band HSDPA potentially reaching speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA, and 5.76 HSUPA. Sadly, the GSM capabilities are only available with Verizon's roaming outside the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Verizon's superb LTE network connectivity is also on board. Where available, it is a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (with DLNA support) and Bluetooth 4.0 with LE. The mobile hotspot functionality is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wired connectivity, there's a microUSB port and microHDMI port at your service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with Android Beam preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is your default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser. It offers arguably the best experience on Android, even though its speed marks left something to be desired. Still, we doubt it you will be looking too hard for the stock ICS browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having left the Beta realm for some time now, Google Chrome on your Moto syncs seamlessly with your desktop, thus allowing for easily switching tasks between your smartphone and any other device you have, running Google's browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (both 2003 and 2007 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to a desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen. The best part here is that you can tap to turn the light almost all the way down - with only the time staying on the display just bright enough to see it (it's much easier to see in the dark). This is a very power-efficient mode and you can actually use the phone as a desk clock without worrying about killing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a file manager on board as well - it can browse both the internal 16GB memory and the microSD card. Also, there's support for browsing shared folders on the Wi-Fi network you're connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a really clever app called Smart Actions - it allows you to create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.). There are several sample actions that are useful in various situations but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with applications and video games, you can also access and purchase movies, music, books and magazines (where available).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD is a one of the most well-rounded packages on the market right now. The handset offers good performance and great battery life, tucked into a well-built, nice looking package. With Google pulling the strings at the company now, we are all but certain that the smartphone will extend the good software experience with timely OS updates too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where we found the Motorola DROID RAZR HD to be lacking is processing power. It?s not that the smartphone is slow, but its competitors all come with notably more capable chipsets and it shows more often than you might think. The PenTile matrix of the display isn?t ideal either, but we reckon this one isn?t as bad. Most users will have a hard time telling the difference, while on the other hand everyone will see the great contrast and the nicely saturated colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera is also far from the best shooters out there. The specs are all there, but the output came way behind the main rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR HD is priced at $199.99 with a two-year contract with Verizon Wireless. This puts the smartphone in the middle of the most heated battle on the US smartphone market as this is the price point where every manufacturer has thrown its best device. Just take a look as the kind of elite competition the RAZR HD faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is one of the strongest rivals of the DROID RAZR HD at the moment. It is priced at $199.99 as well, but offers twice the oomph and way sharper screen. The Optimus G is available to AT&amp;T and Sprint Wireless, so we guess this one also depends on your preference of carrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus G E970 &#x2022; LG Optimus G LS970</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III is available on all major carriers, and on some of them it could be found for just $99.99. It does have slightly shorter battery life (though it?s pretty good on its own, particularly after the Jelly Bean update), and a far superior camera. The Galaxy S III also outdoes its Motorola rival in terms of functionality with cool home-brewed tricks like Smart stay, direct call etc. On the other hands the Nature UX is a bit too colorful for some people and they might prefer the more toned-down UI of the DROID RAZR.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC One X+ is also just around the corner. The AT&amp;T-bound smartphone offers quad-core Tegra 3 beef, Android Jelly Bean out of the box, and more built-in memory (although it lacks microSD card slot for cheap expansion). The One X+ will likely be priced the same as the RAZR HD.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, if you are a bargain hunter, you will find a gem in Motorola?s own stable. The well-rounded (literally as well) Motorola Atrix HD for AT&amp;T offers plenty of bang for its 100-buck asking price. In most cases we?d say you are better off with the Galaxy S III, but if the PenTile matrix ruins the deal for you, you might as well consider this one.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, all in all, the Motorola DROID RAZR HD?s biggest problem isn?t that it?s not a solid device. Just the opposite ? it?s an excellent performer that is only bound to get better when the updates start coming in (and when you have Google?s word for it, you know they will come in). However, on current merit, it?s hard to recommend it over the established players in the game.</paragraph>
