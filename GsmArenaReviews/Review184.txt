			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson announced several new phones yesterday and we managed to snatch the Sony Ericsson C510 Cyber-shot and Sony Ericsson W715 Walkman for quick and dirty hands-on session. Now those two are certainly not final retail versions, so we won't be putting them through our full reviewing routine. Just remember - this is a short preview, not a full-blown review article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 Walkman is a Wi-Fi/GPS-enabled slider made exclusively for Vodafone. It's is practically identical to the Sony Ericsson G705 that we already reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi (with DLNA), GPS receiver, a 3 megapixel snapper with geotagging and an accelerometer that allows for auto screen rotation and motion gaming are its main selling points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the W715 is loaded with Walkman goodies such as the latest Walkman music player, TrackID, SenseMe and Shake control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support plus dual-band UMTS/HSPA 9100/1200 connectivity and will be available in Galactic Black and Luxury Silver color combos. For our preview we received the Luxury Silver one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 Cyber-shot has a 2.2-inch QVGA scratch-resistant display, quad-band GSM support plus tri-band UMTS/HSPA connectivity. On board there's an accelerometer for auto screen rotation and motion gaming plus an M2 memory card slot and stereo Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meant as an affordable cameraphone, the Sony Ericsson C510 has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera with Face detection and Smile shutter. There's no xenon flash as you might have guessed it (only a LED one) and you can get geotagging but only by cell triangulation, as there's no actual GPS receiver in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 Cyber-shot will be available Q1 2009 in Future Black and Radiation Silver. We got the Radiation Silver variety for our article.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 represents the latest and greatest in the realm of Sony Ericsson Walkmans. It looks just like the Sony Ericsson W705, but adds GPS to the equation. This way it gets identical to the Sony Ericsson G705, but being a Vodafone-only device, the two will probably evade direct competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman pedigree ensures that the Sony Ericsson W715 has the latest and greatest in Sony Ericsson spoiling music features such as Shake control and SenseMe, while GPS and Wi-Fi are the icing on of the cake.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W715 design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 is a compact device and has a relatively large 2.4-inch display. The frame around the display is made of brushed metal, while everything else is plastic. The materials used seem really nice and add to the W715 an air of luxury.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4-inch display is as far as Sony Ericsson feature phones go, so you will be getting the company's best with the W715. The Flash user interface graphics really looks nice on the display. But we hope to see even bigger displays from Sony Ericsson. Multimedia needs screen estate, there's no doubt about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys below the display have a well known design and positioning so there are no surprises here. Their usability is on a nice level, but the same goes for the ultra flat alpha-numeric keypad. Press feedback is great and the individual keys have enough elevation so that touch orientation is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W715 lacks any external music keys if you don't count the D-pad. There is a Walkman music player key on top of the device but it doesn't work if the phone is locked (slider closed) and when you slide open the slider it's really hard to get to due to the front panel covering it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel has the same locking mechanism as some previous Sony Ericsson models, and is identical to the one of the recent G705 and W705. The locking mechanism is a really nice idea, but the downer is that as the memory card slot is under the back cover and when you want to get to it, sliding the lock is another extra step that gets on your nerves with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3 megapixel camera lens is on the back the W715. Right next to is there is single LED flash, which proved really underpowered for low light shooting, unless you're doing macro shots perhaps. There is no self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W715 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You won't be surprised by the Sony Ericsson user interface. It's still the best feature phone interface in its class and the only thing it currently lacks is an office document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite themes support is one of its greatest advantages and the Sony Ericsson W715 comes with several of them - of course you are free to download more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, you can enjoy auto screen rotation in the multimedia menu as well as in the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have been integrating a really nice YouTube client in all of their mid- to high-end phones. The client is present here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the phones announced yesterday by Sony Ericsson also have one new feature - it's the conversation style SMS/MMS displaying or otherwise threaded SMS/MMS. The conversation style messages resemble instant messengers. Similar message layout has already been offered by Apple iPhone and Windows Mobile 6.1 devices. With the Sony Ericsson solution (as well as with WM 6.1), you can choose which layout should be the default one - the regular old type or the new conversation style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Sony Ericsson W715 and C510 have that feature (we suppose future phones too), and the Sony Ericsson C905 will be getting it too via that all-important software update we told you about yesterday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera. The interface of the camera is the usual Cyber-shot stuff, with only a few things missing here and there. Geotagging is among the available features - thanks to the built-ing GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are interested in sample camera images form the W715, you will fond those on the last page of this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the W715 is a bit of a letdown. Its video recording of QVGA@15fps is only good for MMS purposes if you as us. The C510 has better video recording, but we'll say more about it on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, there's GPS on board the W715. That's the reason why it gets the full Location services suite including Google Maps and in our case - the Wayfinder Navigator. We are not really sure whether the final version will have the Wayfinder Navigator too, as the official press release said that the Vodafone-only W715 will use their own navigation software called Vodafone Find&amp;Go besides Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 comes with a few extra applications, the most interesting of which are AccuWeather Lite for providing weather info, CamPlus for taking automatically a succession of images and Walk Make, which is a step counting application with detailed reports on past activity. Unfortunately, it's only relatively accurate in counting your steps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 is Cyber-shot-bred cameraphone with reasonable thickness and a big metallic camera lens cover that keeps a low profile but allows the handset to really stand out of the crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general impression that C510 can give you is as if you have a budget variant of the popular Sony Ericsson C902 in your hands. Even the sides of both phones are styled similarly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C510 design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front side of the C510 certainly doesn't amaze with original design, but obviously Sony Ericsson are pretty insistent on keeping their phones easily recognizable (even if boringly identical).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2-inch QVGA display of the Sony Ericsson C510 is definitely not small for a "really affordable cameraphone", but we somehow feel that the Sony Ericsson UI really shines on bigger screens such as the one of W715. So far 2.4-inch screens are as large as Sony Ericsson feature phones go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is relatively comfortable and we like the way it responds to presses. As you can see the keys are sufficiently large, so we won't be expecting problems in that department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 is entirely made of plastic although the silvery color may mislead you at first glance. The only thing we found truly made of metal on the phone is the camera lens cover. It's got a really nice brushed finish and most of us really liked the original low-profile design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pretty pleased with the handling and construction of the Sony Ericsson C510. While its design didn't manage to win all our team members, but as you know, that thing is pretty subjective.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C510 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 user interface won't surprise anyone and you would find all things that we already said about the W715 true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 has support for Flash Lite themes and has several of them preinstalled. Auto screen rotation in selected parts of the interface is also available thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the W715, the Sony Ericsson C510 has the YouTube client preinstalled and integrated in the Media Center. The new conversation-srtyle SMS/MM feature we showed you on W715, is also present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a true Cyber-shot, the Sony Ericsson C510 is mostly all about the camera. Dubbed as the most affordable Cyber-shot cameraphone to date, the C510 still offers some nice camera features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no BestShot, but you have a dedicated Panorama mode plus face detection and the special Sony Ericsson Smile Shutter intended of getting all-smiley group or portrait shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally there's an option for geotagging the photos taken by using cell triangulation, which is a relatively accurate (up to several blocks) way to still have your photos location-signed without a real GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we wondered if the Sony Ericsson C510 is as good as the now elderly Sony Ericsson K810, we did an impromptu camera shootout. You can see all about it on the next page. For now, we'll just give you a quick taster of how the C510 performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video recording, the C510 is certainly not an impressive performance. Still, the Cyber-shot lineage has played its role and the C510 records QVGA vide at 30 fps. Such video clips are usable in everyday situations, they generally look really nice on screen and they can even do YouTube. But still, that doesn't change the fact that Sony Ericsson are still seriously lagging behind in the vide recording department throughout their whole portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample Sony Ericsson C510 video for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Location services menu is present on the Sony Ericsson C510, but as the handset lacks GPS, it has some cut-down functionality. There's only Google Maps preinstalled here and there's no sign of the Sports Tracker application. Most stuff in the menu however are best used with an external Bluetooth GPS receiver (third-party or by Sony Ericsson) that's optional and relatively inexpensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C510 doesn't have that much applications preinstalled, but typical Cyber-shot comes with the well-known Photo Mate application that's a nicely made photo helper tool full of tips for shooting various tricky scenes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since we had several 3 megapixel handset on our hands, we decided to make an impromptu camera shootout between the Sony Ericsson C510 and the Sony Ericsson W715 and we threw in some samples from the now elderly Sony Ericsson K810 just for the fun of it. Finally, you'll see that Nokia 5800 XpressMusic also enters the competition, though quite unsuccessfully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here are the photos produced by the 3 megapixel cameras of all the four handsets in today's shootout. The Sony Ericsson K810 still seem to lead the pack, although now retired. The C510 is close behind but still leads the Sony Ericsson W715. The disappointing Nokia 5800 XpressMusic trails far behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't be getting into detailed image quality analysis as the C510 and W715 quite understandably are not final units and there can be a lot of improvements along the way to market availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we went to test the camera flash performance. The Sony Ericsson K810 is the only one equipped with a xenon flash. The Sony Ericsson C510 and the Nokia 5800 have dualLED flashes, while the Sony Ericsson W715 is obviously underpowered with its single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The following test shows the flash performance of all four phones from approximately 1m distance:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second flash test shows the flash performance from an approximate distance of 2.5m:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We enjoyed having the Sony Ericsson W715 and C510 with us. They may not be ground-breaking devices, but they are solid-built, no-non-sense handsets that use one of the best feature phone interfaces available on the market and that has now gotten even more rich in functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W715 Walkman is so much close to being the G705 twin, that at first we hardly imagined a place for it under the sun. But, as it seems being a Vodafone-exclusive device is a good reason for any mobile phone to come into being and we like that operators are offering more and more advanced cell phones at subsidized prices. So in the end, the W715 Walkman might not be an effort in vain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C510 on the other hand comes with the latest interface revision (think YouTube and threaded SMS/MMS) and has borrowed features from the top Cyber-shot dogs (face detection and smile shutter). The svelte camera lens cover and the promise of being one of the most affordable Cyber-shots, would surely assure it a nice market position even though it lacks a xenon flash and is just a notch behind in image quality than the now elderly Sony Ericsson K810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we had a nice experience with both mobiles, and we are looking forward to seeing how they will perform in real life once they go retail as finished products.</paragraph>
