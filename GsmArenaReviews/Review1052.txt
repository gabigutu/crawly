			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the LTE networks rapidly increase their reach globally, support for them is no longer exclusively reserved for high-end devices. The HTC One SV is a clear example of this trend. The Android smartphone is far from the Taiwanese company's top shelf offerings. Instead, the handset aims to offer affordable LTE goodness, packed in a well put together, fairly affordable package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As its name unambiguously suggests, the spec sheet of the HTC One SV is a blend between the HTC One S and the HTC One V internals, thus a mixture of old and new. The handset packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset, whose dual-core 1.2GHz CPU is quite leggy even for today's Android smartphone standards. Its 4.3" display on the other hand comes straight from 2010 with its WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's take a deeper look at the full list of talents which the HTC One SV possesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the chipset and the connectivity options are up to today's standards, the WVGA display of the HTC One SV certainly raised our brows. However, having such a resolution does have its benefits too. The smartphone feels quite zippy, as its GPU has to deal with a relatively moderate amount of pixels. The battery certainly doesn't mind the arrangement too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This far, the HTC One SV identity has us a bit puzzled. The smartphone is clearly neither an entry-level offering, nor a fully blown mid-range device. So, has HTC entered a new market niche with the One SV? Read on to find out! As always, we will kick things off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package not worth bragging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the retail box of our Cricket Wireless branded HTC One SV, we found a charger, a USB cable, and a 4GB microSD card. In line with most US market devices, there are no headphones included in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are quite certain that the retail package of the HTC One SV will vary depending on the region of availability. With this caveat in mind, don't be surprised if you encounter headphones in the handset's box in your area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV is certainly a good looking smartphone, particularly in the screaming red color scheme which we got to experience. The device sports curvy edges and a metal ring which goes around its body. The earpiece grille and its loudspeaker counterpart increase the sense of a product well-crafted even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is unsurprisingly superb. The One SV's back cover is made of soft-feel plastic, while the entire front of the device is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 2. Add the metal ring going around the phone's edges and the HTC One SV feels just about as premium as it gets these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to its relatively modest display size, the HTC One SV sports measures which are likely to appeal to every pocket. They are 128 x 66.9 x 9.2 mm, while the handset's weight tips the scale at the quite acceptable 122 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3" WVGA display of the device is arguably the weakest link in its armor. While its Super LCD2 nature ensures great color reproduction, viewing angles and contrast, its low resolution and pixel density of 217ppi are far from HTC's finest efforts even by 2011 standards. Separate pixels are easy to spot, particularly when reading text and web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upside of having a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels on board can be seen in the battery and CPU and chipset performance. We will tell you more about both further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is where the stylish earpiece grille resides, accompanied by the front-facing camera, the ambient light, and the proximity sensors. Below the display is the usual for all HTC smartphones trio of capacitive buttons. In the case of our review unit, they glow in a pleasant red color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left side of the device. On the right, you will find the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key, 3.5mm audio jack, and a secondary microphone are all located on top of the HTC One SV. The microUSB port and mouthpiece are on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera and its single LED flash are located in the top part of the device's back. The loudspeaker grille is on the bottom. Naturally, you also get to see a massive HTC logo, along with a Beats Audio one and, in our case, some Cricket Wireless branding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover is where the user-replaceable 1800mAh battery, the microSIM and microSD cards reside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV achieved an endurance rating of 38 in our traditional battery test. This means that you will need to recharge your phone every 38 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the HTC One SV is an absolute pleasure. Due to its size, the smartphone offers superb one-hand ergonomics, which is a rarity with high-end Android smartphones these days. The soft-feel back feels grippy enough, so accidents are unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we give high marks to the HTC One SV for design, build quality and ergonomics. The display could surely have been better, but if the price point is right, many users will likely not frown at it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android ICS with HTC Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV comes with Android 4.0.4 and Sense 4.1. At a time, when Android Jelly Bean is quickly becoming the standard for new devices in all tiers, we did find the presence of ICS in the One SV a bit odd. We've seen this particular combo of ICS and Sense several times already on the HTC One series phones, so don't be surprised if it looks familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the UI in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is quite functional. There are the usual four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You can either drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone, or any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is at your service - tap the home key (while on the default homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out (with an awesome animation) to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes. A small "home" icon indicates the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the homescreen, you get an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a brand new dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have as many as seven homescreens - and with all the excellent preloaded widgets, you might want to keep all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense UI offers one of the most full-featured customization suites around. The proprietary Scenes interface lets you choose from various custom homescreen setups, which provide new wallpaper and widget sets that can be further customized to suit your needs. This version of Sense only comes with one preloaded, but hitting the 'Get More' button on the upper right will take you to the HTC Hub where you can download additional Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you want to quickly change your phone's setup, such as going from work to home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements. The One SV comes with a total of two preloaded skins, although like with Scenes, it's easy to get more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Drawer uses a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in a similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes since Sense went ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main problem here is with how widgets are selected - they are shown four at a time and there's a lot of scrolling involved. Widgets are available in multiple versions - usually differing in size, but also functionality - and they're all dumped into the list, so you're scrolling through a lot of duplicates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two fields appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You can drop the widget on either one to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it is highlighted, Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area no longer has the list of recent apps - it's reserved for notifications only. No more tabs and toggles either, although you get a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the task switcher button on any screen displays a list of all your recently accessed apps, which you can remove with a swipe to the left or right. This is really just a quick way to access apps you've used recently, as swiping away doesn't kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To actually terminate a running app, you have to close it via the traditional task manager we've become familiar with from Gingerbread. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Stop All button too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset with two 1.2 GHz Krait cores and Adreno 305 GPU. The smartphone also offers 1GB worth of RAM, which adds up to a pretty good combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi focuses on the CPU's per-core calculative performance. The One SV took advantage of its Krait cores and posted an excellent score here, even if its lower clock speed prevented it from coming near the best we have seen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the overall performance benchmark Quadrant the One SV posted an incredible score beating lots of quad-core droids and equaling the score of the Samsung Galaxy S III. The lower resolution has certainly helped in the graphics part of the test, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider and BrowsermMark test the Javascript performance, while BrowserMark adds a touch of HTML 5. The One SV aced both tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So obviously the HTC One SV is a pretty good performer, fighting it out with way more expensive smartphones when it comes to synthetic performance. More importantly it does very well in real life and pushes the Sense 4.1 over Ice Cream Sandwich quite fast. There were no hiccups to speak off though the One SV wasn't as smooth as the Project Butter Jelly Bean droids.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does a solid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One SV has HTC's elaborate phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have your contact list, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Google contacts, Facebook, or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and the fourth one called "Gallery" pulls up all the albums that contact has created on Flickr or Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. You can link to another contact or Facebook account pressing the "chains" icon in the upper right of the main contact screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transfer app is here to help you switch from your old phone. It supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth. It's an old but useful feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the One SV displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keypad, contacts will be filtered by name and by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the One SV displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One SV packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone over when ringing will mute the ringer, turning it over in a call will activate the loudspeaker, and there's a Pocket mode to boosts ringing volume when the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the One SV are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's the Google+ Messenger, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the One SV boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. Texting takes a bit of getting used to in portrait mode, which is understandable given the small screen size. Still, it's enough to get the job done and things get a little better if you flip the phone to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can either add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple mail services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the One SV lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android-ish gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery is a custom job, but stacks photos just like the vanilla Android gallery. The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can choose to show/hide camera shots, All photos or All videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Albums dropdown lets you view local or online albums. On the cloud side, you get Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, Picasa or SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos. Some files have an icon indicating it's not a still photo but a video instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'll need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom up to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player onboard the HTC One SV, which means that video files have to be accessed via the Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video interface offers a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video support on the One SV was a mixed bag - as expected, 1080p videos were a no go and 720p were quite choppy. It was able to play most standard resolution file formats we threw at it - AVI, MP4, MKV - though it did choke on some old XviD-encoded AVI videos. DivX had problems with audio sync but worked fine with AAC audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio, HTC enhancer or No effects (as long as you are using a pair of headphones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available, although you have to have a subtitle file in the same directory as the video to be able access the subtitle options. These include the ability to select a subtitle file (if there is more than one in the same directory), as well as adjust the character encoding, which can be useful in getting those non-Latin subtitles to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can also opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One SV offers the Beats Audio sound enhancement to boost the sonic experience, although at a slightly dumbed-down variant. Gone are all the Beats Audio presets we're used to in other HTC Beats phones, all you're really able to do on the One SV is toggle it on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a widget that shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can pause playback or skip tracks directly by pressing the relevant button but you cannot unlock the phone into the full featured Music Player by dragging the widget into the ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can play the sound through the headphones or the loudspeaker, although you need to have a headset plugged in at all times as it's used as an antenna. There's no Beats enhancement here though, or a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a data connection, you can use TuneIn online radio instead of relying on your local FM radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV audio output came out pretty good. The smartphone had excellent frequency response and garnished it with good dynamic range, noise level and stereo crosstalk readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume levels were only average, but since the distortions were kept well under control the overall performance is more than satisfactory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shared camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV packs a 5MP auto-focus camera that does stills of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There is a LED flash, but unfortunately no shutter key, which would've been useful given the presence of autofocus. At least, touch focusing is present, so you can use that instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - they don't just look alike, the camera just has the UI shared between both functions, with the option to either take a video or snap a still image all from one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo/video taken. On the left are the buttons for toggling the general settings and shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the virtual shutter button. To record a video, you tap the button below it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on), while the shot mode button offers just a few very limited options - portrait, landscape, and low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV photos turn out somewhat of a mixed bag. There is virtually no noise as everything is covered up by a noise suppression algorithm. Unfortunately, the noise suppression smudges literally all the fine detail in its path. To compensate for this fact, HTC has applied a rather strong sharpening filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting photos look good when fit to a computer screen's resolution but don't hold up their own under a closer inspection. At 100% magnification oversharpening seems to be a notable issue, but once you zoom out again to Fit to Screen, it becomes less noticeable and the photos appear nice and punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess most users who are only going to share downsized versions of their photos on Facebook and the likes will be pretty content with the results in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The videos by the HTC One SV turn up quite nice. There is stereo audio and the frame rate is steady 30fps so everything is smooth. The video bitrate is around 10Mbps, which is somewhere at the bottom of the ladder as far as 1080p clips go - the LG Nexus 4 uses 12Mbps, the iPhone 5 - 16Mbps, and the Galaxy S III - 17Mbps. Still, detail is on a relatively nice level and we don't have specific grounds for criticism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an an untouched 1080p video sample video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ample connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G, as well as LTE connectivity. Local wireless connectivity features Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are the most used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. You can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great ICS browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV comes with the company's own Android web browser, as well as Google Chrome preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser controls keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. You get the standard Menu dropdown on the right, but HTC have thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen (you have to pan to reveal them, which is a little annoying).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is also on board and it's quite good. We do believe most users will opt for it as default browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC One SV, with a mobile Office app to boot, that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word, Excel documents and presentations. There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can format the text style and color, justify the text, do lists (numbered or bullet points) in the Word editor. The Excel editor does support function editing, which some mobile editors don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also integrates with Dropbox and SkyDrive, which makes syncing documents between your computer and your phone a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), one you sync with your computer and easily show/hide events you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One SV features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app. There's a world clock, to display the time in multiple locations, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo's weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation and location with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). To assist the GPS you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which makes things even faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV also features car mode. It works in landscape mode and offers large buttons for easy access to telephony, music player, navigation, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One SV packs a curious personality, that's for sure. The handset combines good looks (especially in the red color scheme), superb build quality, rich set of features, and adequate performance all in one - those are qualities which HTC smartphones are well known for. Even an Android power user should be able to live with the handset on a daily basis without having much to complain about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the phone's disadvantages go, we must note that they are highly atypical for an HTC device in this particular price range. We are still scratching our heads over the display's WVGA resolution - after all, it was HTC, which first started offering phones with the higher-res qHD screens back when WVGA was still considered the standard in 2011.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera could have offered much better performance, too - it is not up to par with what the camcorder has to offer. And our remark has nothing to do with the relatively low megapixel count it has on tap - there are plenty of fine 5MP snappers out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we find the lack of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean out of the box puzzling, given that the OS has been around for more than six months now. We're guessing that HTC have skimped on the latest Android on purpose in order to keep the One SV from cannibalizing the sales of its own higher-end models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of sales, you can pick up an HTC One SV in European markets such as Germany and the UK, where LTE is on offer, for about 350 euro. The price tag makes the device relatively affordable for what it has to offer, so long as you consider the LTE connectivity a must-have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If real 4G data speeds are not what you are necessarily after, there is a plethora of Android smartphones, which can give you a lot more than the HTC One SV. They are mostly top dogs from 2012 and include HTC's own One S, the LG Optimus 4X HD, and the Sony Xperia P. Spec for spec, each of those will offer you a lot more than the HTC One SV, save for the LTE functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC One S &#x2022; LG Optimus 4X HD P880 &#x2022; Sony Xperia P</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the United States, the HTC One SV is offered by Cricket Wireless for $350 without a contract commitment, as long as you use the carrier's affordable LTE plans. Such an arrangement makes the smartphone a lot more appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC One SV is not quite an entry-level Android smartphone. The handset however, is likely to serve its purpose well, that is offer LTE connectivity at a fairly affordable price. The latter will make it a perfect companion for the right user. Those, who are not looking specifically for 4G speeds will be better off looking at the alternatives, including the ones in HTC's own stable.</paragraph>
