			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL goes where Asha never dared, 5" screen territory. Windows Phone itself only recently got there, but the Nokia X family is really an extension of touchscreen Asha "smartphones" rather than a failsafe in case Windows Phone get messed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We say Asha "smartphones" because that's what Nokia chooses to call them even if no one else would. Even the Finns eventually had to acknowledge the limitations of platform - QVGA resolution kept screens tiny and the app ecosystem never had much promise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X software is based on the Android Open Source Project, just the OS without any of the Google stuff. The more advanced software has opened doors to bigger, higher resolution screens and modern, up-to-date apps, plus more powerful hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ease of customization also let the company create a unique, Nokia experience with a blend of Nokia and Microsoft services filling in for the missing Google goodies that we are accustomed to seeing on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the summary of what the Nokia XL has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs aren't meant to impress but, as an Asha alternative, the Nokia XL prioritizes price over features. Indeed, the XL and its siblings are cheaper than the revered Moto G (barring temporary discounts and promotions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shouldn't discount the value of Nokia's premium services - HERE maps with free offline navigation, MixRadio, Glance Screen and double-tap to wake (trademark features that go way back). A familiar brand name also counts for a lot, considering the Android low end is getting populated with small brands with only the Lumia 520 / 525 to fight back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Nokia Lumia 520 has dropped to stunning prices of &#x20ac;100, that's not without some subsidies from Nokia, Microsoft or both to boost WP market share. The Nokia XL and its two shorter siblings instead deliver hardware at its actual price, no catch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a race to the bottom that in the long term will only get fiercer as cheap smartphones become "good enough". Is the Nokia XL "good enough" or perhaps even "better"? Flip to the next page and begin to find out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia XL 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL measures 141.4 x 77.7 x 10.9mm, larger than a typical 5" phone. It's a full inch taller and over half an inch wider than the 4" Nokia X. The 1" difference in screen diagonal should have blown up dimensions less than that, meaning the XL has thicker bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 190g of weight is also going to be a serious issue - a 5.7" Samsung Galaxy Note 3 weighs only 168g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL wouldn't look out of place next to a Lumia 520 or an Asha 501. The phone uses elements from the design of both phones in several places, including both hardware and software. It's bigger than both, something that is instantly obvious in person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the screen bezels on the Nokia XL are thicker than those on the Nokia X or a typical 5" phone. Having grown used to large devices we didn't mind the size much, surprisingly even the 190g weight felt okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia typically makes heavier than average phones, but it has built itself a reputation for rock solid durability. The Nokia XL has a similar tough feel to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the front features a flat, black glass with the colorful polycarbonate of the back forming a thin border around the glass to give the phone a bit of character. The only button on the front is a capacitive back button similar to the recent Asha 50x phones and unlike a typical Android phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of software customization means you don't need the Home and App switcher buttons, though that doesn't necessarily make them redundant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, a 2MP front-facer is a first for the lineup - both the X and X+ forego the secondary cam. The earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensors are also above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display has the Glance Screen feature, similar to Lumia phones and Nokias of old (plus Motorola's Active Display). Basically, it keeps the display on but in a low power mode, so it displays a clock and notifications without burning through the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia XL is made of soft touch polycarbonate, a long-standing Nokia trademark. It's a high quality material that we prefer over the plastic of certain older flagships. The covers are exchangeable, letting you customize your phone with the following colors: orange (the one we have), bright green, cyan, yellow, black and white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back is a 5MP autofocus camera with LED flash. It's a significant upgrade considering the Nokia X and X+ both have fixed-focus 3.15MP cameras with no flash. The video capture remains unchanged at 480p @ 30fps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the back is the loudspeaker. Under the battery cover is a disappointingly small 2,000mAh battery, which looks tiny compared to the bulk of the Nokia XL. In a couple of chapters we'll explore the battery life in detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The card slots are below the back cover too - a microSD card slot and one or two microSIM card compartments. We have the dual-SIM version of the Nokia XL, though the device has a single-SIM version too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM Asha phones have a hot-swappable second SIM slot, but that's not the case with the Nokia XL. You have to power off the device to remove either card (the battery blocks the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having covered the front and back, what's left is the sides of the phone, which have a very traditional setup. There's a 3.5mm audio jack on top, microUSB port for data and charging at the bottom. The volume rocker and the power key are on the right-hand side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key is low enough to be easy to hit with your thumb, despite the overall height of the phone. Nokia also has a double-tap to wake feature, which is more convenient. It's quite accurate though we did see the phone wake a couple of times from accidental taps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL features a 5" IPS LCD touchscreen of WVGA resolution (480 x 800) and a low pixel density of 187ppi. At the price point, we wouldn't have complained about the resolution too much until recently, but the Moto G and its 720p display (over twice as many pixels as WVGA) changed that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we miss more is perks like Nokia ClearBlack, which is a polarizing filter that diminishes reflections and greatly improves screen legibility in sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seems to be no scratch-proof glass of any kind, certainly not the popular Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the large screen lends itself to comfortably browsing desktop pages, which don't require zooming in too closely. The low pixel density otherwise becomes apparent, with small text almost illegible and medium-sized text looking soft. Thin fonts don't work well, bold or italic text looks off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are surprisingly good for a display in this price bracket, however contrast and colors are not great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is good, we found that setting it at about 50% is usually good enough, but even at full blast it's not enough to overcome the reflectivity of the screen. The Nokia XL has one of the most reflective screens we've seen, earning it a place at the bottom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL doesn't have a tack sharp screen or a blazing fast chipset, but the upside of that should be good battery life. With a 2,000mAh battery we were a bit skeptical, yet the XL proved us wrong with a 62 hour endurance rating. Note that we tested the dual-SIM version of the phone with two SIM cards in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talk time was pretty good nearly 11 hours, although the HTC Desire 600 dual sim did an hour more with a smaller battery. It's the web browsing that was particularly impressive though, 12 hours is about as good as we've seen (another dual-SIM HTC, the 5" Desire 700, did even better).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the video playback time that let the phone down with 6 and half hours. The video player has limited capabilities as we'll see later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, for a dual-SIM device the Nokia XL showed excellent standby performance. This allowed it to top both the Desire 600 and 700 in terms of endurance rating.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android like you've never seen before<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Windows Phone, Nokia purposefully gave up control of the platform after spending piles of cash to make Symbian competitive and failing. Series 40 with its long history had accumulated too much baggage along the way and lacked developer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's why Nokia looked to Android - the OS was well developed, had great developer support and was completely open for Nokia to tinker with. The result is a custom software that mixes good ideas from the Asha UI (Fastlane), Windows Phone (Live tiles) and Android (almost everything else).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has brought Glance Screen on the X platform - it keeps the display on, but in a low power mode so that it can display the time an notifications. Glance Screen is the marketing name for the Lumia handsets that Nokia phones (both S40 and Symbian) have had for a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double-tapping the phone (it doesn't have to be on the screen) will wake it just like pressing the power button will. This reveals a simple but functional lockscreen with the time and date, plus widget-like notifications for missed events. Depending on which side you swipe such notification it will either take you to the relevant app (right) or it'll be dismissed (left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen itself reveals one of the two homescreens - the app drawer and the Fastlane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer on Nokia X looks like a Windows Phone homescreen - all apps shortcuts have the flat, two-color appearance of Live Tiles. They are resizable and you can even change the base color of each tile. What's different is actually none of those tiles is "live" due to the hardware limitations of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This homescreen will list of all your installed apps, so it might get really long if you are lazy not to organize your shortcuts in folders. There is a search field at the very top of this homescreen to help find a shortcut or widget if it gets lost in the mess or is hiding in a folder you forgot to check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standard Android widgets are also supported and apps that come with a dedicated widget, such as the BBM, will also appear in the widget menu too. We suggest not to use too many widgets though because they may noticeably impact the overall system performance. Another downside of widgets is that virtually all of them were designed with Android aesthetics in mind, not Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping horizontally from the app drawer will take you to the other homescreen called Fastlane. Those of you familiar with the Asha user interface will recognize it immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fastlane keeps track of all your recent activity, opened apps go there, recent web pages, along with contacts you've called, messages and emails, calendar events (birthdays, to-dos), recently installed apps, recently shared content, recently taken notes and pictures, radio stations, and even social network posts, replies, likes and goings-on. The music player and the FM radio, if active, will also appear here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fastlane is basically a mix between an app switcher, notification area and a history list. It can be personalized from the Settings menu where you can opt out of some of the services and notifications in case you are getting overloaded with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Items from the Fastlane can be dismissed by long pressing the screen and hitting one of the X buttons that appear. This way you can dismiss both apps and other items here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the single button below the screen is a back button, but if you long press it, it will jump straight to the homescreen, bypassing other screens you might have visited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a separate notification area, which you can pull down form the status bar. It shows notifications for missed events and quick toggles for sound profiles, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contextual menus, if available, are marked with three short horizontal lines at the bottom. They areaccessible by swiping up from the bottom of the display, just like the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called Nokia X platform 1.0.1 UI is based on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The core of Android may be unchanged and relatively old, but at least it got in on Project Butter. There's not much processing power to spare on the Nokia X so Butter is essential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is good, though not as snappy as Android on a more powerful chipset (especially a newer Android version). We examine performance in more detail on the next page.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL has a dual-core processor but that suggests a higher caliber chipset than it has in reality. The Qualcom MSM8225 Snapdragon S4 Play is an old generation Snapdragon with two Cortex-A5 cores at 1GHz and Adreno 203 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XL has 768MB RAM, more than the Nokia X and some recent entry-level Androids (like the Sony Xperia XL), but that still doesn't count for much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start off with the usual - processor benchmarks. Here the Nokia XL isn't last, but only because there's the Nokai X below it. Cortex-A7 devices like the Xperia E1 and Galaxy Grand Neo (dual and quad-core respectively) pull clearly ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4 has a Windows Phone version so we can compare the Nokia XL with the Lumia 625. The dual-core Krait and Adreno 305 in the Lumia surprisingly don't get a much better score. That said, Cortex-A7s on Android do quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant, another full system benchmark, puts the Nokia XL at the bottom (even below the Nokia X).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried GFX Bench 2.7, but that only served to show the Nokia XL will never run high-quality graphics even at its native resolution of 800 x 480. The Moto G is powered by Adreno 305, an entry-level GPU but of the next generation, and it outperformed the Adreno 203 in the Nokia XL nearly four times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slow CPU cores don't bode well for web performance either. While raw JavaScript performance was nothing to write home about, the Nokia XL managed to match the Lumia 625 (running Internet Explorer on Krait cores). The XL comes with a custom Nokia browser (based on Chromium) and as you'll find out later, we weren't terribly impressed with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Nokia XL has just enough performance to run Android. And don't forget this is Android 4.1, which benefits from Project Butter, but 4.2-4.4 brought additional performance enhancements. Project Svelte which landed with 4.4 KitKat reduces RAM usage (so Android works well on 512MB devices), so there's room for improvement with a software update. When one might arrive is another question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Nokia XL works well even for web browsing (as long as you manage your expectations), though gaming will be restricted to casual games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Good phonebook, but syncing takes extra effort<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is divided into three sections that are straightforward and easy to navigate - Groups, Contacts and Favorites. The contact list displays a list of names and pictures only. If there's no picture, a colorful tile with the contact's initials is automatically generated. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a search field at the top and an alphabetical scrubber on the right. Quick Contact functionality available on Android is available on Nokia X too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, mail address, notes, events or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - SIM 1, SIM 2 or the phone memory. Contacts can be copied, moved, linked to another contact or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now comes the issue of syncing - despite being based on Android, the Nokia XL is missing the Google services, so you can't directly sync with your Google account and have your contacts appear. There are multiple ways to resolve that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you can export your contacts from Gmail, copy the file on the phone and use the import function (make sure to check the vCard option). You can use an app instead - the app can either grab the contacts straight from your old phone via Bluetooth or it can actually sync the contacts with Google's servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are free options available in the apps store to do both (plus our unit had Contacts Transfer preinstalled) but we recommend the latter approach. It will keep your XL in sync with your other devices synced with Google, plus there will be an up-to-date off-device copy of your contacts in case you lose your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone app of the Nokia X is pretty straightforward and works well. The app integrates with the Call log and the Dialer, there is a Contacts tab too. The dialer itself is pretty standard, but sadly it doesn't offer smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the dual-SIM version like we did for this review, you get a dedicated the SIM card switching interface in the notification area. It can be accessed from anywhere for easy switching, but you can also just set a default card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each SIM card can be put offline to reduce battery usage and you can assign individual ringtones to the cards. Note that while one card is in a call, the other goes to sleep. You can set up call forwarding though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call screen shows options for the keypad, muting a call, putting it on speaker, holding it and entering contacts. If you leave the in-call screen the status bar will notify you of an ongoing call and within a tap on it you'll be back to the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reception with the Nokia X was consistently excellent and in-call sound was loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've put the Nokia X loudspeaker through our traditional test and we found it loud enough not to miss calls or notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in lets you delete the conversation. Unlike the dialer, here you can search contacts by both name and phone number. Multiple contacts can be added this way. On the dual-SIM version of the Nokia XL, each incoming message has an icon showing which SIM received it and there's a convenient shortcut to toggle between SIMs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose to attach an image, video or audio file or enter an email address instead of a phone number, your message will be automatically converted to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard was a pleasant surprise. It looks the same as on the latest Asha Software Platform, but this time around it supports Swype-like input. There are cool swipe gestures for cut, copy, paste and more (the settings menu has a short help screen for those). The usual Android cursor and virtual cut, copy and paste shortcuts are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the keyboard in landscape mode or turn on handwriting recognition. Spell checking and auto correction are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app looks to be a lightweight version of the default Android client. It supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default email view mode is Inbox (with a Combined inbox option), but Folder view is supported too. Batch operations - delete, move to folder, mark as read and star - are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a whole bunch of instant messenger options available out of the box - from Microsoft's Skype, through Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp, Viber to LINE, WeChat and others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Snappy image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Nokia XL lists all of your photos organized by folder, but it can sort them by Time or Location too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are shown in a grid of three by four that is vertically scrollable. You can use pinch or double tap zoom on individual photos, but you can't change the size of the thumbnails. Editing options include rotating, flipping, cropping, lighting and contrast adjustment and adding color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set images as wallpapers, add them to favorites, see details and start a slideshow from the pull-up context menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asha-like music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL music player has a tabbed interface with tabs for songs, artists, albums and playlists. It has a customizable equalizer with presets and a user setting, plus Bass boost and 3D effect sliders (available only with headphones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen shows the usual controls - shuffle, repeat, play/pause, next and previous songs. There is a scrubber, which you can use to skip parts of the song. Album art is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you exit the music player you get a widget in the Fastlane (with only a play/pause button) and on the lockscreen (with play-pause-skip controls). The lockscreen wallpaper gets is by the song's album art while the player is working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia MixRadio is available, just like on the company's Lumia phones. It features playlists, both automatically generated and handcrafted, and will stream music over the Internet. It has an offline mode too, so you can load the playlist over Wi-Fi rather than use your data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia MixRadio also doubles as an MP3 store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player can't handle HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video app, but all of your videos get listed in the gallery instead. You can share, delete or view detailed information from the swipe-able menu at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL is technically capable of playing 3GP, AVI, MP4 and MKV videos up to 1080p resolution, but even 720p results in lots of jerkiness and dropped frames, so we'd stick to SD if we had to use this one as a portable player. AC3 audio codec are supported, which is nice, but DTS and DD are not. Also note that some videos with supported codecs refused to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers very basic user interface with just a Play/Pause button and a scrubber.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stereo FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia XL comes with a neat and simple interface. It supports manual tuning and automatic scanning for channels (you can bookmark seven of them). The radio will place a widget in the Fastlane just like the music player (except it has no controls whatsoever), but not on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL has a 5MP autofocus camera with LED flash, the only serious camera from the X family. The XL is the only phone of the three with a front-facing camera, a 2MP shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple with the most used options - flash mode, white balance and exposure setting - available right on the viewfinder. From the menu you can also pull out a surprising amount of advanced settings - ISO, sharpness, saturation, noise reduction among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL camera also supports geo-tagging, face detection and color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the Nokia X we weren't expecting much, but the XL pleasantly surprised us. The camera captured a good deal of fine detail, though that came with a good deal of oversharpened noise. We found that the default setting of Sharpness Level 2 is too strong, while Level 0 left the image blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thus the sweet spot is Level 1, which reduces the visible noise without harming the fine detail much. We do wish we had an intermediate option between 0 and 1 though. The Reduce noise toggle had only a minor impact but you might want to try it too (we left it off for these camera samples).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the white balance was too cold for our liking but again you can use the settings to try and tweak it (the daylight option seems to work well for this). We would have preferred if Nokia picked better default settings, but overall with five minutes of tweaking the Nokia XL can be a good 5MP shooter. Nokia might tune the defaults for the retail version, but take a few photos with different settings to find the one you like best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: The camera samples below were shot using the default settings. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia XL is also capable of 180-degree panorama shots at 2500 x 500 resolution maximum (handshake will reduce this resolution as the phone has to crop out bad areas).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We used the default settings to shoot the charts with our review unit. A different white balance option would have fixed the blue tint visible on the second chart, but unfortunately there's no single option that works well for all situations - that's what Auto was meant to be (so it's the mode we used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia XL in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FWVGA video is not up to par<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the still camera update, the Nokia XL is still limited to FWVGA video (that's 854 x 480) shot at 30 frames per second. You can select between different video encoders (H264, H263 or MPEG4), but unfortunately there are no options for sharpness or colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>"Unfortunately" because the video quality leaves something to be desired. The captured detail is quite low, seemingly harmed more by the strong compression than the low resolution (compression artifacts are quite visible). We tried the other video encoders, but those didn't do any better. They all used the same bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL records mono audio and you get a choice between AAC and AMR-WB. AAC is the superior codec in general, the other is the standard for HD voice calls. AAC audio is captured at a good 96Kbps but a disappointingly low sampling rate of 16kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors seem off due to an uncorrected pink spot smack in the middle of the image that throws off the color balance. The continuous autofocus is much too aggressive and refocused constantly, but there's no option to reign it in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download this untouched camera sample - 15s, 4.1MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X supports quad-band GSM/EDGE on both SIM cards and dual-band 3G networks on its primary SIM card. Either SIM can be used for a data connection, but you can't use both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, note that only the SIM1 slot has 3G, so it's best to put the card with the data plan there. There you get HSDPA speeds up to 7.2Mbps and HSUPA up to 5.76Mbps. With SIM2 you're stuck at EDGE speeds. If you have the single-SIM version, you don't need to worry about card placement, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n, which will get you fast data speeds and it doesn't eat into your data plan. Bluetooth 3.0 with EDR handles things like wireless hands-free dongles but also local file sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging. There is no USB on-the-go support, though. Both USB and Bluetooth can be used to share the phone's data connection with a PC, the usual Wi-Fi hotspot option is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customized web browser lacks options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL has Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity comes with the Nokia Browser, instead of the stock AOSP browser (it's still based on Chromium though). Note that unlike the Xpress Browser on other platforms, this one doesn't compress web pages to save on data and speed up load times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is fairly fast and fluid, loads web pages really fast and provides great experience for such a low-end device. There's tabbed browsing but no private mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other important options missing - no favorites (strange, this was available on the Nokia X) find on page, tab syncing, request desktop page. There is only one setting in the advanced menu - turn on/off saving passwords. Flash is not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We recommend looking into a third-party browser that does offer those features (Opera is available).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia XL is decently stocked though it lacks any kind of document viewer. As for the file manager, Astro File Manager is available for free in the Nokia Store and works great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day and week view are also available. Adding an event is very easy - you can set start and end time, reminder, location and repeat interval. The app will sync with multiple online calendars, some of which you can hide to avoid the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses two rotation rings, making it easy to set the time and you can make it go off only on specific days. Multiple alarms are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a number of social networking clients - Facebook and Twitter, Vine too. The major chat apps are represented too (Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, LINE, WeChat) so you can stay in touch with your friends regardless of which service they use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia HERE Maps with voice-guided offline navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia XL comes with an integrated GPS receiver and the company is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table - the unified HERE Maps app, which is pretty much as powerful as its Windows Phone famous sibling (it looks like it too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia HERE Maps is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation for most countries in the world (not just one like on low-end Lumia phones). You can download maps by country or by continent and then the last thing you'll need is to download a voice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that you can use the microSD card slot to store maps. The whole European map is a whopping 7.5GB and as you can imagine that won't fit in the 4GB of built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HERE Maps you can easily plan routes (no data connection needed) and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since Nokia XL doesn't have access to the Google Play Store, Nokia had to come up with its own solution. Nokia Store is the dedicated app repository for the Nokia X Platform. The company claims 75% of all available Android apps are fully compatible with the Nokia X Platform, the developers just need to submit their APK file to the store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remaining 25% of Android applications available in the Play Store require tweaking in order to work on Nokia X as calls to Google services need to be replaced with ones to Microsoft replacements. Nokia promises the developers won't lose more than 2 hours to do the necessary changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we found is that the X phones use an interesting setup - there's Nokia's app store, but there are several others preinstalled too. If an app isn't available in Nokia's store, but is available in one of the others, it will show up in the search results. Just tap on it and the other app store will launch and repeat the search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Nokia Store and its friends offer a rich enough selection of apps for a platform that just launched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that apps can also be sideloaded - the process is no more complicated than putting the APK file on the phone and opening it through the file browser. This way you can add apps not available in the app stores, including a custom launcher for a more Android-like experience (keep in mind the button limitation though, there's no app switcher button).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL is the best and the brightest of the new X family but, again, it's a step up from the Asha lineup rather than something to compete with Nokia's Windows Phone offerings or even most Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL officially targets &#x20ac;110 ($150), though it's currently on pre-order at &#x20ac;130 ($180). Admittedly, there are few phones in this price segment to have a large 5" screen, especially dual-SIM ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has good viewing angles and colors, though sunlight legibility could've been better. The low resolution is what hurts it the most though - getting a 5" screen suggests you'll be reading plenty of text and small type just looks off due to the low pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For performance we'll say this - it's not KitKat-on-Snapdragon smooth, but you can use it daily without annoying hang-ups or slowdowns. The Nokia XL also enjoys a rich app library, Windows Phone had a tougher start in its early days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera was a half pleasant surprise too, the still camera can be a good 5MP shooter with some tweaking. The video camera doesn't cut it though. That said, it's miles ahead of what Asha phones could do (VGA at ~20fps at best, typically QVGA @ 15 fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few other things you'll need to tweak when you buy the Nokia XL too, including syncing your contacts either manually or via an app. Getting a microSD card is also a must, the 1GB or so left available to the user is just not enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do appreciate the Nokia HERE Drive app though - with a license for offline navigation of most of the world and a large screen with good viewing angels, the XL can easily beat a dedicated SatNav and twice as expensive Androids (don't forget to add the price of an offline navigation app when looking at other phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snuck a peek at our recent shopping guide for inspiration of what can compete with the Nokia XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's own Lumia 625 is around 30% pricier than the Nokia XL, but it has LTE, its 5MP camera can shoot 1080p video, there's 8GB of built-in storage (microSD card slot too), plus the dual-core Krait will smoke the Cortex-A5s. This one has HERE Maps too, though only for one country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.7" WVGA screen is a little smaller, but the whole device is noticeably more compact and lighter. Oh, and it has Gorilla Glass 2 to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 runs Windows Phone 8, which is catching up to Android in terms of features and apps. Also, it's the third leading smartphone platform (even if it's a distant third). The XL runs Android but without the Play Store we have to wonder whether app developers will prioritize WP8's 8% or so market share over Nokia X's current 0% share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 625</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto G was probably the first device you thought of when you heard "cheap Android". For the specs it offers, it is indeed quite cheap with a 4.5" 720p screen and quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the cheap version only has 8GB of non-expandable storage, which is a deal-breaker. Also, "cheap" in this case is still more expensive than the Nokia XL. You need to pay extra for 16GB of storage (still limiting) or if you want dual-SIM (but you can't have both).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo is the cheaper version of an affordable Samsung model, though it still costs more than the XL. It does have a quad Cortex-A7 processor with more RAM and can record 720p video. It comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM flavors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C is Sony's device in the same segment - a 5" screen and dual-SIM connectivity. It has a qHD screen (187ppi vs. 220ppi), 8MP/1080p camera and a quad-core processor over the Nokia XL. It's also thinner and lighter, despite having a bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch Scribe Easy is one of several relevant Alcatel options, but this one is right on the money. It's virtually the same price as the Nokia, has a dual-SIM option and very similar specs overall. It does have 720p video capture and a bigger, 2,500mAh battery, plus a capacitive stylus if you're into that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you can't find the Scribe Easy, the Scribe HD is also a good option - it's pricier, but with improved specs across the board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Alcatel One Touch Scribe Easy &#x2022; Alcatel One Touch Scribe HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Z5 is another option whose specs follow the Nokia XL recipe closely (down to the dual-SIM connectivity), but it adds front-facing stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid Z5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a particular subset of customers, the Nokia XL represents amazing value for money. In emerging markets with expensive data plans, people who need navigation daily will find great use in the XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thinking more globally, the Nokia XL is just the right replacement for an Asha phone - it has a bigger screen, of a higher resolution, a better camera, improved performance and plenty more apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those on a shoestring budget, it even looks like an attractive Android smartphone. The Nokia XL is certainly not for everyone, but it does find a niche spanning the gap between the last few premium (if you can call them that) feature phones and the smartphone entry-level. Nokia is taking a small gamble with the X family, but the XL could pay off with some market share and increased use of Nokia/Microsoft services - a win - win for both the companies and the consumers.</paragraph>
