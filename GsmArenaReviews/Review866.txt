		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is a trimmed-down version of last year's Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and Samsung is not exactly keeping it secret - we cannot think of a more fitting model name. If, on the other hand, you're scratching your head wondering was there anything to trim to begin with, you're not alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, Samsung found a way. They got rid of the front-facing camera, put a 2MP unit around back, and replaced the chipset. No, not a Snapdragon 800, thank you very much. In many ways though, this is the same tablet - the Android version is the same, good-ol' TouchWiz on top (no Magazine UI obviously) and the size and ergonomics are also on par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that might derail Samsung's plans is that the original Tab 3 is still available from various retailers and having undergone a few price cuts its closer to the Lite 7.0 than the new arrival would have liked. Then again, it may nudge the right people to re-think the price tag. Let's check out the full specs of the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite before we continue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, a handful of Pro series tablets we recently reviewed made the third generation of Korean tablets pale in comparison. The Lite puts them in perspective though, helping them regain some lost confidence. That's not to say the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 isn't worth your time. If you're looking for a compact and, most of all, affordable tablet - one you wouldn't worry about getting lost or damaged - this is a good a choice as any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, it's an extra browsing or reading screen in the living room, something to get your kid because you wouldn't spoil them with an iPad or a Galaxy Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 will certainly have to work hard to even get on anyone's shortlist. In the tightly packed entry-level segment, a small bump in price can often make a big difference in the level of equipment. Nook, Kindle and Nexus are by far not the only threat - affordable Android tablets are to be had from reputable brands and no-name makers alike. Let's see what's on offer here - starting with the design and build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 116.4 x 193.4 x 9.7mm, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is a little taller and wider than its predecessor, the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, but comes a tad thinner at 9.7 mm. The compact tablet is pleasingly lightweight at 310g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 isn't the most imaginative device we've come across. Samsung is keeping the slim-bezel styling for its Pro lineup and the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite is left with the practical, unexciting design choices. The usual three button layout is non-negotiable though, regardless of price range. In honesty, a hardware Home key and off-screen capacitive buttons are not as questionable at this screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't any sensors or an earpiece above the display, as ours is the W-Fi only version, with no voice call support. We mentioned already that the Tab 3 Lite does without a front facing camera. Now, that's a bit strange. If it's a tablet, be it so compact, it would've been more reasonable to get rid of the rear cam. The Tab 3 Lite has a 2MP unit at that - hardly one to be missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back lacks the soft leather-like feel but does have a nice texture to it. The back is flat but curved edges wrap around the front. The rounded sides favor grip in what's generally a pretty comfortable device to hold in one hand. The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is officially said to come in Cream White and Dark Gray but our model has a white front and turquoise or cyan rear (we've come across a robin egg blue description as well). Interestingly, this color option isn't officially confirmed by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is comfortable for one-handed operation thanks to its size and weight. You won't be able to reach the far end of the screen with just your thumb but once you've settled into a YouTube video, movie or a website single-handed support is trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've preferred slimmer bezels and the faux leather back is something we can live without. After all, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is an entry-level device, so just being portable and comfortable to hold is good enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Under the screen we find the physical home button flanked by the capacitive back and menu buttons. A double tap on the home button will prompt the task switcher while a press and hold will open up S Voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume and power buttons are placed next to each other on the tall right-hand side of the slate. Both have good press feedback the power button's position is obviously favoring landscape hold. The left side features the microSD card slot under a port cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the device has the microphone pinhole while on the top we find the microUSB port and 3.5 mm headphone jack. Ideally those would be on the bottom for when the device is lying flat on a table in front of you but we guess this layout works as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back, is not the faux-leather variety but still has a texture to it, which feels good to the touch. The 2MP flash-less camera lens and mono loudspeaker grille are in the top part of the back, the Samsung logo inscribed close below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is the lowest resolution to have on a tablet - if you don't count a number of WVGA screes by the likes of Alcatel, Dell, Huawei and other, less-known brands. 600 x 1024 will do the job for an inexpensive tablet - but only just. There definitely are sharper screens in the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite's price bracket. At 170 ppi, things look far from impressive but, taking into account that you're holding the slate at arm's length, it's not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our display test shows the 7-incher mounted on the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is one of the worse screens to have in the Galaxy Tab lineup. The blacks are good at 50% brightness but at higher levels quickly deteriorate, brightness is good but it's contrast that's a letdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 pixel arrangement</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor contrast makes the screen look washed out and viewing angles could've been better too. Add the low resolution and you have a below average display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 we're reviewing has no voice call support, so web browsing and video playback are the only routines we tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is powered by a 3600mAh battery, which sounds robust for the modest hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our web browsing test, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 managed a respectable 8 hours and 20 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In video playback, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 lasted for 9 hours, which will more than do on the commute or long flight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite turned out a portable tablet with good battery life, so that's two boxes checked for the daily commuter. The solid stand-by time is another point in favor - if you're in for the extra screen in the living room.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Latest Android 4.2.2 ticks inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 runs TouchWiz-skinned Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. The TouchWiz launcher is the same as what we saw in the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see our usual user interface video here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that because we are reviewing the Wi Fi-only version, options and settings related to calling will understandably be absent. Still, if you opt for the 3G Tab 3 Lite 7.0 versions, you'll also get the Phone app and you will be able to make calls and use cellular data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features the widgets introduced with Android 4.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect but you can switch back to the old one, or disable it altogether. If you like the ripple effect though, it's available in the Lockscreen settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets. There are no pages to the right from the default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greeting on the lockscreen can be changed - you can type something else, set a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative unlock routines as well - Face unlock, Face and voice unlock, Pattern or Password. There are voice-based wakeup commands that can just start S Voice or launch a preselected app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the notification area there are six (nine in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. To get to the additional toggles you either swipe down with two fingers or hit the top rightmost button to reveal them. A press and hold on a toggle will take you to the corresponding setting. You can rearrange and disable toggles through the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider. Sadly it lacks an Auto mode as there is no ambient light sensor on the Tab 3 Lite. You can disable this slider to have more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certain notifications can be expanded with a finger and collapsed again. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks the same as on the Tab 3 8.0. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's the a wraparound feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 homescreen, naturally, auto-rotates, enabling landscape use of the entire interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - any of the available homescreen panes can be set as default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen, giving you an overview of all panes as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can check how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice can be used to initiate or answer a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including a voice one), add a reminder, schedule an event, set or snooze an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, take a photo, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question - in other words it's an all you can eat voice assistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, has the weather forecast for your location and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is (really, living under a rock or something?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen as well and can show you information in the notification area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is pretty underpowered with a dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9 processor, built by Vivante Corporation. The chipset is a GC1000 and has its own graphics processing unit. To complete the tally the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 comes with 1 GB of RAM.

ul.jrGraphControls { padding: 0; margin-left: -10px !important; } 
  


JRGRAPH_EXPANDABLE_VERSION = true;

 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BenchmarkPi, which measures the calculative skills of the processing cores the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 scores an okay 416 which is a little faster than its predecessor the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0. Linpack gives multithreaded performance a gauge, here last year's Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 got the better score leaving the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 behind.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4, Quadrant and GeekBench 3 all give the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 a pretty low score and a bottom of the list place, although in Quadrant the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 managed to outdo the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 by a small margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivante GPU inside the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 was pretty hard to test as it was unable to run the Epic Citadel and NenaMark 2 benchmarks which left us with GFXBench's T-Rex benchmark, where the offscreen capabilities of the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 proved to result in a lowly 1.6 fps, luckily you'd be doing gaming not on 1920 x 1080 but in native 600 x 1024 so there's not much need to worry here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally some browsing benchmarks. SunSpider is JavaScript-heavy, BrowserMark is HTML 5-focused while Vellamo gives both the stress test. Our contender managed pretty low scores in all three compared to its rivals and the general list of devices we've tested, all of which means the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 won't browse as fast as its pricier rivals nor as top tier smartphones but will do the job for the price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is no benchmarking champion and its aging Cortex-A9 chipset won't set the mark for fast computing but it does the job most of time. What we did notice is lag and pretty long loading times, especially with apps like Google Play and YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's nothing drastic and deal-breaking but it stands to note that some of its rivals - like the Nexus 7 of 2012 are still pretty snappy in daily tasks, snappier than the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz phonebook is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook in the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is very straightforward. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this and you can also let the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 sync your social network contacts if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation is intuitive with the contact list on the left and one focused contact on the right. You also get a search bar and letter indicators for faster finding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, naturally, edit contacts and add quite a bit of useful information like address, emails, notes, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email - new Gmail and Hangouts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail sorts emails by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 also features a combined inbox in its standard email app. It brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a synch schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts handles the Instant Messaging department. It offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, GIF support, history sync across multiple devices, and a fresh, minimal design. It's available on iOS as well making it multi-platform.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 comes with several text input options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big screen makes for comfortable portrait typing, and we appreciate the extra row just for the numbers. Two finger typing is comfortable on the Tab 3 Lite 7.0 in portrait mode, but becomes a pain in landscape. Sadly the split-screen keyboard isn't available on the Tab 3 Lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right on the keyboard to position the cursor. The keyboard can also be made into a type of floating widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handwriting recognition is also available, but it's quite slow since there is no S-Pen support. The available keyboards are much better options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and since the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is running Android Jelly Bean, this will work even if the tablet is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. Just like in the phonebook, you can choose what kind of content should be displayed - photos and videos from the phone, Dropbox, Facebook or Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can adjust the thumbnail grid size via a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that album's stack of photos but a swipe to the right will list all albums. In this mode you can browse images in a dual-screen mode and easily select files from multiple folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share an image to any app which supports it straight from the gallery and you also get a nifty thumbnailed list of images at the bottom for faster browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a built-in editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contextual tags display labels with the location, as well as id the people in the photo and show the date. Then there's the print option, so you can print out photos without going through a computer first (but you'll need a Samsung printer).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 uses the TouchWiz music player. Equalizer presets (including a custom one) are available along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into categories (Albums, Songs, Playlists, Artists, Genres, Folders, Composers, Years, Music Square, Nearby devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Familiar, great player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is less powerful than its upper-class contemporaries the video thumbnails aren't animated in the video libary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. Dolby Mobile is available in the video player to enhance your audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Tab 3 Lite 7.0 supports Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly chapter preview is also missing from the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite - otherwise it divides videos into chapters so it's easier for users to get around in movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). The only problem was resolution, most 1080p videos didn't play, mainly due to the chipset limitations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 scored a Below Average in our loudspeaker test. The speaker on its back sounds very weak and isn't very good for ringing, pink noise or vocal sound representation. It will do for watching YouTube in a quiet environment but not much in a louder setting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is amazing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its lowly standing in the pecking order, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 put up a great performance in our audio quality test. The diminutive tablet easily matched the output of its premium siblings from the Pro family, which makes it one of the most gifted musicians around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the volume levels are only decent in both parts of our test, every single readings we got was excellent. We saw perfectly spotless output when the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 was connected to an active external amplifier and next to know degradation when headphones came into play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No frills camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Tab 3 Lite 7.0's main camera can capture stills of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels and VGA videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty simple - it has a virtual shutter button, shortcuts for exposure, effects, settings, etc. and a switch to go into video mode..</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the shortcuts available here, but most people will probably stick to the Mode selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are relatively few manual settings, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 just gives you an ISO setting, white balance and exposure compensation. You can also use color effects too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2 MP images aren't considered high quality in the phone world for close to 10 years now and as you'd expect the ones taken with the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 don't wow with detail, colors or anything, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are good for the resolution with decent detail and colors, but at 2MP that's not worth bragging about. All in all we would suggest using the camera in extreme emergency only. Then again, that's probably the way to go for all tablet cameras - good or bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for video - the VGA samples are stored in MP4 format with a bitrate north of 2500 Kbps, a slightly sturrety 23 fps framerate, single audio channel with a 60 Kbps bitrate with a sampling rate of 48 kHz. Read all of that as not impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again detail is pretty good for this resolution, but that's hardly a great achievement. There's little stutter but not to be a nuisance and colors and exposure look great too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video sample - VGA@23fps (21s, 6.74MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 has the basic connectivity features. Since we have the Wi Fi-only version, there's no GSM/3G connectivity to speak of while the Cellular model lacks LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers b/g/n, with Wi-Fi Direct. The tablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more tightly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content on nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the My Video app and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also no infrared port on the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite so you won't be able to use it as a remote for your TV.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Jelly Bean browser is running on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0. It looks much like Google Chrome and has pretty much about the same functionality sans the cross-platform sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome's interface is the same as most of the desktop browsers - a top row with all the opened tabs, and a second row with the back and forward buttons, the URL bar with a refresh button, the tab switching key and the bookmarks key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is preferred by many as the default browser because it has excellent cross-platform syncing of tabs and history and lets you pick up from your PC, tablet or smartphone to any of your other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Tab 3 Lite 7.0's organizing skills cover the basics - there is a calendar, document app, notes app and some others but if you miss anything the Google Play store is always there with cheap or even free alternatives that will get the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polaris Office document viewer and editor lets you open word files, pdf's, spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, as well as connect to various cloud services such as Box, Dropbox, and Google Docs. Creating and editing documents, sheets and presentations is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner is really powerful calendar app part of the TouchWiz UI. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating event is very easy and you can add reminders, location, people, images, repeat intervals. All events automatically sync with your Google account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled their new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0. It can sync contacts, calendar and notes and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Cloud can also hook up to Dropbox. If you do this, photos and videos from your Dropbox account will be synced with the tablet's gallery. You can have the Tab 3 Lite 7.0 sync those photos and videos only over Wi-Fi to save on data usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The once unified clock app has been divided on the Tab 3 Lite 7.0 into World Clock and Alarms. Both are pretty simple and do just what the name entails - one sets up alarms, while the other lets you pick cities with their corresponding time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has included its Smart Alarm - it starts the lowered alarm tone a couple of minutes early and gradually increases it until it's time for you to get up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator has both the numpad and the scientific shortcuts in portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Notes app is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app has an interface similar to that of the gallery, though that one is available only in landscape mode. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about two minutes to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location but that requires the slate to be 3G-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. It functions best when connected to a wireless network, offline mode won't be able to show you routes and POIs, even if you've cached the maps you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. Caching of maps is done by positioning the map and selecting Make Available Offline from the search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is trying to keep things as simple as possible but its prospects are complicated. At this point at least, shortly after the announcement. Samsung must've done the math, anticipating sufficient demand from certain markets, but we must admit it's easy to question the Lite's very place in the company's new tablet lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, it's not a bad looking tablet - in the simplest possible way - portable, friendly and with solid battery backup. And it's the cheapest of the latest generation. Oh well, it's not the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite's fault that its siblings are Pros. Unfortunately, it's got a handful of rival tablets to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we don't think the likes of the Nook, Kindle and Nexus 7 (older generation at that) are even in the same conversation. Pretty obvious, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite will be targeting markets where the above are not readily available. The Lite will be battling its way through hordes of low-cost seven-inchers by white label manufacturers and second-tier brands alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 currently costs more than its better-equipped predecessor and it's just the tip of the iceberg. The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is cheaper for both the Wi-Fi only and 3G-enabled versions, and it comes with a front-facing camera and there's an option with double the built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo IdeaTab A3000 has an optional 3G version too and costs way less than the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0. It matches the Lite in all aspects: display size and resolution, Android version, battery but adds a better camera, USB OTG and a more powerful processor at the expense of a little extra thickness and weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo IdeaTab A3000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first ASUS Nexus 7 will cost you less for the Wi-Fi only and 3G-enabled version and it brings a vastly superior screen, more powerful chipset and overall better Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Google Nexus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the ASUS MeMo Pad HD7 costs the same as the Samsung tablet but has better screen resolution, faster quad-core processor, higher-res camera and is lighter. HP has a bunch of low-cost tablets too with better specs than the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Memo Pad HD7 16 GB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 is facing an uphill battle in a crowded market where makers seem to have little choice but stretch the definition of a "budget tablet" to get even a fraction of an inch ahead of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Free on (cheap) contract looks at this point the Lite's best shot. And that's in markets where the competition isn't interested in - with users who either don't have too much choice or are choosing a reliable and recognized brand over dirt-cheap alternatives.</paragraph>
