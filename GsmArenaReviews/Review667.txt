			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei brought out several devices today, but their event was heavy on wearables. The MediaPad X2 tablet should be enough to keep fans of traditional devices happy, but with one brilliant smartwatch and two premium smart bands, it's clear how the company sees the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad X2 is a 7" tablet with LTE connectivity and an octa-core processor, courtesy of the company's in-house chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch is the first smartwatch with a sapphire screen, a perfectly round AMOLED screen. It's highly customizable with a selection of case colors and wristbands, plus 40 watch faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are two smart bands ? the TalkBand B2 and TalkBand N1. The TalkBand B2 is a Bluetooth headset that goes into a wristband to be worn on your hand and offers a number of sport tracking features. The TalkBand N1 is looks like a pair of headphones that forms a sort of pendant you wear around your neck.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei MediaPad X2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei did not bring any new phones on the MWC 2015, but it did showcase a nice hybrid between a phone and a tablet - the Huawei MediaPad X2. It's a 7" device with support for voice calls over cellular networks and LTE Cat.6 connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad X2 looks a lot like a bigger flavor of the 6" Huawei Ascend Mate7 phablet. It features a lightweight unibody aluminum shell, great 80% screen-to-body ratio and powerful new Kirin 930 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad X2 utilizes a fully laminated 7" IPS display of 1920 x 1200 pixels (that's 323ppi) and runs on Huawei's latest chip - Kirin 930. The new platform employs an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor with four cores ticking at 2.0GHz and the other four at 1.5GHz, while the GPU in charge of graphics is Mali-T628.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad X2 will be offered in a 16GB flavor with 2GB of RAM and a more premium version with 32GB storage and 3GB of RAM. This policy seems to be spreading fast among the flagship tier, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the specs of the Huawei MediaPad X2 include a 13MP rear camera, a 5MP front selfie shooter, and a 5,000 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei MediaPad X2 will be available in moonlight silver for the 16GB model and rose gold for the 32GB flavor. It is 7mm thin and weighs just 239g. Both devices are dual SIM-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took some time to play with the Huawei MediaPad X2 and we found it quite lightweight and comfy for its size. The brushed aluminum provides good grip while handling the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad X2 is light and comfortable enough to be operated and handled with just one hand. You can even use it as a mobile phone if you like, it has an earpiece above the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have been odd few years ago, but now with all those Asus Fonepads and similar devices around, we won't find it so outlandish if someone was to replace their smartphone with a 7-inch tablet with call functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei MediaPad X2 runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop, skinned with company's latest Emotion UI 3.0. The launcher is highly customizable, supports various themes, security features and enhancements, power optimizations and more. The OS feels really smooth and snappy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad X2 pricing and availability are yet to be announced.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Watch hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei unveiled a stunning smartwatch just hours after LG did the same. The Huawei Watch is actually more compact but has a bigger, sharper screen than its Urbane rival, more customization options out of the box too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch is made out of cold-forged stainless steel. The case measures 42mm in diameter - compact for a smartwatch and about average for a regular watch - and is 11.3mm thick. It's quite light as well, which may not be your thing if you prefer heavy watches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body comes in Silver, Black and Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wristbands connect to the watch's body with no gaps (the LG Watch Urbane had some air between them), which looks great. The standard wristbands include genuine leather options along with metal mesh bands and even one fabric wristband.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bands are interchangeable and Huawei had a wide selection on display, some of which were quite premium. The clasp could have been better though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company claims the watch can be worn on either hand, however the off-center crown doesn't seem to comfy if you wear it on your right hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a 1.4" AMOLED, perfectly round, with 400 x 400px resolution. It tops the LG watch in terms of sharpness, though seeing one after the other we didn't notice a groundbreaking difference. We were under high-power stage lights when handling the Watch and the screen remained perfectly legible the entire time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the Huawei Watch is the first smartwatch with a scratch-resistant sapphire glass. Some Apple Watch models will have it too, but it's strictly reserved for the high-end offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has made 40 watch faces and they look amazing, at a glance they feel like an actual analog watch. The flat geometric design of Android Wear that crops up when you use the advanced functions the illusion breaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch has a built-in heartrate monitor and will work with a custom Huawei app to track your health and fitness. The company has partnered with Jawbone and the app will support additional wearables, but you can just use Google Fit if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also 6-axis motion tracking, a barometer and a vibration motor. The watch is compatible with Android 4.3+ phones and uses Bluetooth 4.1, giving it a range of about 10m. It has a 300mAh battery, which Huawei claims is enough for 1.5-2 days of casual use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Watch will launch globally sometime around the middle of the year, the price is yet to be confirmed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei TalkBand B2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei revealed the Talkband B2, a successor to the Talkband B1 revealed at last year's MWC. The TalkBand 2 is in a different styling league in comparison and is available in black, silver and champagne. The band itself is passive, as the earpiece module separates and turns into a Bluetooth headset for when you need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charging port is also on the Talkband B2 hands-free module, which makes it a bit inconvenient for when you need to charge it. By Huawei's estimations, the smartband can last 5 days, while the Bluetooth headset is good for 6 hours of talk time. Charging time takes 1.5 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the front of the TalkBand B2 is a 0.73" PMOLED touch screen, which is quite bright, but don't expect wonders from it. It's good enough for when you need to view your pedometer data. The band can also measure calorie intake, sleep duration and has stopwatch functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The band is compatible with Android 4.0+ and iOS 7.0+, which is good enough coverage for now. A Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS apps will be more than welcome, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the band measures 62mm x 20.6mm x 11mm and measures 16.8 grams, while the earpiece is just 9.4 grams. The TalkBand B2 will retail for &#x20ac;179 with the choice of black, white and brown straps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei TalkBand N1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In addition to the smartband, Huawei also debuted the TalkBand N1 Bluetooth headphones. The headset is oriented towards fitness users and is water and sweat resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting features of the headphones is that they'll give you voice notifications for the number of steps you've taken and how much left you have towards your set goal. At 18 grams, the TalkBand N1 is very lightweight and can stay 108 hours in stand-by mode, lasts 4.5 hours of talk time and plays music for 7 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built-in storage is 4GB, which equals to 1000 songs by Huawei's estimations. It connects to your phone over Bluetooth 3.0 and supports remote control of songs via an additional App. Supported music formats include MP3, WMA, FLAC, WAV, APE and ACC. Frequency range is 20Hz - 20kHz and there's a built-in APTX for better sound quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available in champagne, silver and pink, the TalkBand N1 will likely retail between &#x20ac;100-200, but exact pricing information isn't available yet.</paragraph>
