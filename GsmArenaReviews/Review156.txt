			<paragraph>It's not everyday that you see a BlackBerry review on our homepage but it's not like RIM routinely churn out devices like the Storm either. Messaging is still the legendary name but? well? touchscreen is the game. Keeping the business appeal of its siblings, the 9500 Storm sure stands out in the Berry crowd. But it also tries to set itself apart from the other touchscreens by promising a whole new touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Canadian manufacturer RIM is walking an unbeaten path by adding unique clickability to the fluid precision of the capacitive touchscreen technology. The award-winning SurePress screen may not be everyone's cup of coffee but we're not talking teacup either, just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this isn't one of those all-about-email BlackBerry reviews where the 9500 Storm gets only compared to its own kind, for the lack of meaningful competition. We are more than confident that the Storm does its BlackBerry thing just fine, so instead of focusing on it we'll try to give a different view of the device. Our objective is to see how it fares against all those other "regular" touchscreens that have the crowd's attention: Apples, Renoirs, Omnias, Diamonds and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, our approach may seem like comparing apples to oranges but only at first sight. The first thing about the Storm 9500 is the attempt to reach beyond the core group of diehard BlackBerry users. We're talking stealing some market here, so if Blackberry are playing to win, they should well be ready to take some hard beating too. First-rate email is nice and all, but the Storm will only be as good as its user interface and multimedia. For the rest (which means WLAN too) there's Curve and Bold.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Some treats in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Storm 9500 comes in a retail package worthy of its price tag and high standing. Besides the phone itself the nice looking box holds an 8GB microSD card, microUSB cable and a DC charger that can take both American and European voltage. All you have to do is slide in the appropriate plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storm also comes with a nice leather carrying pouch and a cloth for polishing its shiny face. A handsfree is also included but it's one-piece, so alternative earphones on the same remote is not an option. Finally, you get a CD with some arguably useful PC software and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Storm 9500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 112.5 x 62.2 x 14 mm and 155 g of weight the BlackBerry Storm 9500 is certainly a heavy bloke. It is pretty heavier than most of its competitors, including the iPhone 3G which is no featherweight itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the substantial weight does work in favor of the Storm 9500 for the distinct upmarket feel it lends. The Storm sure isn't the most pocketable touchscreen, but the quality build and reliability pay off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't get tired of saying that you just cannot be too creative designing a touch-operated handset. Indeed the BlackBerry Storm 9500 is quite similar to most other touchscreen handsets out there but for the few extra pounds around the waist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra few millimeters of thickness give the lovable chubby a rather distinct personality, resulting in a profile pretty different to, say, LG KC910 Renoir. The glossy plastic on the face and the metallic rear cover do look nice but the front gets covered in smudges and loses much of its appeal in almost no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite understandably the most of the Storm's front panel is taken by the 3.25" touchscreen display. The most important feature of the handset has its reserved spot a while later in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements of interest at the front are the call and end keys, the menu and back key as well as the earpiece and the loudspeaker grill at the top. There is also a LED status indicator at the top. The keys are large and tactile, and generally render no obstacles to usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the BlackBerry Storm 9500 hosts the microUSB port that is also used for charging, as well as one of the convenience keys. By default its functionality is set to starting the voice dialing but you can change that if you prefer otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other convenience key is on the right of the handset, below the volume keys and the 3.5mm standard audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the BlackBerry Storm 9500 hides two keys - one for locking the display and the other for muting the phone. At first sight you might miss those two controls as the surface looks smooth and save for the two small icons there is no way you can tell there are keys underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole is at the bottom, being the only element of interest there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The backside is where the 3.2 megapixel camera lens is located. A LED flash is built-in but, as usual, it fails to make a big difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other noteworthy element at the back is the loudspeaker. Located just below the nice metallic battery cover it hides under a pretty robust - in mobile phone terms - grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover itself is removed by squeezing the two release latches. Underneath lays the memory card slot, which luckily is hot-swappable. You will have to remove the cover every time you want to replace it but at least you won't need to turn the phone on and off. And you have our word here - powering the BlackBerry Storm up does take bloody ages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another good news is that the Storm can easily handle 16GB microSD cards which is the largest capacity currently available on the market. Furthermore the handset managed to scan the contents of a 16GB card quicker in a few seconds, which is just amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Li-Ion battery itself is pretty promising with a capacity of 1400 mAh. It is enough to get you through two days of hardly giving the phone a break or four days of mild usage and that's a really good achievement however you look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have no reason whatsoever to complain about the build quality of the Storm 9500. All the parts seem durable and sturdy enough, and the phone is built to last, keeping looks intact in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already told you, the BlackBerry Storm 9500 is a pleasure to handle never mind its hefty size and weight. It fills your palm much more than a Samsung M8800 Pixon or an LG KC910 Renoir and the solid feel is quite similar to what you get from the overweight Nokia Arte handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display rocks? no, really<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this certainly is the most interesting part of the BlackBerry Storm 9500. The display of the handset is so strikingly different from any other touchscreen that the learning curve for proper handling is likely to be quite steep at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole display of BlackBerry Storm 9500 is one giant button, which you press to confirm your selection. In addition, the display uses the capacitive technology for a very smooth and responsive touch action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This gives you the chance to make a selection without confirming it and only press the display when you are sure the item is the one you want. In some parts of the user interface this proves to be a very welcome benefit, reducing your mistakes to the minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might argue that this two-step selection slows you down but on most occasions they will be wrong. There are of course some cases where having to press this giant button takes its toll but those are not that frequent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A certain issue of the display is that it's not seated firmly in place like it doesn't fit its frame (quite strange, we know) and it tangibly slips sideways leaving large crevices, which will inevitable start to fill up with dirt and dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While this side-sliding thing was no real obstacle to usability at this stage, the side wobble gives a somewhat cheap feel that you wouldn't expect of a handset in this price range. They simply could have cut the frame to match the screen dimensions more precisely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite that flaw, the guys over at RIM have put some extra effort in balancing the feedback of the screen and the regular keys making it quite consistent and thus switching seamlessly between both controls is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the display is also really impressive with nice vibrant colors, good brightness and contrast. The legibility under direct sunlight is also faultless making up for a very impressive unit overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is really little to complain about the display of the BlackBerry Storm 9500. Right on the contrary - it manages to provide users with a very different touchscreen experience, which in this increasingly competitive market is anything but easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we can see how some people may smell a major contradiction here: why add the burden of press to an already fluent and responsive capacitive touchscreen. Here's what we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if the novelty of the system only boils down to a self assertion stunt, the SurePress implementation is still secure and fluent enough to impress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can look at it this way: the Berry has the iPhone screen (plus some extra pixels on top for pure 4:3 aspect ratio) and the click thing is an extra bonus in certain scenarios and almost never a liability. Typing (once you get the hang of it) on the virtual QWERTY keypad is as close to physical as we've seen. Incidental hitting of links in the browser is completely ruled out - touch won't do, a gentle press is needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is a critical aspect of every touchscreen device. The BlackBerry Storm 9500 runs on a touch-optimized version of the BlackBerry OS, which is pretty attractive at first sight. The icons are nicely drawn and finger optimized and there are some pretty decent transitions here and there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, once you dig deeper you come across some pretty late nineties-looking text only submenus. Those are not too much of an issue but still we cannot help noting that it wouldn't have been such an effort to perk them up a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to any of the other touch UIs on the market (TouchWiz, Apple's portable OS X, the upcoming S-class and even the S60 5th edition) those parts of the menu look well dated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, it isn't too rare for a menu item or a setting to be buried too deep in the menu making it a real problem for novice users to locate. For example the file manager is in the media submenus, which surely isn't the first place to look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, none of the items in the Storm 9500 user interface is so out of place that you wouldn't get used to. After a few days every user will probably be well familiar with the layout. But that doesn't really solve the problem with the too basic looks of the deeper UI levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the interface is pretty consistent with the specific display action, which is put to the best use on most occasions. Touching an item usually brings its whole name to the top of the screen while pressing the screen down confirms your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is also pretty well organized with 8 large shortcut buttons placed at the bottom and all status icons at the top. The clock and the profiles can also be accessed straight from here, as well as two other features that you choose to assign to the convenience keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu gets launched via the menu key or - that's nice - by flipping the phone landscape. This means that unlike virtually any other part of the BlackBerry Storm interface the homescreen cannot appear in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other menus the changing of modes is done by flipping the phone to its side, thanks to the built-in (and seemingly very precise) accelerometer. However, the actual screen rotation is a bit slower than the best examples on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of the BlackBerry Storm 9500 is quite different from some of its competitors. The Apple iPhone fans are used to seeing all the options available in any moment on the screen and pressing the desired one. With the Storm you have a good number of the options only revealed when you press the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That won't be a problem for experienced Crackberries but if you convert form soft-key based navigation you might find it strange that a touchscreen mobile still requires massive use of the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that you will have to spend a bit longer studying the available options if you are a first time user. On the positive side, it enabled RIM to add more options on some of the screens, without the need to oversimplify them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are able to use any of the built-in keypads or the QWERTY keyboard in almost every menu and submenu (it is available everywhere where typing is needed in any case). We will come back to the text input a while later but for now we are just going to say that this is one of the most impressive parts of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cardinal sin though of the BlackBerry Storm 9500 UI is the fact that it tends to lag now and then. It's not too bad to make operating it impossible but it gets on your nerves at times. And in the touchscreen world lagging is a curse, big time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparing the Storm interface to the other offerings on the market we have to admit that RIM's multimedia flagship simply doesn't cut it. It has some potential and the new approach to touchscreen sure works in its favor but at this stage it has neither the snappiness nor the eye candy of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Precision is important but usually it is not what a multimedia handset is all about. And when we are talking touchscreen and multimedia it's mostly about the eye-candy, responsivness and features. The BlackBerry Storm fails to truly excel in any of those at this point.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spartan phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is one part of the interface of the BlackBerry Storm 9500 that won't get a wow out of users. Looks are rather basic reminding us of older Windows Mobile versions but the virtually unlimited capacity and good organization make it a pretty decent performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically in one of those black and white lists that we warned you about. You can search a contact by gradually typing the desired name like on almost any other phone you can think of but this time you get a choice of the three different keyboard layouts that the Storm offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you a vast number of fields which are organized in several sub-groups. You can also replicate some of the fields (those that you are going to need to anyway) as many times as you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is much better looking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Getting some eyesores from the phonebook we went over to inspecting the Storm telephony and we were in for a nice treat this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm 9500 in-call screen offers four large and easy to press buttons plus five shortcuts to features you are most likely to need during a call. Those include notes, calendar, contacts, dial pad and home screen. Well that last one might not be what you need during a call but it's the quickest way to an application that is not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers good in-call voice quality and we didn't experience any interference at all. Some user reports suggest a faulty antenna on the Storm resulting in reception issues at times but this may be a unit-specific problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also performed our traditional loudspeaker test on the BlackBerry Storm 9500. We weren't overwhelmed but the Storm still snatched a good score, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging the BlackBerry way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm 9500 can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. It also has the BlackBerry instant messenger preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storm has a fairly simple and easy to use organization of the messaging department and all messages are composed through a common editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about time we discussed the text input methods available on the Storm in more detail. The handset offers a choice of three keyboards and we did find them all pretty pleasing. In fact the landscape virtual QWERTY keyboard is almost as good as a regular hardware keyboard and that is an achievement we never thought possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start though with the regular multitap keypad. There is little to tell you about it, save for the fact that the predictive writing works much better with the touchscreen because you can simply select the word you want to write from the possible options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old BlackBerry SureType keypad is already making its way on several other platforms and that's for a very good reason. It's easy to type on and if you master the AutoText (that's the BlackBerry T9 alternative) you might be a match for the QWERTY typers at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course users are free to choose whether the SureType or the multitap keypad should appear by default in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to the real deal - the landscape QWERTY keyboard. It takes slightly more than half the screen and comes in a four-row layout. Keys are large enough and with the display sinking on every press you can really hit a quick typing tempo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feedback provided is both visual (blue halo appears when a key is touched) and physical and that produces excellent results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad part is that the blue halos aren't as easy to see as the pop-ups on the iPhone QWERTY thumboard but for people that don't have extremely large fingers they will do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far so good with the BlackBerry messaging department - the handset is behaving perfectly when it comes to text entry. Now the bad news: out of the box you can only set up BlackBerry Internet Service email accounts on the Storm. This means that purchasing the handset without a proper Blackberry service plan will give a just plain email-less device and globally there are quite a lot of carriers that do not support BIS yet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few cosmetic changes here and there and touch-optimization is all that sets the Storm 9500 apart from its mortal BlackBerry siblings. Duly conservative looks and decent functionality is about what you'd expect of such a device. The business background of the Storm shines through but actually the all-about-music Nokia 5800 XpressMusic isn't much too far ahead and that should count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Storm sorts the music library automatically by artist, album and genre and you can search your tracks by gradual typing. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by activating one of the equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or through the main menu. In any case, some kind of desktop shortcut would have been appreciated but unfortunately they chose to leave it out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unexpectedly good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now here is one that got us by surprise. The BlackBerry Storm 9500 has remarkable audio quality, performing well in every aspect of our test. It easily ranks among the best on the market in terms of audio output and this isn't what we really expected from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone flaunts really good frequency response keeping on perfect track for most of its range. The rest of the readings are also excellent with great Noise level and dynamic range and distortions kept well within standards. The stereo crosstalk reading is also remarkable. All in all, you will be enjoying some great sound with BlackBerry Storm 9500 and that's a definite plus for any multimedia device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry 9500 Storm matches Apple iPod Touch 2G's frequency response almost perfectly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is crippled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Watching videos on the BlackBerry Storm 9500 is OK too. The video player works in fullscreen mode and you can opt for portrait or landscape view. A touch on the display makes the virtual buttons appear so you can control the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is lack of proper DivX and XviD support meaning you will have to convert your videos to MPEG-4 or WMV for them to play properly on the Storm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery of the Storm is hardly spectacular, being simply a touch-optimized version of what its predecessors have. Not that it's unsightly or functionally crippled - in fact it is doing pretty well overall with the 100% zoom shortcut earning our appreciation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers finger gestures, meaning that you can browse pictures by sweeping your finger across the screen. You can also zoom in on a photo by pressing the screen and sweeping your finger. Opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer. All you need to do to switch modes is to flip the phone sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos can also be zoomed in on to see more detail but the screen resolution makes sure you won't need it as much as usual. We are particularly happy with the zoom to actual size shortcut that exists on the BlackBerry devices. This gives you a quick and easy way to review photos in the finest detail possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is decently fast but the zooming is on the slow side. It takes about a second for each zoom step even when dealing with 3 megapixel photos, let alone higher-res ones. At least the panning is OK.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera not up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Storm 9500 is equipped with a 3.15 MP autofocus camera and a LED flash. However the imaging capabilities of the device are pretty limited with usability, image quality and functionality all below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The horrendous camera interface of the Storm is an indication that RIM got most things terribly wrong in this department. There is a status bar appearing at all times hiding a good portion of what actually ends up in the picture. This means that proper framing is a grave challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, the UI itself is pretty uncomfortable to work with as there are no shortcuts on the screen meaning that you have to go in the menu to change the settings. Not that there are too many settings you can apply, as those are quite limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glimmer of hope here is image-geotagging, which allows you to automatically record your location in the images' EXIF data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few other offered settings are: white balance, color effects and image stabilization. There is also the obligatory picture size and quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What bothers us even more than the interface is the picture quality of the BlackBerry Storm 9500. It is well below the average performance in the 3MP league. The amount of resolved detail falls seriously short of impressive. Probably part of the explanation is the extremely aggressive noise reduction applied, which eradicates all fine detail and gives the photos a distinct oil-painting look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has a problem with corner softness, with images lacking any sharpness at all near the edges. Contrast and dynamic range are also below par, though the colors are relatively precise. Generally we can hardly think of something good to say about the Storm camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the sample photos so you can see what we are talking about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the camera is one of the most disappointing parts of the BlackBerry Storm (with the video playback restrictions being a close second). If taking photos with your mobile phone is your thing you should definitely look elsewhere - you could get a real imaging touchscreen machine like the LG KC910 Renoir or the Samsung M8800 Pixon for less money. However if you only take an occasional shot every now and then and don't bother downloading them to a PC you might get to live with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA videos, no thanks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording brings yet another disspointment. The mighty Storm goes only as high as QVGA@30fps. And no matter what the guys over at Sony Ericsson are trying to convince you - this is not enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in 3GP format and can have a color effect applied. The LED flash can also be set to on to work as a video light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: No Wi-Fi is a bummer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually very well-heeled in terms of connectivity. Well this just goes to show that the BlackBerry Storm is all set to hit you when you least expect it. Business is all about data transfers and stuff and while we perfectly acknowledge the carriers' agenda we cannot figure out why is Wi-Fi left out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, pleasing the carriers was obviously more important than pleasing the end user, so RIM decided to go without one of the main features in the Storm. So here is a situation for them - quite a lot of business users travel for work. Why should they be forced to pay roaming data traffic when Wi-Fi would have been so much cheaper?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another one: the Storm 9500 only supports HSDPA 2100 MHz, which means that every EMEA citizen who travels across the pond will be stuck with EDGE. Now how is that for the company flagship?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm has a standard microUSB port and it?s used for connecting it to a computer and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the mobile phone including your iTunes collection of ripped and purchased music. You can even use the Storm as a tethered modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth v2.0 connectivity is also on board and the latter naturally also sports A2DP. It also has a microSD memory card slot (up to 16GB), which can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates. Blackberry have included a 8GB one for free in the package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is quite nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of BlackBerry Storm is a whole lot better than its connectivity set. Nicely touch-optimized, it takes the otherwise good BlackBerry application to a whole new level. The extraordinary touchscreen really makes a difference here, making sure you will never again hit a link by mistake. Now, if only they'd added Flash support all would've been just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning is the done by sweep gestures, and zoom is controlled by tapping on the screen. You can also zoom using the shortcut keys appearing on the screen in non-fullscreen mode or via the relevant menu. However that last option is hardly comfortable so we doubt anyone will use it too often. When you zoom in by tapping on a desired column the text does automatically center onscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed on a desktop PC. The high resolution is also a welcome bonus here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen. In all fairness, we did have a few instances of web pages not getting properly rendered but those were too rare to be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the web browser has no Flash support, meaning flash video websites like YouTube are a no-go for the Storm owners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the Storm web browser is quite comfortable to work with, even though a few more gestures implemented might have improved it even more. The lack of Flash is the big problem with it but the general experience still deserves a very positive mark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is just great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is one of the best parts of the Storm. It has a good set of applications and although some of them are not quite some lookers, their usability is on a very decent level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but unluckily the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Furthermore, document editing is also supported unlike most competing phones. Unfortunately, there is no PDF viewer preinstalled so potential users will have to get one themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter as well as voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set only one alarm which doesn't get standing ovation. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the tone, snooze interval and the volume as well as the vibration intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen. The display then automatically lights up when you lift the phone thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gaming: not the Storm element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Frankly we didn't expect to see much gaming spirit in the BlackBerry Storm 9500 and as it turned out we were right. Our unit only came with two preinstalled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first was a version of the all too popular Bricks game, adapted for touch control. While you might need some time getting used to operating your pad this way, once you do so it is hardly too different from the other similar titles we have tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other game is the Word Mole, where you have to compose words with the letters given on the board. Various bonuses and bonus levels are also at hand.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>BlackBerry Storm 9500 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps, which supposedly come preinstalled (not on our unit though). Our American friends can also enjoy the Verizon Navigator, which is quite more functional and you can also get the free Google Maps if data traffic doesn't bother you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps provides basic map functionality plus voice-guided navigation. You can enter addresses straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Maps also allow you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At this point we're expected to pass the final verdict and we are afraid it is not the one we would have liked it to be. The BlackBerry Storm isn't really likely to achieve that sweeping convergence success. Quite unfortunately for the unique touchscreen, the rest of the device's features spell doom for the whole TouchBerry project.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Storm fails to outgrow the company tradition and even if the exterior screams multimedia, the conservative business nature of BlackBerry shines through. It's almost like the guys at RIM are saying new members aren't welcome to the club, which we thought was the very idea of the Storm. And the existing members are almost sure to go for the Bold instead so the Storm pretty much finds itself in the middle of nowhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of third party applications available can also be decisive for the Storm's ambitions. A device that gets upgraded is much more valuable than the what-you-see-is-what-you-get variety. While there certainly are some 3rd party applications that you can get for your Storm right now, their number is generally less than that of competing smartphones or even than those for other BlackBerries. We really hope that the upcoming BlackBerry App World would change things for the better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally the Storm feels a stranger within its own family without being fit enough to survive the fierce competition outside of it. Obviously no company can afford to stay out of the touchscreen race and RIM are well aware of that. They even took the effort to differentiate their product with the unique SurePress system. The thing however is that the Storm remains a peculiar touch-enabled BlackBerry - with all the strengths this entails - but fails to stand up to the touchscreen standard-setters.</paragraph>
