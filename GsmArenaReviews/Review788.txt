			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Freshly announced for Verizon in the United States, HTC One (M8) for Windows is a welcome return to the Windows Phone platform for the Taiwanese manufacturer. The twin brother of One (M8) with Android arrives two long years after HTC 8X made its debut as a Windows Phone 8 flagship device (last year's 8XT for Sprint was way too low key to count).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One (M8) for Windows has all the makings of a smartphone flagship. This should hardly catch anyone by surprise - as the Windows Phone 8.1 sibling of one of the best Android smartphones money can buy, the newcomer surely doesn't skimp on specs and features. As usual, here goes the full list.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One (M8) for Windows at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case the specs of HTC One (M8) for Windows look a tad familiar to you, don't be surprised. When we mentioned earlier that the device is a twin to One (M8) with Android, we meant it literally. With One (M8) for Windows, HTC simply swapped the Sense-d Android KitKat we know and like for the latest Windows Phone 8.1.1 build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One (M8) for Windows might be toting the Windows Phone tiled UI, yet it still offers the signature Sense UI apps, including BlinkFeed and HTC Camera. Even the HTC Sense wallpapers have made it over from Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has deliberately kept One (M8) for Windows identical to the Android version. The latter has fared well with consumers and even helped get the manufacturer back in the black. The Windows Phone 8.1-booting model will also benefit from an extensive and classy marketing campaign, which has been in place over the past several months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are you ready for a Windows Phone 8.1-flavored déj? vu? Read on to check out our HTC One (M8) for Windows hands-on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One (M8) for Windows hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Save for the small Windows Phone sign under the HTC logo on the back, HTC One (M8) for Windows is a carbon copy of the Android version. As a matter of fact, you can easily mistake the two devices when looking even at their lockscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a twin to one of the best looking Android smartphones at the moment bodes well for the newly announced smartphone. Close to six months after we got to see the M8 with Android for the first time, the handset is still one of the best-looking pieces of hardware out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must admit that the Window Phone 8.1 user interface looks right at home on the gorgeous 5" 1080p display of the device. Design pundits might even argue that the tiled UI is an even better fit for the metal handset than competing Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the HTC Dot View case is also compatible with the M8 for Windows and features similar functionality. Cortana can actually operate while the case is closed and will output information on the case itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite its highly familiar design, HTC One (M8) for Windows is set to be a highly capable alternative to Nokia's high-end Windows Phone lineup. Low camera pixel count aside, the smartphone is better than its rivals from Microsoft in terms of both looks and hardware.</paragraph>
