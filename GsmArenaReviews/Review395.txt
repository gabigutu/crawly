			<paragraph>Nokia N72 bar-shaped phone is another Nokia smartphone but differs from the latest additions on the shelves of the Nokia smartphones as it runs on Symbian 8.1 OS with 2.8 edition user interface. This transitional system has to offer features from both previous Nokia Symbian smartphones and some of the characteristics of the 3rd edition UI.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Glossy and shiny<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 fascinates with its truly genuine design and construction conception. This first impression, however, is not always positive; many people find the phone rather repulsive and not at all attractive. May be this is the phone that has earned the most controversial user opinions. Even our team was divided in two when it comes to the Nokia N72 design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black bar with silver linings shines with glamour but can be hardly considered a classy phone when looked at first sight. Basically, it shines "cheaply". One very interesting moment in its design is the camera lens' cover on its back as it reminds the cover of Sony Ericsson K800. This one is much bigger, of course, and its construction is much worse than the one in the 3.2 megapixel phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 definitely isn't a small phone. It is big and heavy, but quite ok for a smartphone. As a matter of fact, it is one of the smalles in the N-series. It feels solid and stable. The small buttons of the keypad add a delicate touch in the design that surely enriches the style factor of N72. A bad thing about the looks of the phone is that it attracts fingerprints as hell. There is hardly any part of it that can remain clear of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N70 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even the "cheap" shine and the fingerprint magnet are not enough to make the phone a bad choice. Well, it took some time to get used to its weirdness but in the end it becomes a regular part of your every day equipment. You will get fond of it sooner than you expect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plastic but yet solid, could that be?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 has a pretty solid construction, even more considering the plastic that the phone is made of. The camera lens' cover is not that stable, however. It is much too loose, in our opinion. It slides downwards, uncovering the lens of the 2 megapixel camera. This cover is pretty attractive at first sight but when you use the phone for some time it may become the only thing you hate about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 front panel is very interesting as it is made of black plastic with silver lines striking through it. The silver lines are forming interesting ornaments and in their bottom, keypad zone, it shelters four buttons; the Menu, Pencil (on the left side), Music and correction C button (on the right side). The front panel also houses the 176 x 208 pixels resolution TFT display, which is capable of displaying up to 256K colors. Its quality is not among the best ones even more after we've tested Nokia phones from the 3rd edition of S60 user interface, which are supplied with great displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N72 front view ? the average display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone is pretty bare but cannot be consider in any case boring. The camera lens' cover makes up for the simplicity of the phone's back. On the top there is a NOKIA sign in white color, just above the camera lens' cover. This controversial part of the phone is made of shiny black plastic with grey ornaments on it. It really does look interesting. Beneath it is the camera lens and a flash diode next to it. In the very bottom is the battery cover loose button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N72 back view ? camera lens' cover slid down ? the camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you remove the battery cover (which by the way is pretty easy) you will see the BL-5C Li-Ion 970 mAh battery which should last up to 260 hours in stand-by mode and up to 3 hours and 35 minutes of talk time, Unfortunately, we couldn't test the phone's battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery is the SIM card bed. The SIM card can be removed quite easily and this is not an issue in this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Battery cover off ? SIM card bed ? Nokia N72 under the cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone is completely empty. It contains nothing. The right side, however, shelters the camera release button and the memory card slot. An unusual solution is the positioning of the camera release button as the phone cannot be used horizontally to take pictures. The low position of the button makes it perfect for such shooting mode. The memory card slot can take cards of the Reduced size Dual Voltage Multimedia Card (RS-DV-MMC) type. During our testing period we had a 128 MB one which should be included in the retail package. Nokia Stereo Headset HS-31, Connectivity Cable CA-53, wrist strap and cleaning cloth can also be found in the box. This, however, is market dependant.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The top side of Nokia N72 has only the Switch On/Off/Profiles button. It is rather small but still functional. You can press it easily with the soft part of your thumb. On the bottom side of N72 are located the Nokia Pop-port and the charger port. The charger type used is the new, slim one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's strange, but it's true<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the phone looks quite frustrating at first sight. The silver lines that contain four of the functional keys create the impression of a button chaos. This, however, is just a momentary impression. When you get used to the phone you will even find out that this positioning of the keys is very useful and comfortable. The two soft keys and the green and red receiver buttons surrounding the navigation D-pad are a common idea. The numeric keys below them are positioned well and the spacing between them is enough for you to distinguish them easily. The buttons are almost flat but this is not a problem when trying to reach the desired button in the dark or in your pocket. The backlighting of the keypad is perfect; it glows in soft light evenly under every button.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia N72 display looks really poor when compared to the latest displays of the 3rd edition S60 user interface Symbian Nokia phones. The TFT technology with 256K colors and 176 x 208 pixels resolution is not so bad but is far from the best. The size of the display deserves a compliment as it is 2.1" in diagonal. The picture is vivid and sharp but most of the graphics lack precision in the small details. The backlighting of the display works pretty well. However, the display is almost illegible in direct sunlight. There is still much to be done in this matter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2.8 &amp; 8.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 runs on Symbian 8.1 with 2.8th edition of the Series 60 user interface. This transitional edition is between the 2.5th and 3rd editions of the UI. It has features from both of them and can be considered as the last rehearsal before the 3rd edition. The greatest thing about the phone using an older version of the OS is that there are tons of available applications whereas the latest Symbian 9.1 S60 UI 3rd edition smartphones lack wide third-party software availability. The active stand-by display features five icons of the most used applications on the top row and other information such as calendar entries, current played music, messages, missed calls, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Active stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above all this are the network signal bar, the clock (digital or analog), carrier name, date and battery strength bar. The wallpaper is user configurable, of course, as well as the two functions assigned to the two soft keys. The main menu can be organized as a grid of 3 x 3 items or as a list. Some of the submenus are in list view with icons, some without icons and there even some in grid view. The phone has three preinstalled themes which change the wallpapers and the color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Nokia theme ? Smoke theme ? Coral theme ? themes submenu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 displays the date and time and the current missed calls and received messages when inactive. The Switch On/Off/Profiles button brings up a menu in which you can change the current ringing profile, switch off the phone, remove the memory card or switch off the phone features of N72 (flight mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Switch On/Off/Profiles menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal memory of the phone is 20 MB and is shared between the different applications. There is also a 128 MB RS-DV-MMC card included in the package. The phone doesn't seem to have any difficulties in reading the memory card and the overall speed is great. The menu speed is very good and the only lags are when trying to access the camera application and when switching on another application when having some opened already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Go To menu in the phone which operates as a second main menu. It can be fully customized and can be assigned to one of the soft keys. The Go To wallpaper and contents can be changed according to the user's preference. Also, it can be organized as a matrix grid of 4 x 5 items and as a list with icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Go To menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different ringing profiles can be accessed by the button on the top of the phone or by the menu. If you wish to personalize them you must go through the menu. There are various personalization options such as ringing tone, volume, vibration, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Profiles</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Another Symbian phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 phonebook is a regular Symbian one. It has tons of field to assign to a contact and the can be organized by First or Last name. It can be searched by gradually writing the initial letters of the desired contact's name. The phonebook supports groups but they cannot be used as a call filter. N72 also supports Speaker Independent Voice dialing which means that you can pronounce the name of the contact you wish to call and the phone will try and search it for you without you having to record your voice beforehand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You have a call<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Network reception and signal strength are great. The sound during calls is very good too. This, of course, is natural these days as most of the phones offer perfect call capabilities. There is no place for such mistakes as bad network reception or poor microphone and speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calls log in Nokia N72 strongly resembles the logs in other Nokia Symbian phones. As a matter of fact, it is the same. It can contain up to 10 records in every one of the categories, which are Missed, Received and Dialed numbers. There is also a Recent calls tab which shows the last call events, including missed, dialed and received calls. Every record contains information about the call duration and there is a counter which tells you of the overall calls duration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Log menu ? Recent calls ? Call duration</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Package data counter which records the data transfers. When you have a missed call, there is a pop-up window on the main screen which reminds you. If you ignore it, there will be a small sign in top right corner which indicates that you still haven't checked out whose call you have missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Package data counter ? I have missed a call ? Dexter was calling me</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a great feature in the phone which allows you to send a predefined text message to a caller if you wish not just to reject his call but explain to him why you cannot talk right now. It is well known from the Series 40 models but not many people are using it. Our team considers this option as a great one because it allows you to inform the other party of your current unavailability without rudely rejecting it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Dexter is calling me ? Should I answer him or may be send him a message?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS and email factory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 messaging menu sure looks a lot similar to every other Symbian messaging menu. It contain the Inbox of all messages except emails, the Drafts, the email inboxes (if any), Reports folder, My Folders, Outbox and Sent. The message editor is the usual one. It can fit up to six lines en bloc and show the character count and the amount of messages that will be sent in the top left corner. Of course, there is T9 dictionary to assist you in the writing process. When reading a message there are six lines too. The email client is the standard Symbian one too. It works with SMTP and POP protocols and can handle attachments seamlessly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music makes the people come together<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player in Nokia N72 is called Music. It has some good features as it supports playlists but lacks even the most primitive equalizer. It can play in background and the current song is displayed on the active stand-by display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Gallery ? the music player in Nokia N72 ? Options ? Active stand-by display ? Music menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 has a FM radio but it can be accessed only if you have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna. There is the Visual Radio application which can display broadcasted picture or video from the radio station (if supported).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A camera we already know<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 has a 2 megapixel camera of a good quality. The lens protecting cover on the back of the phone automatically activates the camera application when slid open. This, however, is not the best solution as it opens unintendedly pretty often. The capture button is situated for horizontal shooting mode but the camera has vertical mode only. This is a bit confusing and the soft key assigned for taking a picture is much better way to capture the picture.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No 3G or IrDA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 has GPRS and EDGE connectivity features, both Class 10. It is also a tri-band GSM phone but has no 3G networks support. For the short distance transfers, the phone supports Bluetooth but lacks Infrared port and thus cannot communicate with older devices, which lack Bluetooth. The phone also has USB 2.0 support, with a Nokia data cable, of course.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An old browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two Internet browsers in Nokia N72. One of them is the old browser, used in previous Symbian Nokia phones. It opens HTML pages but lacks sophisticated features included in the new browser in 3rd edition S60 phones. Smaller and simpler pages are opened easily but complex pages are chaotically reordered and are mostly difficult to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Bookmarks of the Internet browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other browser we found on the phone was the Opera browser which handles web pages slightly better then the one mentioned above. This is the full scale Opera for Symban, not the Opera mini Java browser. It has some nice features too, but cannot be compared to the new Symbian browser in terms of functionality. We cannot be sure that the browser will come with the phone as our device was a test version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Opera browser</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>In desperate need of order<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office menu of the phone contains the following applications: Recorder, Converter, To-do, Calculator, Notes, Security, Quicksheet, Quickword, Quickpoint, Adobe Reader, HP Info Print. The Recorder application is the common voice recorder with 1 minute recording limit, which is quite strange but is usual for the Nokia Symbian phones. The Converter can convert different units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Office menu ? Voice recorder ? Converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-do application is for creating short notes with assignment which have to be done in short period. The Calculator is a simple one and lacks complicated features. The Notes application is for creating text notes and can be easily synchronized with PC which is very useful for transferring large text files to your phone. The Security application is a Mobile version of the famous F-Secure anti-virus program.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     To-do ? Calculator ? Notes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quicksheet, Quickword and Quickpoint applications allow the user to open Office documents as Excel, Word and Powerpoint files. All applications have few features and lack essential ones, the main of which is that they cannot edit the documents. The Adobe reader opens PDF files and is very useful. The HP Info Print application is very handy if you wish to print a part of your phone's data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Quicksheet two possible views ? Quicksheet properties ? Quickword ? options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Adobe Reader ? hp front screen ? Info Print</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar application is outside the Office menu. It has its own separate place in the Main Menu. The Calendar has three views: Monthly, Weekly and Daily. Different notes can be assigned in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Month view ? Week view ? Day view of the Calendar</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other useful stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One application that was not mentioned before is the Nokia Lifeblog application. It is used for publishing to your blog directly from your phone. It works with most of the major blog service sites in the world. There are also some printing applications such as the Image print application for printing images from the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  My own submenu ? Imaging submenu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Entertainment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three preinstalled games in Nokia N72. As it is a Symbian 2nd Edition phone, it wouldn't be very hard to find tons of games to install on it. The three games are Card Deck, Snakes &amp; Snowboard 3D. The Card Deck game is an album of popular card games. Snake is a 3D version of the popular Nokia Snake game. Its rather difficult controls make it a real annoyance. The Snowboard 3D game is the best of the games as it has great graphics and is not very easy which motivates you to try again and again.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What's the point?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N72 is a very controversial phone. It lacks essential features like 3G and Infrared, it has less memory than other phones, the display is rather poor but still it is a pretty good phone. It comes in almost the same price as the N70 model but lacks some features. The main advantage is the tons of software and games for it as it is not a 3rd edition UI. Most probably people who fall in love with its design from first sight will be the main customers. Otherwise, it is hardly possible for Nokia N72 to become a market success.</paragraph>
