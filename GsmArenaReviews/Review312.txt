			<paragraph>One of the hottest PDAs around lately, the HTC TyTN II is one feature-loaded son-of-a-gun. It's got what it takes to quench your daily communication needs, and more: HSDPA/HSUPA, Wi-Fi, 2.8" touchscreen TFT display, hardware QWERTY keyboard, 3 megapixel camera with auto focus and a built-in GPS receiver. A 400 MHz processor is in charge of all that on a Windows Mobile 6.0 Pro platform. If that's more than enough to tickle our curiosity - and yours - we seem to have the right scratch: the HTC TyTN II review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Kaiser platform, which the HTC TyTN II is based on, is supposed to have several different flavors - one with no cameras whatsoever, another with only a primary camera and no video calling, and finally, the third one (which we are reviewing) has both a primary and a video-call camera. Currently, the HTC Kaiser is incarnated in a few units under different brands: HTC TyTN II P4550 (our test unit), T-Mobile MDA Vario III, AT&amp;T Tilt 8925, Vodafone v1615, and Vodafone VPA Compact V. It will be no surprise if more are to join the crew in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II is not groundbreaking in the Windows Mobile realm - it's hardly compact measuring 112 x 59 x 19 mm and weighing 190 g (much like the Qtek 9100 but heavier, or like the original HTC TyTN but slimmer). OK, the fellow has a belly, but it also has the guts. Besides HSUPA and the integrated GPS receiver, the sliding QWERTY keyboard is a definite highlight. Once you slide it down, you can tilt the display to as much as 120 degrees up, so that you can lay the device comfortably on your desk and get perfect visibility of the screen. Check out our 360-degree spin of the HTC TyTN II after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Slide and tilt<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II comes in an eye-pleasing black box with all the necessary gear to get you started - charger, USB data cable, stereo headset, spare stylus, and a carrying case, plus tons of paper about the device. The only thing we lacked was a memory card perhaps, but you can get one easily. We didn't like the case either, as it uses Velcro instead of a magnetic clip, which is always our preferred choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II doesn't run on a Samsung processor, unlike most previous models of the brand. Instead, this time the Qualcomm MSM7200 chipset platform is the power plant of this Pocket PC. A primary 400MHz Qualcomm ARM11 processor runs applications, while a secondary 274 MHz ARM9 microprocessor is in charge of radio equipment. The hardware specs include 128MB of RAM (double the size of the original TyTN) and 256MB of ROM (133MB are available to the user as storage space).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is dominated by the 2.8" 65K color touchscreen TFT display. It supports QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution only - and yes, we would have preferred VGA. Above the display, there is the video-call camera and the earpiece slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad below the display is the next thing to draw attention. It's rather packed, hosting a total of 8 keys plus the navigation button and its confirming center. The original TyTN had two keys above the display and that prevented the clutter of keys below the display. But the keys above the display tend to be somewhat uncomfortable when using the handset single-handedly, so lately HTC have ditched that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC TyTN II hosts a scroll wheel, an OK button and a Voice Dial button. They are really comfortable to use - the wheel is really soft and responsive, scrolling and selecting is a piece of cake. This key layout really gets to shine when you use the TyTN in desktop mode - holding it tilted in landscape view. In this case those keys are easily accessible with your right index finger. The voice dialing is not something we use often, especially as you have to pre-record voice labels to your contacts in the case of Windows Mobile. So, as there is no dedicated Communications Manager key, we were quick to reassign that function to the Voice Dial key. The Comm Manager is among the most frequently used applications on any Pocket PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the HTC TyTN II hosts only a couple of keys - the On/Off key and the camera shutter key. The camera will only start upon a longer press on the shutter key. That's good, as it's unlikely that you start your camera by accident. Otherwise the key is elevated enough and easy to use. That cannot be said about the On/Off key, which is rather hard to press and almost impossible to find in the dark, as it doesn't have any elevation whatsoever. That's a really bad move from HTC, with this key being probably the most used one in a Pocket PC, as it puts your portable computer in standby and wakes it back up. The stylus the TyTN II is equipped with, is the regular non-telescopic one that we're used to seeing on recent HTC devices - so no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the HTC TyTN II doesn't feature any controls at all. The bottom side however hosts the standard miniUSB port, microSDHC card slot, the wrist/neck strap hole, the microphone pinhole and the reset hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the device is made of matt plastic with a somewhat rubbery feel to it. It provides a firm grip, but is a real fingerprint magnet . Beside the camera lens/LED flash combo, there is also a rubber cap with a GPS sign on it. If you lift it up you will find an external GSP antenna connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It gets really interesting when you slide the keyboard down and take a look at the back. The SIM card slot is right behind the display. After you release the lock you can slide your SIM card in and close the latch shut. The SIM card however is not hot-swappable - removing it will shut down the Pocket PC automatically with no warning shots fired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the SIM card bed placed outside, you will hardly need to open the back cover. Even so, it gets removed easily to reveal the 1350 mAh Li-Poly battery. It's quoted at 400 h of standby time and up to 6 hours of talk time. In reality the handset lasts around a day with a single charge when you use it heavily. We also did a dedicated video playback battery test and the HTC TyTN II managed to keep on playing video (registered to a 3G network) for good 5 hours. It performed pretty much the same at the dedicated GPS test, where it scored 4 hours of continues GPS lock and lit up screen (again registered to a 3G network). We were a bit let down by the fact that it takes the battery good 3 hours to charge completely - but hey, it's an accumulator of serious capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN is pretty comfortable to work with but you can't exactly call it pocketable, so this PocketPC is best carried in its case strapped on a belt - there's no doubt about that. However, we found it nice to hold in hand and working with it was a pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Shiny player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We find the 2.8" 65K color touchscreen TFT display of the HTC TyTN satisfactory. It's on par with most PocketPC screens out there and it has the usual low legibility under direct sunlight - especially when it has fingerprint smudges all over. As it uses transreflective technology, it's better than the displays of most regular feature phones. However, given the small system font of Windows Mobile, it doesn't provide for adequate sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, there are a lot of people out there grumbling about display colors, since 65K seems rather old school, right? Well, old it is, but it's really not that bad. 262K colors is not a native thing to a 32-bit processor. Those processors prefer either 65K colors or 16M colors. However, displaying 16 million colors would certainly compromise performance (it's double the bits compared to 65K) - so it's a fair trade-off really. We know that there are some manufacturers claiming their PocketPCs have 262K color displays, but that's all they have - displays. Even if it's a 262K display, it still shows the same 65K colors everybody is grumbling about. And another thing - we really don't think that any of these disgruntled consumers have checked the actual difference between 65K and 262K colors when viewing a photo. There is none whatsoever - at least to the human eye, that is. The only scenario that you may get to spot a difference is with two-color gradients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, it's keyboard time already. The HTC TyTN II offers a heart-warming hardware QWERTY keyboard. Add the tilting display and you have yourself a great typing machine. The keys are slightly convex and pleasantly tactile. There's 41 of them. Two soft keys are available, that change function according to the context; there are two status lights too - one for the Caps Lock and another for the Fn (special function) key. The Fn key gives you several shortcuts - one of them lets you start the Wi-Fi right away. When the display is slid out but not tilted, all keys are easily accessible - that changes when you tilt the display as the upper row gets overlapped a bit. No big deal really. We should make a little note here, though - we would have preferred the display sliding to the right instead of left - it feels much more natural that way. On a second thought though, that would've rendered operating the scroll wheel and the OK key with the right index finger impossible in desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has white backlighting, which looks somewhat uneven. It's not that bad however, as the characters are perfectly legible in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We need not tell you that HTC TyTN II is more than a regular PDA. It's a mobile phone too and offers quad-band GSM support, so you can use it around the globe. Calling is trouble-free as you would expect. The Phone application is in charge of all call-related features. Custom-made for HTC, it has large virtual keys that allow easy one-hand operation (other manufacturers have rather similar solutions). In the upper right corner there's the Backspace key, below it is the Video call key and, finally, the Calls Log key. The thing we like most about Windows Mobile devices is that you hardly ever need to open your phonebook in order to dial a contact. You just open the Phone and use its built-in Smart Dial feature. As soon as you've punched a few digits, it automatically filters the available contacts by their numbers? and their names. It uses the letters assigned to each number key for that - but unlike a feature phone, it checks all the available combinations (much like T9 when writing). Smart dial even searches in your recent calls list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how HTC TyTN II stacks against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. As you would see, it stacks up realy high in our loudness ladder. Usually this is the case with most PocketPCs. You can find more information about the loudness test itself here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile 6 is not news anymore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We haven't reviewed a Windows Mobile 6 Pro device for you yet, but the OS has been around enough for everyone interested in Pocket PC to have become familiar with it. To start with, all Windows Mobile devices are pretty much the same software-wise, . Essentially, any PocketPC is just a software platform which you can expand according to your needs - there are so many applications out there and it's a growing business. So we acknowledge that any current PocketPC user would hardly need a review of the default Windows Mobile applications that come preinstalled with the device - they are always the same. The reason why people change their PocketPC with new ones is only the hardware equipment - they simply want snappier and more user-friendly hardware to run their favorite applications on. So as a rule, PocketPC fans and users will only be interested in the hardware part of this review. If perhaps some manufacturer comes up with an innovative preinstalled application of their own, the hard-working PocketPC scene will take care of passing it on to older models. We saw it happen with the HTC TouchFLO technology already. So really, buying your Windows Mobile device is just the start - much like your desktop Windows. You hardly ever think of the built-in functions of your desktop OS, you just use it to run useful applications on it, right? We think that should've made the point. Anyways, we'll still give you something on the software part for people new to PocketPC, as well as for those interested in what they get straight out of the box when buying the HTC TyTN II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice when you power up the HTC TyTN II is the custom HTC home screen. Of course, it's an add-on that simply comes pre-installed - you can install it on your PocketPC no matter what make it is. It's a really handy plug-in, as it offers five separate tabs with frequently used functions. The Home tab displays info about the time and date plus status indicators for unread messages, mail or missed calls. The Favorite people tab allows you to store quick dial shortcuts to people in your contact list that you call frequently (their images get shown too). The Weather tab is rather self-explanatory - it even gives you a weekly forecast. The Launcher tab stores several configurable shortcuts and, finally, the Sound tab offers quick setup of ringing profiles and your current ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ever since Windows Mobile 5, PocketPCs have had support for changing screen orientation. The screen rotates automatically once you slide the QWERTY keyboard out but there's also a system setting that lets you do that. You can have a look at the Home screen rotated to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for those of you that are not familiar with PocketPC, we should probably explain that those handsets have no "main menu" the way feature phones or Symbian S60 devices do. Instead, here you have the Programs menu and the Settings menu - they are almost all you need to access the PocketPC features. They are both accessible through the Start menu which, unlike the one in the desktop Windows, is an user configurable list of shortcuts to some favorite applications. Again, unlike the desktop Windows, the Home screen is not necessarily a place for your applications - instead you usually use the Start menu to access them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Comm Manager (short for Communication Manager) is where you turn all the connectivity features on or off, such as Bluetooth, WLAN, Data connection, etc. The HTC TyTN II has a nice custom skin for the Comm Manager with large keys that eliminate the need for a stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile 6.0 offers full multi-tasking to the extent that it makes it quite hard to shut down open applications. The OS is designed in such a way that it should remain fast and stable without having to close running applications. Those of you with longer experience with this OS however, will surely agree that it does not always work this way, especially in the case of particularly heavy applications when the available memory seems to drain rather fast. The Task manager for the currently running processes is hidden deep in the Settings menu, so you'd be better off installing a third-party application that allows quick access. Luckily, HTC have preinstalled such an application for us. A quick press on the upper right corner on the Home screen opens a list of the currently running applications. No system processes are shown, so you won't get confused by all those enigmatic names you've probably seen in the desktop Windows Task Manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile traditionally offers customization through themes but they only change the color scheme. You can of course change the wallpaper on the Home screen too, but that's pretty much all you get. In order to apply some more advanced customization, you would need a third party application. Those kinds of applications however usually eat up your RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding the HTC TouchFLO technology to HTC TyTN II is ?well, a nice touch. We first saw that used in the HTC Touch. Manufacturers are slowly realizing that Windows Mobile Pro devices will lose the user-friendliness battle if stylus is the only way to move around the interface. The TouchFLO technology is basically a software enhancement that allows the touch screen to recognize the difference between using the stylus and using your finger. It enhances user experience by allowing smooth scrolling with fingers. Without it, finger-scrolling of lists or web pages would've been impossible, leaving the side scrollbar as the only option. Bear in mind that TouchFLO is just a software thing - you can install it on your current PocketPC too (although it's not an official HTC download, of course).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sorting your day-to-day communication<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Mobile OS has an unlimited contact list with a plethora of available fields for each entry. Synchronization with MS Outlook is textbook. Unfortunately, there is no letter-by-letter search available in the phonebook so you're left with using the alphabetic filtering or scrolling all the way through the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending and receiving messages is done through the centralized Inbox. It has separate folders for SMS, MMS and email. SMS length is virtually unlimited, as well as the memory available for received and sent messages. Inside the multimedia editor you will find the useful option to create multi-page messages containing more than one melody, image or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Outlook Mobile email client supports POP3 and IMAP accounts. You can have multiple accounts and you can set the client to do automatic checks in regular time intervals. It has full support for sending and receiving attachments. There is also support for Direct Push. What it means is, instead of checking mail at regular intervals, your messages are delivered to you immediately once they are received by the mail server. The only condition is that your company's Microsoft Exchange server supports Direct Push. Windows Mobile 6.0 offers some upgrades to the email client in comparison to Windows Mobile 5.0 - now you have integrated search, plus support for HTML emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several text input methods with the HTC TyTN II, the QWERTY keyboard being the most obvious one. Beside it, there is also handwriting recognition and a virtual keyboard that you can tap on with the stylus. The Block Recognizer allows handwriting with single-stroke gestures, so you have to learn how to write that way (writing is done in a special box). The Letter Recognizer offers a more natural way to write, as you can input normal characters (writing again is done in a special box). With Transcriber you can write wherever you want on the screen in whatever style you may wish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Managing your files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The built-in file manager of the HTC TyTN II is the standard Windows Mobile variety. It does a good job finding the files you are looking for. The file manager can create new folders, copy and move files, set tracks as ringtones or simply send files to other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Picture gallery of Windows Mobile is an application called Pictures&amp;Videos and, as the name implies, you use it to browse the multimedia files in question. As far as pictures are concerned, you can zoom in and out, as well as preview them in landscape mode. The files are shown as either thumbnails or as a plain list. There's a shortcut that allows you to turn on the camera directly from this application. You can even do some basic editing on the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary multimedia player of all Windows Mobile devices is the preinstalled Windows Media Player. Besides music, it allows watching video and streaming TV. You can sort tracks by artist, album or genre and you can create custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have additionally installed the Audio Manager music player. It is a strange name for a music player but it does allow you to manage your music files easily - you can sort tracks by artist, album, genre, or composer. You can create unlimited custom playlists and the interface is optimized for finger operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Streaming Media application is another HTC touch to the software package of the TyTN II. It allows you to watch or listen to streaming content. It follows the same stylus-free design of the Audio Manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We installed a TCPMP player and the needed codecs to play DivX and XviD video files. The HTC TyTN II processor couldn't play movies at near-VGA resolution smoothly. We were forced to convert those to near-QVGA in order to play them. This doesn't speak that well of the 400MHz processor, as those kind of limitations used to apply to 200MHz PocketPCs such as the old but trustworthy Qtek 9100 (HTC Wizard). The original HTC TyTN does better at playing video files. Obviously, in that respect the 400MHz Qualcomm is no better than the 200MHz Texas Instruments processor of the HTC Wizard. But enough on that, we will only point out that, as we managed to confirm, the battery allowed the HTC TyTN II to play video continuously for a good 5 hours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice camera in a PocketPC at last<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>PocketPC are probably bottom of the ladder when it comes to camera performance. It's not about the megapixel count. It's just that their photos are really nothing to speak of. HTC were obviously addressing that and among the first results is the 3 megapixel camera with auto focus integrated into the HTC TyTN II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably imagine, the 2.8" TFT display is a really nice camera viewfinder to have. The TyTN II camera can be operated as a regular digital camera - a half press on the shutter key locks the auto focus and exposure, while pressing the key all the way down takes the actual snapshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera menu is easy to operate with your fingers only. White balance can be either automatic or custom set to daylight, night, incandescent or fluorescent. You can apply several color effects (Grayscale, Sepia, Cool, Negative) and use the special camera modes such as Panorama, Sports and Burst. In Burst mode the camera takes a total of 32 snapshots really fast for you to choose from but they are in VGA resolution only. In Sports mode it takes a series of up to 10 photos. In Panorama mode the camera takes three slightly overlapping images and stitches them automatically to create a panoramic shot. However, each individual shot is taken again at VGA resolution only. There is also self-timer and exposure compensation. The camera can also apply Date stamps on your photos. Should you choose, you can use the front video-call camera to take pictures and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you will notice, the image quality is not really on par with 3 megapixel cameraphones such as the Sony Ericsson K800, for example. The images suffer in terms of dynamic range. The colors usually are spot on, sometimes slightly washed out and very rarely far off (look at the red flower, which is actually dark orange). The macros come out just fine thanks to the auto focus. We did get a strange pattern in the top right angle in all photos. It's clearly visible when you shoot some uniform colored surface such as the sky. As our unit is a retail one, and similar complaints were reported elsewhere in the mobile community, we tend to think that this is an inherent fault with the TyTN II camera setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An intriguing feature is that with some registry tweaking you can make the device store GPS information in the EXIF of your snapshots. It comes handy, as you can later upload them to a GPS-enabled photo sharing portal and it will accurately report the geographical location where the pictures were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II camera captures MPEG4 or video in CIF resolution (352x288 pixels) at 20fps , which is agreeable. Alongside white balance and color effects, you can also set the Flicker adjustment, contrast, saturation, hue and sharpness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data transfers are of the essence<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is what matters most when it comes to PocketPCs - both wired and wireless. The HTC TyTN II has enough to show in that department. Direct USB connectivity allows seamless synchronization with MS Outlook. However you can also use Bluetooth 2.0 for that purpose. Speaking of wireless communication, we should mention there is no Infrared port (no big deal really!), but you have Wi-Fi at your disposal. You can also relay on the tri-band UMTS support plus HSUPA 3.6 Mbps. There are also GPRS and EDGE, so you always have data connectivity options available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TyTN II comes with the Internet Explorer Mobile web browser. It falls behind most of the third-party browsers out there and a few PocketPC manufacturers even ship their devices with an alternative web browser preinstalled (take Toshiba G900 and Opera Mini for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer has several interesting view options. You can have it fit the text to the screen, show everything in one column or show the website as it is. Landscape mode and fullscreen mode are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II is equipped with a GPS receiver and also supports Assisted GPS. It uses the QuickGPS application that comes preinstalled to download initial positioning data, which the GPS receiver can later use to quickly lock to satellites. The integrated Qualcomm gpsOne chipset is not as snappy as the SIRFStar III-based receivers we've used, but it's still good to have the thing integrated in your handset. The HTC TyTN II bundles the TomTom navigation software but you can only download one map for free. Charges apply for downloading extra maps. Navigation software is getting more affordable now, so you can easily find several alternatives by just googling around before you choose which one to buy. The good news is that you can use any navigation software you like as the integrated receiver is available through to every program that might need it. We successfully used iGo and Ozzy Explorer navigation software. When in GPS mode, the battery of the HTC TyTN II lasted about 4 hours of continuous use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Your office on the go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with MS Outlook. The Calendar is improved in comparison to the one used in Windows Mobile 5, as now it allows searching for events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. You can also hide weekends form the Calendar if you use it for business purposes only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder files also get saved to the notes folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. As a frequently used feature, Microsoft should have put more effort into making the alarm clock easily accessible. Instead, it's buried down in the Settings menu. Alongside you will also find the dual-zone clock. The Calculator is another well-known application (as ugly as it gets), which is among the few things in Windows Mobile intended for stylus-free usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other interesting applications that come with the HTC TyTN II are the Office Mobile, Adobe Reader LE, the ZIP manager, the Business card scanner, the Windows Live service and the Search application. The Office Mobile features support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint office files. The Adobe Reader LE opens Adobe PDF files, while the ZIP manager adds support for archived files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the applications can work in landscape mode, too. The screen rotation feature is nothing new though, as it has been available ever since Windows Mobile 5.0. As we mentioned earlier, sliding the QWERTY keyboard out automatically rotates the screen to landscape mode, however you can also rotate it through a dedicated system setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WorldCard Mobile is a business card scanning application preinstalled for you by HTC. It uses the camera to capture the business card and then does its character-recognition trickery to eventually return all contact details on the card ready for saving. Well, this isn't the first business card scanning application we see, and it is not that reliable. Even the application we saw in the Samsung U600 outperforms it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application is rather useful, as it searches throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so that the application searches only in places you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile 6 integrates Windows Live, which replaces the MSN search and messenger, which we know from previous versions. You can also download the application Live Search for free, that works great with or without the integrated GPS receiver. With it you can find information on local businesses, restaurants, places of interest and even gas prices (the service is currently available only to US and UK). It has nice support for speaker-independent voice recognition that you can use to do your searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Windows Mobile device is a rather versatile gaming platform thanks to the widely-available third-party developed games. Beside Java you also get the games developed natively for Windows Mobile. However, manufacturers usually go the more conservative route and ship their devices with only the default Windows Mobile games: Bubble Breaker and Solitaire, none of which is that amusing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II is a wonderful device and it packs in some nice features. Its design is high-tech, yet solid and functional. The communication capabilities allow using it in almost every out-of-the-office scenario. We liked the QWERTY keyboard and the notebook-like usability of the device. The integrated GPS receiver is another really cool feature. The battery too is on par with the rich feature set of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downsides we found with the TyTN II are that it doesn't have a VGA resolution display and it's not really pocketable. It doesn't have a 3D accelerator or USB host function either . The 400MHz Qualcomm processor is somewhat sluggish and is incapable of playing video at a resolution higher than QVGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So although the HTC TyTN II will be a highly sought after gadget, we don't find it to be the ultimate communication device. The particular mix of features will probably account for its high popularity but it fails to justify an upgrade from the original TyTN though, as the innovations it offers just don't seem to balance with the swollen price. However the HTC TyTN II is a great option if you are upgrading from an older device, or if it's your first step in the PocketPC world.</paragraph>
