			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Launched silently a few weeks back, the Samsung Ativ SE for Verizon Wireless ends a long break for the Korean manufacturer, and puts a fresh device in charge of their small Windows Phone lineup. The smartphone features top-end hardware tucked into a familiar looking body taken straight from last year's Samsung Android flagship, the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite frankly, considering the specs and features on offer, the low-key release of the Samsung Ativ SE is quite surprising. At a quick glance, it matches the significantly better marketed Nokia Lumia Icon on just about every level. Heck, it can even put the now Microsoft-owned phone to shame by offering useful features such as an IR blaster, a removable battery, and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the full list of the Samsung Ativ SE's talents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at the spec sheet shows that, by Windows Phone standards, the Samsung Ativ SE is as well-equipped as it gets. With beefy chipset, ample amount of RAM, as well as an easy update to Windows Phone 8.1, the smartphone is sufficiently future-proof too - it will not fall behind the update curve for some time to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardly a surprise, the Samsung Ativ SE does have a couple of downsides. Pundits will argue that the design of the smartphone has already been played out - it is essentially a Galaxy S4 with a new, shinier paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the matter of availability and marketing exposure. The Ativ SE is only available on Verizon Wireless in the United States, thus depriving the rest of the world from a worthy alternative to Nokia's dominant lineup. Within the Big Red's own Windows Phone lineup, the Ativ SE sits behind the much better marketed, though not necessarily better-equipped Nokia Lumia Icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we will kick our review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality walkthrough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE ships in a bright red box with Verizon Wireless branding. Inside you will find the handset, a microUSB cable, an A/C adapter, and a few booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A stereo headset would have certainly been a welcome sight out of the box. However, such practice is still rare among US carriers, unless it is a premium or music-centric device we are talking about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality, handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever wondered what the Samsung Galaxy S4 will look like with Windows Phone navigation buttons instead of the Android setup? The Samsung Ativ SE is the answer to the question - it is a near carbon copy of the Samsung Galaxy S4, save for the speaker design on the back and the shinier paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of, the handset's plastic body features a striking brushed aluminum finish. The latter is not unlike the much talked about LG G3 styling, though, to Samsung's credit, the Ativ SE beat the LG flagship to the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ativ SE build quality is stellar. Like the Samsung Galaxy S4 whose underpinnings it inherited, the Samsung Ativ SE is solidly built and ready to take on the rigors of daily life. Love it or not, the plastic finish of the device has proven to be quite sturdy. The same goes for the Corning Gorilla Glass-covered display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical measures of the smartphone are 137.7 x 69.9 x 8.4mm, while it tips the scales at 135.8g. Curiously, the device is a tad thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S4 (7.9 mm and 130 grams). We reckon the difference might be down to the newcomer's different finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like its looks, handling the Samsung Ativ SE is a familiar experience. Curiously, the handset even feels compact next to today's batch of Android flagship devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed metal finish of the smartphone handles fingerprints really well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung Ativ SE is the well-known 5" FullHD Super AMOLED unit, which made a debut last year in the Samsung Galaxy S4. The screen has a PenTile matrix and a pixel density of 441ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've always believed that AMOLED displays and Windows Phone make for a perfect marriage and the Ativ SE's unit shows why. With infinite contrast, punchy colors, and superior viewing angles, the display is still as solid as it was when it first came out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels of the Samsung Ativ SE are not very high. However, due to the screen's low reflectivity, this doesn't affect its outdoor performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you will find the earpiece, the front-facing camera, as well as the device's ambient light and the proximity sensors. A notification light and Verizon Wireless logo keep them company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the three Windows Phone navigation buttons. There are no surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker of the smartphone is located on the left. The power/lock key sits on the right side of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the devices accommodates the 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation, and an IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and the mouthpiece are located on the bottom of the handset. There is nothing else there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the smartphone shows, once again, a familiar setup. The 13MP camera sits on the top with the single LED flash below it. The speaker sits on the bottom. A Samsung and Verizon 4G LTE logo complete the setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the thin battery cover reveals the 2,600mAh battery, the SIM slot, and the microSD card slot. The latter will be a welcome sight for all multimedia hoarders considering the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card is hot-swappable too. You don't need to remove the battery to gain access to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE is powered by removable 2,600mAh battery. It propelled the Windows Phone device to the respectable endurance rating of 60 hours in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone posted a stellar standby result. Video playback and telephony endurance times came out impressive too. Web browsing on the other hand, didn't blow us away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our routine also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE is fully covered in the connectivity department. The smartphone sports quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE, quad-band 3G with HSPA, and Verizon-friendly LTE (band 13/4).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth, NFC, and microUSB 2.0 port with mass storage mode are also on board. An IR blaster is present too, along with a dedicated app which we will cover a little later in the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ SE boots Windows Phone 8 GDR3 out of the box. You can take a look at a short video of the smartphone in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lockscreen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a reasonable level of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to display notifications, weather, and images. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps to show a less detailed quick status. There are already apps in the Store that display the battery percentage on the lockscreen via those kind of notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - you can let the music player replace the lockscreen image with the album art of the currently playing track, or let one of the installed apps choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live Tiles, which can be reordered any way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more. Unfortunately, the app launcher is still just an alphabetical list of all apps, no folders or icon grid. We don't think it works too well on a large display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 lets you resize the live tiles. Upon a tap and hold, you'll get an extra resize button, next to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking, though not with the level of user control that Android allows. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). If an app needs to run in the background (sat-nav clients, messengers, etc.) it can though we've had variable success rate with messengers that run in the background such as Viber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Microsoft is delivering a much better multi-tasking with the Windows Phone 8.1 update and the Ativ SE should get the update just like the other Windows Phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new feature in GDR3 is that you can "close" apps by hitting the X button. It's not as comfortable as swiping apps away, but at least now you have control over the recent apps list. Windows 8.1 enables the swiping gesture as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu on the Samsung Ativ SE displays two sets of options: you can swipe between the System tab and the Applications tab. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes. Fortunately, Windows 8.1 offers such UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new setting as part of the GDR3 refresh - screen rotation, where you turn on/off the automatic UI rotation. It requires you to exit the app, find it in the settings, enable it and then get back to the app. The same goes for all the other settings, it's just too many steps for such a common task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another missing feature is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live Tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft will deliver that with Windows 8.1 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone comes with the Data Sense app, which shows you the amount of data you've used. Both cellular and Wi-Fi traffic is accounted for. There are different data limit types: one-time, monthly and unlimited. The first two accept custom bandwidth limit values, while the latter is applicable if you have an unlimited data plan, but would still like to track your usage. With GDR3 there's an option to prevent data usage when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data Sense can also restrict the background data usage for all apps if you are near a preset data limit. This will prevent some apps from functioning properly, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Driving Mode can be enabled automatically when the phablet connects to a specific Bluetooth device (i.e. your car's stereo). This mode mutes all notifications except calls and texts, but you can mute those too. If you do, you can set an automatic reply text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info relevant to their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ SE also supports voice commands - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Unfortunately, the Windows assistant is still far behind the competition as far as recognition speed and accuracy are concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly, for those who are interested, Microsoft offers an easy path to get a hold of a Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview. All you need to do is register as an app developer for free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ SE is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset with 2.3GHz quad-core CPU. The GPU is Adreno 330, while two gigs of RAM ensure that everything runs smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a few Lumia phones around for our performance test - the Lumia 630 with final WP8.1 version, Lumia 720, Lumia 1020 and Lumia 1520. We ran each benchmark on Windows Phone 8 with GDR3 and Nokia Black updates, and then we updated all three older devices (720, 1020, 1520) to the latest Windows Phone 8.1 Developer's Preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test measures the single-core performance by calculating the Number Pi. The Samsung Ativ SE did slightly better than the previously best Nokia Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pi Benchmark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Antutu was a similar story. The smartphone topped the charts here as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used the popular cross-platform BaseMark OS II compound benchmark. The Samsung Ativ SE came right behind the Nokia Lumia 1520 with Windows Phone 8.1 on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider measures the JavaScript rendering performance of the web browser. Once again, the Samsung Ativ SE topped the chart of Windows Phone devices we've tested this far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTML 5 test saw the smartphone drop behind the bunch of Windows Phone 8.1 device we tested. It is clear that its browser is no match for Internet Explorer 11.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTML 5 Test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Ativ SE proved to be the performance powerhouse we expected it to be, thanks to its hardware. A further small jump in performance is expected once Windows Phone 8.1 arrives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to build the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab has the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE offered loud and clear in-call sound. Signal reception was problem-free as well - hardly a surprise considering the quality of the Verizon network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. A live tile will show the number of missed calls, as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the loudspeaker was good. Missed calls are certainly not going to be a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails as read/unread, flag and unflag, etc. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with busy inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, NFC-enabled tap+send, messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player supports XviD, DivX, MOV and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode. Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE audio output turned out solid, if hardly impressive. The smartphone demonstrated excellent frequency response, very good noise levels and dynamic range, while its distortions levels were tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk is very good when no load is applied to the line-out, although it does rise significantly when you plug in a pair of headphones. Volume levels also failed to impress, falling in the below average category. Overall the performance of the ATIV SE is good, although not quite among the best we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ SE for Verizon Wireless packs the same 13MP camera sensor as the Galaxy S4. The camera features a single LED flash, though it lacks a dedicated button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone features two camera interfaces headed by the standard Windows Phone setup. It features capture options and settings on the right side and an arrow button to access the gallery on the left. Images are captured by tapping on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Ativ SE features a Samsung-exclusive camera app dubbed Shooting Modes. It closely resembles the layout and settings featured in the Korean giant's Galaxy lineup of smartphones. They include Auto mode, continuous shooting, beauty face, and HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional photography modes from Samsung are also available. They include Artistic Effects and Manga Camera, Fun Shot, and Color Effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE camera produces sharp images with plenty of detail. The colors turn out nice and so does contrast. Noise is really low, practically invisible in daylight. Edge-to-edge sharpness is even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only gripe is that the camera tends to overexpose the photos in scenes, which are even remotely high contrasty, preferring well developed shadowy areas instead of well preserved highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may be interested to know that the photos produced by both camera apps ? the stock Windows Phone one and the Samsung Modes ? have identical quality and processing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video capture is handled only by the Windows Phone app. Once again, the capture settings are laid out on the right side, with the arrow button on the left offering access to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p@30fps videos by the Samsung Ativ SE have a bitrate of around 20Mbps. It seems this is enough for the phone to produce some excellent videos with punchy colors and plenty of resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, thanks to the constant framerate, the motion is smooth, just as you would expect it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an 1080p@30fps camera sample, taken straight of the Samsung Ativ SE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a longer video sample from the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer on the Ativ SE is the classic Windows Phone 8 deal, which has hardly changed with the minor update of the OS. The 5" screen makes for comfortable browsing while the high pixel density keeps text sharp even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Word and Excel share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way. The app offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms, Calculator, and Weather apps are naturally pre-installed. Bing Search is on board too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster of the Samsung Ativ SE has been utilized via the WatchOn app. It has the same layout like its Android sibling and works with no hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More exclusive Samsung apps are available in a dedicated section in the Windows Phone marketplace. They range from live wallpaper, through image editor, all the way to multimedia sharing apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone's traditional Games app is present - it carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. It is also your gaming hub - here you can find all of your pre-installed games, spotlight news and store links.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no denying that the Samsung Ativ SE is one of the most capable Windows Phone smartphones available at the moment. With powerful, future proof-hardware, and easily updatable OS garnished with useful Samsung add-ons, the device makes for a mighty good alternative to the dominant Nokia Lumia high-end lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Korean entry trumps its Microsoft-owned rivals on a few key instances. It features expandable memory and removable battery - two features which are certain to appeal to the power user crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ SE key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR remote control and the camera modes, which have been borrowed from the Samsung Galaxy family, aren't too shabby either. They add a more capable, easy to utilize alternative to the stock camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Limited availability is the most notable downside of the Samsung Ativ SE. As big a carrier as Verizon Wireless is, the smartphone surely looks and feels worthy of a much wider release. We do firmly believe that it would have been warmly received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ SE is priced at $99.99 with a two-year contract. The price has become standard for a high-end smartphone this year, so here are some of the most notable options available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Nokia Lumia Icon for Verizon Wireless is the biggest challenger for the Windows Phone title. It offers a better camera and build quality than the Samsung device. However, it is significantly heavier than the Ativ SE and doesn't have expandable memory, removable battery, or an IR blaster.</paragraph>
