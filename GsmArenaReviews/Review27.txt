			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung had a slow start in Android but they are making up for it with some impressive high-tech devices. But the All-star team is certainly not leaving anyone behind and the Galaxy Spica just got its update to the latest Android 2.1. Now it's as ready as ever to hit the competition. And it hits hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Devices like the I9000 Galaxy S and the I8520 Beam certainly have the lead but it's down to the foot soldiers to clean up the mess when super AMOLEDs, Snapdragon and WVGA projectors leave the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of those - you'll know that when it's Samsung and a Galaxy, the middle name is Android. It holds true for the I5700 Galaxy Spica much as it did for the first-born Samsung droid ? the I7500 Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Spica goes by the name of Galaxy Lite in some markets, but this has nothing to do with processing power. It packs a faster CPU than the original Galaxy and, as a matter of fact, 800 MHz is better than most droids get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone we?re reviewing is no news really, but Android 2.1 certainly is. Given the OS upgrade, the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is obviously planning to stick around and turn the brightest star in this galaxy. Let?s see what it?s got under the belt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica normally comes with the Android Cupcake (v1.5) but you can upgrade it to the new Éclair (v2.1). That?s exactly what we did. Anyway, the Spica is still a first-gen droid on the outside: plenty of buttons and an average touchscreen ? in both size and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A thing to definitely note is TouchWIZ. In their first go at Android, Samsung were not too keen perhaps on customization. Under Android 2.1 the Galaxy Spica is a different story. It has the company?s custom touch interface on top of Android and although it?s not a complete overhaul, the first impressions are quite positive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the package is standard Android with some of the improvements ver. 2.1 implies. The Spica offers a wide range of connectivity options, including HSDPA support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You can transfer files over Bluetooth as well. Another Éclair goodie is not there however ? the Spica?s 3.2? capacitive screen does not support multi touch. The Live wallpapers feature is also not present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media have always been a Samsung forte and the 3.5mm audio jack and 3MP autofocus camera is the least the Spica can offer to assert this claim. What users will certainly cheer is the DivX/XviD video support right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, joins us on the next page for the Galaxy Spica unboxing and hardware check up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: the bare minimum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica retail box has no more than the bare essentials: a charger, a software CD and a microUSB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the box, you'll also find a one-piece headset which isn't your only option though since the Galaxy Spica is kind enough to offer a 3.5 mm jack. No memory card is enclosed though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Spica is just a tad thicker than its predecessor, the Samsung I7500 Galaxy. However, standing at 115 x 57 x 13.2 mm this smartphone is no hassle to handle and carry around. It?s quite solid too ? 124 g and a heavier feel in hand than you might?ve expected in an all-plastic phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The red accents on the Spica?s front bring some color to the Galaxy lineup. Those aside, the I5700 design didn?t stray far from the original Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica is made of high quality plastics. The rubbery back is soft to touch and surprisingly tends to attract fingerprints more than the glossy frame up front. However, in either case fingerprints are rather hard to see and quite easy to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the whole front of the I5700 Galaxy Spica is taken by the 3.2? capacitive touchscreen of HVGA resolution. The original Galaxy came with an AMOLED display, the Spica has got a TFT unit. Still it?s got some nice image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Spica screen fails to match the wide viewing angles and great contrast of the I7500 Galaxy. Another surprise is that the Spica disappoints on sunlight legibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the display is bright and vibrant, with pleasing solid colors indoors. It?s a capacitive unit with silky smooth response. Most importantly, thanks to the latest version of Android, the Spica screen has true 16M color support and the color banding issues plaguing earlier Android phones do not affect it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the centrally located earpiece. There are no ambient light and proximity sensors on the Galaxy Spica.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there are a handful of buttons. A D-pad with confirm button is surrounded by no less than six hardware keys. Typical for the early Androids, the Spica has actual Call and End keys, along with the standard foursome: Home, Menu, Back and Search buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front hardware buttons are generously sized and have a very pleasant click. Our only gripe is with the Home key, which is right at the very corner. It?s therefore hard to keep a solid hold of the phone when you need to press it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short press on the Search key will open the Quick Search Box while a longer press will start the Voice Search app. The Home key on the other hand will either bring you back to the homescreen (upon a single press) or will launch the task manager (if you press and hold).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the phone hosts only a volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, you?ll find the lock key and the shutter button. The shutter key is disappointing. It doesn?t have a half-press, which almost makes it feel like there is no proper autofocus. There is of course, but we?re not fond of how the Spica handles shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press on the shutter key will lock focus (which can be quite slow really) and then you release to capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has the microUSB port, a lanyard eyelet and a standard 3.5mm audio jack. The USB port (used for both data and charging) is covered, but the audio jack is left exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic rear has a rubbery finish, which improves the grip and is nice to touch. The things to note there are the 3MP camera lens and a single loudspeaker grill. There?s no flash whatsoever on the Spica.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2-megapixel autofocus camera lens is sunk and enclosed in frame which is the only means of protection against scratches. It is placed in the top left corner, so your support finger tends to occasionally smudge it all over. The loudspeaker grill has a small knob, so it doesn't get muffled on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the rear cover, both the SIM compartment and the memory card slots are easily accessible on the sides and you don?t have to remove the battery to get to them. The Galaxy Spica supports microSD and microSDHC cards. It had no problems handling our reasonably full 16GB microSDHC card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is massive - 1500mAh are said to keep the Galaxy Lite up and running for up to 650 hours and allow up to 11.5 hours of talk time. In reality we had to charge the phone rather often ? almost every day at some point when testing was getting too intense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica handles nicely even if it's not the most compact of phones, and the hardware controls are quite comfortable. It sits well in the hand and feels sturdy. We have no reason to question the phone's long-term durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive screen is nicely responsive and the effective 16M color support does make a difference. Early Android adopters will know what we mean. The Éclair update hasn?t brought multi-touch support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we?ll take a closer look at the I5700 Galaxy Lite user interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android, the TouchWizzard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is the first Android handset to have a taste of the Samsung home-brewed TouchWiz UI. Tweaking up a few parts of the interface in terms of both functionality and looks, it?s a pretty decent first try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes start from the homescreen where up to nine panes are available to fill up with widgets. Unlike the HTC Sense, you don?t have to use all the screens all the time so if you don?t need that many deleting the extra ones will speed up the navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool extra of the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is the option to set any of your (currently active) homescreens as the default one (that would be the one to always go back to by pressing the home key). Besides, you can easily rearrange the whole screens, instead of having to move the widgets around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also added 6 widgets of their own, available under ?Samsung widgets? when adding content to your homescreen. Those include three different clocks (analogue, digital and a dual digital, showing two time zones at the same time), an internet widget holding a few bookmarks, Memo widget, which enables quick notes and a photo frame. Those hardly contribute a great deal to usability but they are still nice to have at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the Galaxy Spica has four buttons docked on the bottom of its homescreen typical TouchWiz style. They give you quick access to the dial pad, messaging, phonebook and web browser. Those move to the top when you open the main menu and are thus always visible. You are free to rearrange the four icons but removing them or replacing them with others isn?t an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has also been modified and now consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid. A new pane is added automatically each time the existing ones fill up. Again nine panes is the maximum you can have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica packs the updates brought by Android 2.1, like several new widgets. There?s no sign of the Live wallpapers and you will have to root the phone and install an additional homescreen app to enable them. Unfortunately, users report their performance is not that good so it's not really worth the fuss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Android version and the TouchWiz overlay aside, two of the key assets of the Galaxy Spica platform have remained unchanged. The Task switcher and the notification area look exactly the same as in the previous versions. Get this right, we are not complaining here ? those are just great to have around and really boost the Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general user experience provided by the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica running on Android 2.1 is pretty good, but the generally inconsistent performance is a pretty big issue at this stage. Apparently the handset is pretty well prepared hardware-wise (you can see the benchmark results below) but the software needs quite some further optimization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the apps are fine even at this stage and the interface is pretty snappy but exceptions like the camera and the gallery are too great to overlook. We will speak about that in more detail later in the review, but those tend to lag much more often than we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to guess we would say that the low amount of RAM (rumored 128MB) doesn?t allow much stuff to be cached and so needs to be loaded every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now for the promised benchmark results. As you can see from the screenshots below the Galaxy Spica has just about the performance that you can expect from an 800 MHz CPU. In terms of pure computing power, it ranks well above of the 600 MHz HTC Legend but falls short of the 1GHz Snapdragon inside the XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics performance however tells a different story with the Galaxy Spica coming second to the Legend but having a comfortable lead over the XPERIA X10. The resolution also counts here with the Sony Ericsson handset needing to refresh almost triple the number of pixels of the Spica but the results of the Samsung are still pretty pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get an even better idea of the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica performance you can check out the video below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is the usual good stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Android-running smartphone, Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica packs a phonebook with extensive functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is unable to display the SIM contacts unless you choose to import them but that is basically our only grudge against it. You can search the available contacts by either flick-scrolling the list, using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI) or by pressing the hardware search key and typing a part of their name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 2.1 the Galaxy Spica has also received the so called Quick contacts. Those let you use the contact photo in the phonebook and to call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade brought by the new version is the support for multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign an IM nickname to contacts, as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. There is also the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is doing fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica caused us no trouble during calls. There were neither reception issues nor in-call voice quality drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is some kind of smart dialing on board but it?s not exactly useful. Once you tap in some digits the Galaxy Spica shows the contacts in your phonebook whose numbers contain them. Now, we don?t know if you have the habit of remembering the numbers of your contacts but we certainly don?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Galaxy Spica lacks a proximity sensor so you will have to be careful not to press something on the screen with your cheek while in a call. Luckily Samsung have find a way to minimize this chance by leaving the dialpad as the only available control and you need to slide it upwards and not just press for it to appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The immediate consequence is the need to go through several menus if you actually want to press something ? like take a note or write down a phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Spica. We weren't overwhelmed but the Spica still snatched a good score, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well taken care of<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s search functionality that allows you to quickly find a specific message among all your saved SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. The "undelivered messages" section however has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica also sports a common inbox, which combines all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is new mail needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text input is concerned, the Galaxy Spica offers the traditional landscape and portrait QWERTY keyboard options. Those are reasonably comfortable to type on and while no match for a hardware keyboard, they will do the job for most of the users just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery could?ve been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 lacks the cool 3D view that we saw in the Nexus One but it offers two options for the image thumbnails. You can either go for 24 small image thumbnails or 12 larger ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports gesture controls like scrolling images or finger panning so you can alternate images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or to the right when looking at a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t pinch-zooming but the one-finger zoom more than makes up for it. There is also double tap zooming if that?s what you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, we notice the strange bug of the Android galleries that fails them to properly zoom images to 100%. When zoomed, the Android handsets only load downsampled and heavily compressed versions of the images (to improve speed we guess) that can make you think your photos lack detail when you view them on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, there are two important upgrades brought by the new OS version. You have the multiple marking that allows mass cut/copy/delete and Bluetooth file transfers from the gallery. There is also the handy option to upload images directly to Facebook and Picasa or send them by MMS or email.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does the DivX/XviD thing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is among the best performers in the Android family as far as video playback is concerned. In addition to packing a dedicated video player app (though playing videos through the gallery is still possible) it also has DivX and XviD video support, which is very rare in the Google OS family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with higher-res videos is really good, the Galaxy Spica handling VGA videos at 30 fps with little to no issues. 720p crosses the line but having such videos on your handset is pretty unlikely anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the video player itself is as simple and as it could possibly be. You get a list of all videos available on the phone and the controls while playing a video boil down to play/pause and skip buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player: overdue update is here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz UI has reskinned the music player on the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica. The interface consists of several tabs for the sorting options: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove those you don?t need, to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung have made the Galaxy Spica the first Android to feature equalizer presets. The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song in YouTube or through Google search is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the added eye-candy things are almost as good as they can get now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is not only pretty loud with headphones connected but also capable of providing high quality audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off extreme bass frequencies and the higher-than-average intermodulation distortion are its only shortcomings but none of them is too bad actually. And the rest of the readings are just great and comparable to the best in class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here comes the table so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica wears a 3-megapixel autofocus camera lens on its back for a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It?s one of the things that got downsized compared to the I7500 Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash got dropped too and while the Galaxy Spica has a dedicated shutter key, it cannot be half pressed. Instead of half pressing, you press to lock focus and release to capture. As of Android 2.1 the Android camera interface has been swapped out for Samsung?s own touch-cam UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It keeps the most commonly used options a touch away ? things like mode switch, scenes, ISO and brightness. These icons can be hidden but the viewfinder has black bars at the sides, so only half the icon is actually covering up the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Extra features like geotagging, white balance, color effects and so on are accessible from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have two complaints and one bug to report. The complaints are simple ? the auto-focus is slow and the camera is generally laggy. The bug however is more, um, bugging ? when you turn on the camera the exposure is way off and the photos end up overexposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way to fix it is to snap a throwaway photo and the exposure for the second photo will be okay. It?s a very annoying software bug that should be fixed or you?ll end up throwing away a lot of badly exposed photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn?t expect too much out of 3MP photos, but the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica performs very well in its category - if you manage to avoid exposure problems that is. Noise levels are kept in check and there?s a fair amount of resolved detail. Colors are good but you can spot signs of oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica. You can check out what that test is all about here. There?s a noticeable pink spot in the center of the photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>CIF video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica captures CIF videos (352 x 288 pixels) at 15 fps. Videos are recorded in low bitrate so there are a lot of artifacts, banding and the video is choppy ? good enough for MMS and nothing else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to that of the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the maximum duration of the clip, set up the self timer, adjust ISO, brightness and recording mode (normal or MMS ? which is to say bad or worse).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica covers its connectivity basics ? worldwide roaming ready quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSDPA rated at 3.6Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to local connectivity ? the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica offers Wi-Fi (b/g), Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.1 enables file transfers over Bluetooth, so there?s little else left to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica supports microSD cards of up to 32GB, though the slot is under the battery cover. Still, for the first loading of the card with all your music, photos and videos the microSD card and card reader combo is the fastest way to do it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser 2.1 is good but Flash is still missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is the product of the Web 2.0 era and its browser is excellent. With its latest iteration of the OS, the level of usability has reached competitive levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalistic (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and +/- zoom buttons. The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls auto-hide ? that?s essential for web apps because they need to have the whole screen estate to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica browser in its latest iteration supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and one finger zoom. Pinch-zooming is missing, despite the native OS support, but some prefer one finger zoom anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow ? a moment after adjusting the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last castle of the Web that the Android Browser has yet to storm is Flash. HTC worked some black magic to include it, but that hasn?t been included into the core Android system so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica relies on the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but alas those are out of Spica?s reach.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer misses a document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica comes without a document viewer so you have to rely on the Android Market to source one. There are both free and paid versions, but keep in mind that most free versions require an Internet connection to do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card (it can?t access the internal memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica also comes with an app that allows you to run the good old Java apps ? we tried the Opera Mini Java, and it was sluggish but did work, touchscreen and all. Simple games should work well enough. Of course, there?s a native Android version of Opera Mini if you are into it, we just used the Java for testing the Java performance of the Galaxy Spica.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, comes the YouTube app which, as we said, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica comes with a capable GPS receiver, which gets a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation through Google Maps is available in the US only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica doesn?t come with third-party SatNav solutions preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the latest version of the OS and the most common screen resolution, the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica has unrestricted access to the Android Market. The number of apps in the market is ever growing and a recent survey showed that it has the highest free-to-paid apps ratio out of all the app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists sub-categories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. Do keep an eye on this tab ? when updates become available for an app you?ve installed, a label shows up next to the app name to notify you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screen shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications range from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell), through fun (e.g. a virtual guitar) to real must-have's (including office document viewers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We haven?t had a Tweaks &amp; Modding section in a while, so we decided to drop a few lines about modding your Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the Galaxy Spica runs Android v2.1 it doesn?t have live wallpapers like the Nexus One has (you know, the animated interactive backgrounds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a way to add them, but it comes at a price ? for one you have to root your device and you have to replace the Samsung-made homescreen with a third party issue like Launcher, Launcher2 or aHome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are reports that the live wallpapers get laggy sometimes, so they might not be as smooth as on the Nexus One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this forum thread for instructions and guidance on how to install Live wallpapers on your Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica (including links on how to root it, if you?re into it). As usual, we take no responsibility if any of these tricks goes bad for your phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rate of Android proliferation is matched by no other platform on today?s market ? you only need to look as far as the review section of our site, which is swamped with droids of all shapes and sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The likes of Nexus One, HTC Desire, Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and Motorola MILESTONE make up the Android elite, the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is priced and spec?d in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a reasonably cheap buy into the Android world, which opens the doors to a well-stocked Android Market and all sorts of cloud-based features (Google?s Near Me Now and the likes come to mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android is shaping up to be the multitasking OS to buy ? the iPhone OS and Windows Phone 7 can?t, Symbian^3 is still in future tense. Windows Mobile 6.1/6.5 or Symbian S60 are ageing platforms. Maemo and WebOS have limited reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica doesn?t have its quirks. The CPU may be clocked at 800MHz (faster than most Androids) but the UI is still laggy. The camera acts up, but those are things that can potentially be fixed with a software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Spica specs detail the archetypal Android ? no real deal-breakers, but no mind-blowing features either. Maybe some other phone with roughly the same asking price will be better suited for your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I7500 Galaxy immediately jumps to mind ? you?d find it for less than the Galaxy Spica but it tops it with an AMOLED screen, 8GB built-in storage, better camera and it?s actually thinner. The CPU speed and RAM are set noticeably lower though and the I7500 Galaxy hasn?t gotten a taste of Eclair yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I7500 Galaxy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If price is key, look no further than the HTC Tattoo ? it?s got the pedigree, it?s greatly customizable and matches most of what the Galaxy Spica has to offer at a bargain price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you could be willing to part with some more cash for sweet perks like aluminum unibody (HTC Legend). Or go all in with an HTC Desire or a Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. If you need a physical keyboard, the Motorola BACKFLIP and the MILESTONE are at your service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    HTC Legend ? HTC Desire ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 ? Motorola MILESTONE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, for the price gap between the Galaxy Spica and, say, the XPERIA X10, you could buy a point-and-shoot digicam that will outdo the X10?s 8MP shooter. You won?t have a 4? touchscreen or the Snapdragon CPU and so on, but still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could also take a walk on the wild side, by which we mean pick another OS or even a feature phone. There?s so many to choose from, but here are a few examples, each with its pros and cons ? be it the camera, the screen, free navigation or office document editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? Samsung S8000 Jet ? LG KC910i Renoir ? HTC Touch Diamond2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we?ve come a long way since the days when ?Android? meant either an HTC Dream or Magic. There?s choice ? lots of it ? and the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica is a great option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not a silver bullet though, not a crowd pleaser. The Samsung Galaxy Spica probably won?t be a bestseller, but it?s on the recommended reading list. If your operator has a sweet deal, the Samsung Galaxy Spica can be quite the thing for you.</paragraph>
