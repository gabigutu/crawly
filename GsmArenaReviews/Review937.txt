			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung UNPACKED 2013 Episode II event in Berlin brought us three new Galaxy devices, just as expected. The Galaxy Note 3 phablet is definitely the most eagerly anticipated one among mobile phone fans, but Samsung has also refreshed the Galaxy Note 10.1 slate and brought us the brand new Galaxy Gear smartwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the successor to the world's most famous phablet - the Galaxy Note II. It has been rumored for quite some time and as usual, most of those rumors turned out to be the truthful. The Note 3 brings a huge 5.7" Super AMOLED 1080p display, runs on world's most powerful chipset to date - the Snapdragon 800, and offers a new 13MP camera capable of 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Pen is what actually makes the Note lineup so special, and Samsung has surely provided the Note 3 with even more S-Pen compatible apps, handwriting-recognition features and drawing tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also one more thing different about the new Note - it arguably looks better than ever (if though not everybody here at the office agrees). Samsung has its entire back to look like leather and the Note 3 looks just amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the leather back, the Note 10.1 2014 has received the same treatment and it looks gorgeaous as well with the white version being our favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has decided to take after Apple's naming convention and chose not to rename the new Galaxy Note 10.1 slate any further. It is going to be known just as 2014 edition, but will keep away any additional numeration from the name. That?s sad as lately, the confusing iPad naming scheme as of late is the only thing no other manufacturer should try to copy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Galaxy Note 10.1 comes with 10.1-inch WQXGA (2560x1600px) SuperClear LCD display and also runs on the snappy Snapdragon 800 chipset. Android 4.3 Jelly Bean as in charge of things, while the S-Pen functionality has been greatly improved, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, it seems everyone will be soon or later joining the smart watch party. Samsung has announced the Galaxy Gear smartwatch. The gadget runs on a custom-built 800MHz processor and is intended to be a companion to the Galaxy smartphones and phablets, not a separate Android device. Mind you, it will only operate with certain high-end models and some would need to be updated in order to be compatible, such as the Galaxy S4, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we've spent some quality time with all three gadgets and we are ready to tell you all about them. Our exclusive tour starts right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy Note 3 hands-on: hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note family gets credit for convincing millions of people that large phones are actually pretty awesome. People even started calling them by a new name - phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to phablets it's all about the screen and the one on the Note 3 is even bigger, measuring 5.7" which at 1080p resolution works out to 388ppi pixel density. It's Samsung's own Super AMOLED and it looks stunning as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One uncommon characteristic of the screens of Galaxy Notes is the extra digitizer, which detects the defining feature of the line, the S Pen. We'll get back to the S Pen later on as it really is such an important part of the Galaxy Note 3 experience, especially with the latest custom features that Samsung has developed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 is more rectangular than its predecessor and its bezels have been slimmed down and the height and width of the device is virtually the same, despite the screen size increase. It also helps that the new Note 3 is over a millimeter thinner than the previous Note (8.3mm vs. 9.4mm) and it's lighter too - 168g (down from 183g). We've handled phones that weigh more than this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic around the screen is matte and has a brushed metal texture to it and comes in the standard Jet Black, Classic White and Blush Pink (don't worry, if you want more hues there are a ton of back covers, more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, all of the Note 3 is plastic even if most of it doesn't feel like it. The sides have what looks like a grooved metal strip, but that's plastic too. The grooves are not only an attractive design element, but they also improve grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the phablet is quite busy - the Galaxy Note 3 is the first mobile device to feature USB 3.0 using the micro version of the port. The connection consists of two parts - one that is backwards compatible with microUSB 2.0 and one that adds additional pins for faster data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also at the bottom is one of the mics, the loudspeaker grille and the S Pen housing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features another mic and the 3.5mm audio jack, plus the IR blaster that Samsung has been putting on some Galaxy devices this generation. The left side features the volume rocker and the right the power button with yet another mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get to the back, which (and we're not exaggerating here) is a massive improvement over the Note II back. With the Galaxy Note 3, Samsung has stuck to using plastic again, but this time around it has a great-looking leather texture. Best of all it feels similar to actual leather rather than a tacky imitation, and the faux-stitching is a great touch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we like about the leather texture is that unlike the glossy hyperglazed plastic, it doesn't become a smudgy, slippery mess as soon as you touch the device. We hope Samsung releases such covers for the Galaxy S4 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera on the back is joined by an LED flash. While the 16MP rumors didn't pan out, the 4K video recording rumors did but it's important to note that only the Snapdragon 800 version of the Note 3 will have that option - the Exynos 5 Octa edition will not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800 version will be the only one with LTE support too, which makes us wonder why Samsung even bother making an Exynos version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, 4K video is captured at 30 frames per second, requiring extra processing power. Instead of the higher resolution, though, you can use that to get higher framerate - 1080p @ 60fps or 720p @ 120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pop off the back cover to reveal the 3,200mAh battery (we were hoping for a bigger bump in capacity) along with the microSIM and microSD card slots. The slots are stacked on top of each other like they were on the Galaxy Mega 6.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom slot holds the microSIM card, which is blocked by the battery, while the top slot is for the microSD card, which can be removed even with the battery in place. The Note 3 comes in 32GB and 64GB versions, but with a microSD card slot we doubt many people will go for the 64GB option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 feels big in the hand but by no means too big or too heavy. If you're using a Note II (or even an original Note) you won't bat an eye at the size of the Note 3. It feels sturdy and well put-together despite its primarily plastic build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy Note 3 back covers and cases<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While we quite liked the leather back cover (we preferred the white one over the black one), you're not stuck with it - Samsung showed off a number of alternative covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, there are leather back covers in a whole range of colors. And if you don't like faux leather textures, there also matte plastic back covers in pastel colors, which are pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the Galaxy Note 3 itself will come in Black, White and Pink only at launch - that determines the color of the front, which cannot be changed. Knowing Samsung, there will be at least a Red version of the Note 3 before long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip (made of actual leather) are available in two versions - with and without a window on the front. S View covers are the ones with a window, which allows the phablet to display notifications. The other covers, Flip Wallets, look more like a leather-bound notebook, which might appeal to some people more than at-a-glance notifications. That's what the Galaxy Gear is for, right?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy Note 3 software features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 runs on the latest available Android Jelly Bean version plus Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz user interface on top. The TouchWiz has change a lot with the Galaxy S4 flagship, but Samsung still managed to pull a few new tricks for the Galaxy Note 3 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, let's talk about the new S-Pen features. You'll find pretty much every S-Pen-enabled app that premiered with the previous Notes pre-installed on the Note 3. But once you pull the S-Pen out, you won't be greeted with the old S-Pen dedicated home tab. Instead the OS will pop up the new Air Command menu. The new menu is available everywhere throughout the UI too, you just need to press side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition works impressively fast and accurately and will handle the rest for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to...well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the screen wherever you are. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 3 with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It automatically pops up once you hover with your S-Pen over a text field so you can enter handwritten text. In case something goes wrong, or the device does not activate the Pen Window for you, just use this shortcut to the handwriting service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video showing how these new Air Commands work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed another cool update to the TouchWiz UI - the multi-window multitasking now allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Chrome windows next to each other. There is also dedicated shortcut that lets you switch the places of the two opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff from one of the opened apps to the other is now available and is done in just three taps. It's a definite improvement and something the multi-window feature needed badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the way. It's a feature that will be used really often and we are happy to see Samsung extending its support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the Android OS and TouchWiz look pretty much the same as we've already seen on the Galaxy S4 and even on the Galaxy Note II. We are sure there are some other awesome features lurking underneath the UI, and are already eager to get our hands on this phablet in our office and start exploring all of its secrets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera with 4K video recoroding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 features a 13MP at the back that supports 4K@30 fps, 1080p@60 fps and 720p@120 fps video recording. If you choose to record a 120fps video, you'll then get to pick either to play it as a slow-motion 720p video at 30 fps or just run it as it is on 120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the 4K video capturing will be available only to the Snapdragon 800-powered Galaxy Note 3. On a positive note, the S800 Note 3 will be most common device on the market anyways, so it's likely that model will be in your area. If you live in a developing LTE market, then the S800 model will likely be the only one selling in your region, because the Exynos 5 Octa version doesn't have built-in LTE support. Bummer!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the third device running on the Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 800 chipset we meet. It is powered by a quad-core 2.3GHz Krait 400 processor, an Adreno 330 graphics and has 3GB of RAM. It also packs a 1080p display, so we can easily compare the performance of the new chipset to the old generation processors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait 800 processor clocked at 2.3GHz is currently the fastest processor on the market. We start with a single-core test and we were treated to quite the result. The Note 3 had absolutely no problem topping our BenchmarkPi tests chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we put all four cores to the test with the multi-core version of the Linpack benchmark. The Note 3 didn't disappoint again, easily beating the entire competition here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu evaluates the overall device performance instead of just the CPU, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and its Snapdragon 800 chipset shine again though it couldn't beat the LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to test the Adreno 330 graphic processing unit. We ran both of the GLBenchmark tests in offscreen mode, testing raw GPU power. The Galaxy Note 3 easily outpaced all other phones we've tested so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Adreno 330 GPU on the Galaxy Note 3 supports OpenGL ES 3.0, which was recently added to Android (with 4.3). Since the Galaxy Note 3 is already running on Android 4.3, it's reasonable to expect better performance over other Snapdragon 800-powered droids running on an older Android 4.2 version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 browser is the best we've seen so far. Since SunSpider has recently released a new v1.0.1, we had to update the old scores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is currently the fastest smartphone (phablets included) on the market right now. There's a noticeable performance lead over the Snapdragon 600 competitors and it even outperforms the Snapdragon 800 competitors by a whisker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 turned out as good as we all hoped it would be - a worthy successor of a worldwide best-seller that improves on pretty much every aspect - design, display, camera, S-Pen functionality, and software features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note devices are the phablet pioneers and whoever wants to compete in this niche, has to go against the Note's reputation and followers. Samsung has done an amazing job in protecting the Note lineup brand with yet another excellent yearly upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year's Note goes FullHD, gets an amazing camera on board and upgraded S-pen functionality. It runs on the market's most powerful chipset to date and even records 4K videos. What many fans will appreciate is the new leather-like back that makes the Note 3 look like a very-expensive premium-crafted gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 has definitely been worth the wait and we are already counting the days until a working unit lands in our office and we get the chance to explore it. It is, after all, a gadget that deserves everyone's attention.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Gear hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is entering the smartwatch arena with full force having just announced the Samsung Galaxy Gear - a 1.64" smartwatch with a Super AMOLED display that promises to be the gadget of tomorrow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strong words, but they are coming from a manufacturer that tends to deliver on its promises. Naturally, we rushed to the test area to give you our opinion on this little fella's abilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gear utilizes a 1.63" Super AMOLED display. It boasts a resolution of 320 x 320 pixels, which is quite high for a smartwatch. In comparison, the Sony SmartWatch 2's 1.6" display has a resolution of 220 x 176 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED display means the black pixels aren't actually lit. This means improved battery life on a dark user interface as well as vibrant and saturated colors. The display is surrounded by a metal frame. You also get to pick between four backgrounds for the screen, but the default black one is the one working best in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes the Samsung Galaxy Gear tick is an 800MHz custom-built single-core Exynos processor and 512MB of RAM. It's a bit sluggish at times, which can be irritating. Granted, we did play with pre-release unit, so the retail version has an every chance to be improved in this area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Samsung Galaxy Gear isn't too shabby, although it's not as jewel-grade as a high-end wristwatch. It carries more of a geeky appeal, but then again, that's probably good for a smartwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic band is full of trickery and is probably as important as the watch itself. For one it holds the 1.9MP camera with a BSI sensor, which protrudes slightly, but not so much so that it's awkward or uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can capture low-resolution photos as well as 10-second-long 720p videos, which are saved on the 4GB on-board memory. Any shot you take with it automatically gets uploaded to the smartphone or tablet if paired. The Galaxy Gear has its own gallery too, but you don't get to browse your complete gallery just the shots that are uploaded on the watch itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the actual strap, which holds the Galaxy Gear speaker (the microphone is on the plastic bit under the display). It allows you to conduct hands-free calls directly from the Gear. Audio notes are also supported. They are automatically uploaded to your Note (some other Samsung devices will also be supported too). Once that's done, the smartwatch gives you the transcript of your note. We find that to be actually pretty cool and quite handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right edge, there's a power button for waking and putting the Gear to sleep. Additionally, there's an "auto on" function, which uses the gyro and automatically switches the screen on when you turn your wrist towards your face. It works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In spite of the Samsung Galaxy Gear's innards, it's really intended to be as a companion device for the Galaxy Note III or Galaxy Note 10.1 (2013), and not a standalone gizmo. Since Samsung wants you to use the Galaxy Gear in tandem with the Galaxy Note III, there's a dedicated app that helps you configure the smartwatch from the phablet (or tablet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has spent a lot of time polishing the software running on the Galaxy Gear. The main screen is, of course, the clock face. As much as 10 different styles are available at launch including dual clock and weather info. Soon after the Galaxy Gear's launch, Samsung will out an app to let you design your own, unique clock face, so the options will virtually be countless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the productivity side of the software suite, the Galaxy Gear enables you to start calls, check call logs and even read SMS texts. MMS is also supported, but only the title is displayed with a shortcut to view the multimedia message in its entirety to your big Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option is to disable the lockscreen password/pattern on your Note, when the Galaxy Gear is nearby. If you are within two-three meters you can unlock the Note with a simple slide. Move further away and the pass-protection kicks back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an app that lets you locate your phone with the Gear watch and vice versa - it makes the other one ring (you do need to be in Bluetooth range of course). In fact, Samsung says the Galaxy Gear to supports more than 70 different apps including Twitter, Facebook, Evernote, Path, RunKeeper, MyFitnessPal, TripIt, Line, Vivino, eBay, Pocket, Banjo and Atooma.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weeks prior to the Galaxy Gear launch there were quite a lot of rumors suggesting a considerably brief battery life - some reported even suggests about 10 hours of battery life. Thankfully, Samsung has debunked those rumors and has officially stated that expected battery life is about one full day, thanks to the 315mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, that's not too great either, but there will be a cool charging stand that automatically rotates the display and turns the Galaxy Gear into a nightstand clock. At least when you have to charge the watch, you'll do so in style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gear will be available in six color variations - a more serious and stylish black as well as the traditional white will be accompanied by more "colorful" options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's goal with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is to bring productivity on tablets to a whole new level. Last year's Galaxy Note 10.1 brought split-screen mode that gave users two apps to work with instead of one. The stylus brought the content on screen closer to users and gave them the option to interact with their own hands - drawing and scribbling, making it personal. But we've always felt it wasn't the best Samsung could do in terms of hardware, offering a screen with an okay resolution and internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well this year things are about to change and improve. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is back with new tricks up its sleeve and a whole lot of improvements all round. The name, however, is somewhat of a head-scratcher - instead of going for something more elaborate like the Note 10.1 HD or something, Samsung decided to go all-Apple on consumers and dub this one the 2014 Edition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Anyway back to changes and improvements. The 2014 Edition Galaxy Note 10.1 comes with the same screen diagonal (at 10.1-inches), but pumps up the resolution from 1280 x 800 px with the modest ppi of 149 all the way up to 2560 x 1600 px with a resulting pixel density of around 299 pixels per inch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where there was plastic now there's a leather topping on the back panel. There are even contrasty stitches for a more realistic feel. The bezels around the screen have had some work done too and appear slimmer now. The S pen has been moved from the bottom to the upper-right corner, multi-window has been significantly improved and now allows two instances of the same app to be launched, which is very useful for browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has added Air Commands, which pop up when you take out the stylus and gives you options like action memo, which lets you write something down and then use it within a supported app (for instance writing a phone number can invoke the Phonebook app to save it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook is another improvement that can collect pretty much anything you have selected on screen into your own scrapbook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's S Search, which is a universal search that browses the tablet's memory for anything from words to numbers and even hand-drawn symbols. If you hover the S pen over a text field and the software is quick to react and give you the option to start writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S pen can now be used not only the screen but on the capacitive keys as well so it's fully functional in operating the tablet without you ever needing a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be a 32 and 64 GB versions of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition but being microSD-capable we don't see much sense in paying for the 64 gig option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition) hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition comes in two colors - black and white. Both feature a glass-covered font and a plastic back with a leather-like finish, which not only serves to add a bit of sophistication but also nicely enhances the grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate feels lighter than its predecessor and is more space-efficient. The bezels look like they've been trimmed as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edges appear sharper on the latest Note 10.1 and coupled with the aforementioned bezels give a more conservative, business-like allure to the package as a whole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is also thinner, which adds to its sophisticated look. Although Samsung hasn't altered the design thoroughly, we welcome the leather-like texture over the gloss and smudges-ridden plastic panels of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is easily the best we've seen on the market thus far. At 2560 x 1600 pixels it's far above FullHD resolution and with a diagonal of 10.1" it outputs a whopping 299 pixels per inch, meaning individual pixels can be discerned only if you try really hard, looking from really close up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Previously the stereo speakers were mounted on the front of the device, which worked slightly better when working with the display head on. Now Samsung has decided to move the speakers over to the sides, which doesn't appear to hurt the user experience all that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S pen has been moved as well. Previously resting on the bottom right corner of the Note 10.1 tablet, the S pen is now more intuitively-placed at the upper right corner so it's more easily accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white color option of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition struck us as the all-round better looking of the two. The silver plastic edges work more favorably with the white front and back panel and so do the silver accents like the camera lens and home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although more feminine in its general appearance, the white Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition can still be considered a unisex device, just a little more youthful in its demeanor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2014 Edition Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is much snappier than its predecessor and has a more refined build along with some logical and more intuitive design decisions. It's a step up from the Note 10.1 of old in every feasible way and probably the best tablet you can get in terms of multimedia delivery and sheer productivity prowess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite aiming to go head to head with an iPad that clearly has its focus elsewhere, the Galaxy Note 10.1 of 2014 Edition is a great choice for a slate in its own right.</paragraph>
