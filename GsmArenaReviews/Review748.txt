			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's cheapest LTE smartphone - that is the Xperia E3 key selling point, but is there more to it than that? With the same design language as the Sony Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact, the E3 looks well up-to-date and gives you the latest Android KitKat decked out in Sony team colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aiming for a low price point is always going to involve some corner cutting but, as Motorola's Moto G has shown, the overall experience doesn't necessarily need to be sub-par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can probably live with the not-too-slim bezels, but we won't put up with poor performance. Fortunately, the Snapdragon 400 inside the Xperia E3 has a good track record and the WVGA resolution shouldn't put too much strain on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go any further, let's check the Sony Xperia E3 review cheat sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 is an improvement over its predecessor in every way possible, which is probably why Sony chose to skip through E2 - the two digit improvement was needed to underline the big jump forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony prides itself on the battery performance of the Xperia E3, the company says it could go a full two days thanks to its 2,330mAh battery and STAMINA mode optimizations. We've yet to confirm that claim but it could potentially become a stand-out feature in a market where entry-level smartphones can barely make it through the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That, along with the premium design, the LTE radio and the exclusive built-in software should help the Xperia E3 withstand the pressure from 720p screen-packing competition. While clinging close to stock Android, the Xperia E3 has the custom Xperia UI with the What's New panel, TrackID, Album, Walkman, Movies and Xperia Themes, to name a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It isn't like us to deny a smartphone a fair hearing and the Xperia E3's trial begins after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 comes with a modest retail box featuring a rather low-power standalone A/C adapter (850mA) and a microUSB 2.0 cable. There were no headphones inside and that might be the case in many markets as Sony tries to keep the price down. As usual though retail package varies and you might be luckier than us.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia E3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 measures 137.1 x 69.4 x 8.5 mm, making it slightly slimmer, shorter and narrower than the 5" Motorola Moto G (2014) and much taller than the 4.5" Moto G of old. The weight is pretty heavy for the size at 143.8g, though, that adds a bit to the solid feel when you hold the handset in your hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Sony Xperia E3 is an interesting mixture of the Xperia M2 Aqua and the Xperia Z3 Compact. The front is unmistakable Sony with no physical buttons and a flat, clean look. We would've liked the bezels to be smaller, though as the poor screen to footprint ratio takes away quite a few points from the design score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main microphone and earpiece are hidden under speaker grilles which can easily be mistaken for the dual, stereo speakers on the latest Xperia Z3 Compact. We've only got a single speaker here, although that's hardly a surprise considering the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides go after the latest Xperia looks with rounded edges and rubbery corners that are there to absorb impacts should you drop the phone. However instead of the see-through plastic of the Xperia Z3 Compact or the steel of the Xperia Z3 the edges here are simply matte plastic with nice grip that enhances the feel. The back is where you'll see the matte back panel of the Xperia M2 Aqua with the exact same feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Sony Xperia E3 is a pleasure thanks to the matte surfaces front, sides and back. However it doesn't feel like a 4.5" device and more like a 4.8" one, that's due to the thicker bezels, which have made the body way taller than it needs to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note the device feels sturdy and solid, not fragile and bruise-prone. The curved edges fall nicely into place when the phone meets your palm and the matte surfaces ensure it will sit stubbornly in place. Smudges and fingerprints can be an issue on the front glass panel as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's phones are either glass on steel or matte plastic and while the Xperia E3 is of the latter variety that's still a good choice, giving a quality feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like the understated appearance of the all-black Xperia E3 you can go for one of three additional colors as well - White, Yellow and Copper.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony is clinging to its guns with the Xperia E3's button placement. If you've ever used an Xperia smartphone you should feel right at home with the Xperia E3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is occupied by the 4.5" 480x854px LCD of 218ppi. It's an IPS unit so the viewing angles are among the better in the class, but more on that a little later on. Under the display lies the main microphone, nestled into a small grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony logo above the display is flanked by the VGA front-facing camera and the proximity sensor. Above the logo under an identical grille as below is the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where you'll find the volume rocker and the power button. Adjusting the volume is a little tricky as the rocker is rather shallow and doesn't give out as much feedback as we'd like. The power button, on the other hand, is great and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth noting that Sony has skipped on the physical camera button, which we saw on the Xperia M2 Aqua. You can use the volume buttons to capture but there's no half press for focus lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Xperia E3 hosts only the microUSB 2.0 port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Xperia E3 has no controls whatsoever while the top is where the 3.5mm headphone jack is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is removable but only to allow access to the hot-swappable micro SIM and microSD card slots. The battery is still sealed-in so you can't swap it for another one. The SIM compartment handles microSIM cards and we found it very hard to empty. On one occasion it took us a duo of tools to release the SIM card from its slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera lens is on the top left of the Xperia E3's back. Alongside it there is a single LED flash and the second, noise-reducing microphone. There's an NFC indicator on the back showing where the point of contact is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main speaker is placed at the very bottom of the back panel, which isn't ideal. The Xperia E3's back is very flat, making the speaker easy to muffle when you put the device face up on a table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the non-ideal speaker placement and volume rocker the Xperia E3 boasts easily accessible controls. It's nice of Sony to include a removable back panel and hot-swappable microSD and SIM but it would have been even nicer if we could swap out the battery as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comes short on resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Sony Xperia E3 has a 4.5" diagonal and an IPS matrix but the resolution isn't too impressive. Sony has gone for a 480x854 pixel resolution that stretches a little thin for around 218 pixels per inch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While that number doesn't translate into superb sharpness, the display of the Xperia E3 isn't too bad for its class. Sure, the Moto G and a few others have it easily beaten, but WVGA and qHD screens are still very much the norm here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are good for the most part. There is some loss of contrast at some angles but colors remain the same. Speaking of colors, the Xperia E3 offers good, saturated colors on its LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement of the Xperia E3 is standard RGB with equally-sized green, red and blue pixels. Here it is under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Xperia E3 has okay blacks, about on par with its competition. Contrast was good and the screen can get very bright too making it an overall solid offering. The only area where it's lacking is the sharpness - at just 218 ppi things aren't as sharp as on the Moto G and Moto G (2014) displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the Xperia E3 display is okay and about the same as the upper Xperia Z2. It's certainly usable outdoors even if it's not the prettiest sight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 has a sealed 2,330mAh battery inside. We would've liked the option to swap it out for a spare since the back panel of the Xperia E3 is removable, but we will still be okay as long as it offers good enough battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's just what we got from the Sony Xperia E3, which managed to go on a charge for 75 hours or just over 3 days of use if you stick to our pattern of an hour of talking, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video watching per day. This means Sony's claim of 2 days is well justified as the Xperia E3 should last for 48h even if you use it fairly heavily (and particularly if you don't watch lots of video, which turned out to be its weak spot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out our detailed Xperia E3 battery life test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 comes in single and dual SIM flavors. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and either tri-band or quad- depending on the market. LTE is its key strength here and comes in quad-band penta-band and hexa-band options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS. There is also NFC connectivity with support for Android Beam for sending files to other Android devices. There's no IR port, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol handles connections to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port can also be used in On-the-go mode for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or real USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, but if you own a compatible HDTV, you can output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol or Sony's Xperia Connectivity Throw option. The app allows you to share your media through DLNA by creating a media server and connect to a PlayStation DUALSHOCK 3 wireless controller.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android KitKat with Xperia flavor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. The launcher looks identical to what you would see on any other KitKat Xperia smartphone, like the Xperia M2 Aqua we recently reviewed. If you aren't familiar with it, you can check out this quick video below to get you up to speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), while the rightmost pane will fire up the camera. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store. Also third party apps oftentimes come with their own set of extra widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five homescreen panels by default and you can set any of them as your primary one. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area lists notifications in the default tab with a separate tab for Quick Settings. You can gain quick access to the Quick Settings tab with a two-finger swipe from the top. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 20+ different toggles and have up to 12 of them visible in their dedicated page. Holding a finger over any toggle will give you direct access to its menu listing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E3 uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia E3 and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Touch Lock. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget. Sadly you can't disable the small apps entirely and will always have them cramming your recent apps whether you use them or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can access Google Now by swiping from the bottom of the UI. There's another shortcut right next to the Google Now launch key called What's new. This app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today, but it isn't limited to the Play Store only. It'll display content from Sony's PlayStation store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in 4GB of storage filled up pretty fast and the Xperia E3 needed a microSD card to help carry the load. And while we quickly obliged and moved the images, videos and other multimedia files over to the card apps were harder to move. You can transfer most of the built-in and all of the downloaded apps into the external memory but that would take you precious time and digging through the menus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance is par for the course<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 is built upon the familiar combination of a Snapdragon 400 chipset and 1GB of RAM. The processor inside is a quad-core Cortex-A7 that's clocked at 1.2GHz and there's an Adreno 305 handling the graphics. We did notice some issues here and there but nothing major. Loading of apps was snappy overall. On the other hand when we had many apps opened up the Xperia E3 would be left with some 140MB of RAM available, although we didn't notice too many slowdowns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dive into the synthetic tests - the Sony Xperia E3 didn't cheat on any of the test and showed identical scores in our anti-cheat tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always we'll start off with the CPU-focused and overall benchmarks we have on tap. GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 5 both place the Sony Xperia E3 in the middle of the table. The Motorola Moto G trio of devices (first-gen, LTE and second-gen) were slightly faster than the Xperia E3. In AnTuTu 5 the Xperia E3 got a slightly better result. The Xperia E3 even managed to post similar performance to the Xperia M2 Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II shows an overall score and breaks down performance by many factors. We choose to show the overall score and the single and multi-core one. Again we see average performance from the Xperia E3 and it only ever achieved higher results in the multi-core test.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 305 GPU inside the Xperia E3 managed pretty poor 1080p offscreen results in GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan tests, but it will actually never have to deal with such high resolutions. The onscreen results were okay and in line with its competition and even better on a few occassions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming benchmark Basemark X gives the Sony Xperia E3 a low score - half that of the Motorola Moto G. However, it needs to put less than half the pixels so actual gaming performance is bound to be on par.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 pulled off an okay effort in the JavaScript benchmark Kraken 1.1 and a very good (for its class) HTML5 score in BrowserMark 2.1. These benchmarks evaluate the browsing performance of the smartphone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 400 is showing its age but is still a good option for a smartphone in the midrange and particularly when it only needs to deal with an FWVGA screen. It handles tasks okay and conserves enough battery for it to not be an issue. You won't be able to enjoy FullHD gaming or superb CPU or browsing performance but you won't be left waiting forever either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xperia phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 was able to hold onto signal very well. We tested it even in tight spots and the bars dropped to only 3. Calls remained uninterrupted and the sound quality was okay. Voices came out loud enough. Clarity wasn't the best but it was okay nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3's loudspeaker was only average. It scored average voice and pink noise tests and a good ringing phone test so it shouldn't be an issue to hear calls. But no boomboxing with this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia E3 offers a customizable on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too, but only in portrait orientation. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We should all be familiar with Sony's custom gallery - Album. It organizes images into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same swipe-able menu the app drawer is offering. There you can find all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's also an FM Radio. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 audio output is quite similar to that of its more pricy stablemates. It managed some very good scores in our test, although its volume levels were far from impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone had spot-on frequency response, great dynamic range, excellent signal-to-noise ration and no distortion when used with an active external amplifier. Very solid performance with the sub-par volume levels the only thing to potentially frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes an average increase in stereo crosstalk and introduces some distortion. Frequency response also suffers a bit, but none of the three readings are too bad overall and quite easy to accept at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia E3 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 was able to handle videos up to 1080p resolution. It had issues with the AC-3 audio codec and failed to load sound in videos carrying it but that's mostly normal for smartphones these days. MKV movies didn't play at all along with FLV and some AVI files (most played fine). The most popular DivX and XviD played just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lacks subtitle support by default but offers a built-in movie editor that will let you trim videos and adjust speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera is nothing worth writing home about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 has a modest 5MP camera on the back accompanied by a single LED flash. The video capture stands at 1080p at 30fps - nothing to get overly excited about but also nothing to be ashamed of. In fact the Moto G only manages 720p video recording, so the Xperia E3 has the upper hand here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes most of the time. In some shooting modes, though, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full resolution Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children might love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creative effects features a number of effects that you can apply to images. Each effect is showcased in real time so you can see it in action before you press the shutter. There are 17 effects in total among which are Comic, Kaleidoscope, Harris shutter, Comic, Fisheye and Mosaic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social live lets you share a live feed over Facebook, Timeshift burst captures a burst of photos and starts even before you're pressed the shutter and finally Sweep Panorama. You can also download additional camera apps from Sony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 might have an ample software package but it's hardly the most impressive around in terms of quality. Images captured with its 5MP shooter have only average amount of detail, but at least noise is kept under control and there are no sharpening halos. We did notice a lot of soft patches on many of the images suggesting less than perfect lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are okay if a bit dull and the exposure was mostly spot on, but the dynamic range is very limited. The Xperia E3 was quick to focus and capture images, at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro samples do better in terms of detail - the lens issues aren't visible when the focus is set to so close. However, the phone is unable to go very close to the subject and you can really capture really fine detail or achieve significant background blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E3 offers an HDR mode in which it aims to expose the scene's shadows better and not allow the highlight to clip. While Superior Auto would occasionally activate it, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode. The shooting mode brings back a fair amount of shadow detail back, but really ruins the contrast of the shots and the final result is barely usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama samples weren't impressive either. The Sweep panorama software was able to stitch the different images into an up to 5MP image - hardly great resolution and while its per-pixel detail isn't too bad, the limited dynamic range is an even more obvious issue here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can check out our photo quality comparison tool for more pixel peeping. Sadly the flawed camera performance of the Sony Xperia E3 is magnified in the charts we have in the tool as they showcase the resolving abilities of the sensor as well as how it deals with color rendition and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video is better than what competitors over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the grand scheme of the Xperia E3 the still shots do better in their own 5MP league than the 1080p videos compare to their peers. Videos look very poor for FullHD and actually appear more akin to 720p (or perhaps even lower) upscaled to 1080p. Then again given that most of the competition does 720p clips (and not very good ones at that), it's not all bad for the Xperia E3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detail is scarce and there are blotches and artifacts all over the scene of the videos. The framerate is a less than perfectly smooth, fluctating between 24fps and 22-23fps at any given moment during recording. This results in a somewhat choppy video at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the bitrate is high for the result you're getting - 21Mbps. Perhaps the Sony Xperia E3 unit we have for review has issues with its optics that won't be present on all units. Still take a look at a sample below and consider yourselves warned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a 1080p@24fps sample directly from the Sony Xperia E3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Chrome to phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's Smart Connect app comes pre-installed - it allows you to set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or during a time interval (e.g. mute alarms at night). It doesn't work with NFC tags though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Select does the same as the Sony's What's New app, but comes with much less functions and old UI. We feel Sony should retire it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 comes with Track ID TV and it will recognize a TV show if you point the device to listen to what you're watching - neat. It also features the Office Suite 8, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available by default. Interestingly there's no Notes app preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the Sony PlayStation app too, which allows you to browse your PlayStation profile, avatar and achievements. It's far from Microsoft default Xbox app on Windows Phone, but it's something. It can also connect to your PS4 and extract various content from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E3 wants to make a splash but not rock the boat of Sony's other midrangers. Now, that sounds like a tough brief but the Xperia E3 might just have enough to get noticed in the crowded mid-range market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bang for buck is key here and the most affordable Xperia of this generation offers plenty of it. The sub-720p screen counts against, but it readily over-delivers in other departments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life is arguably its most potent weapon - the Xperia E3 can easily outlast most of its rivals and by a very comfortable margin too. LTE and the exclusive Sony apps work in its favor, the solid build earning it some extra points. Unfortunately, the camera is no better than we are used to - despite the generous promises on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the quick sum-up of our in-house tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the market gets busier with hardware from nearly every manufacturer it needs to be said the Xperia E3 certainly faces a tough battle. Some of its main rivals come from within the battle ranks in the face of the Sony Xperia M2, M2 Aqua and Xperia SP. The latter is the oldest of the three but comes with a bigger 720p display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 and M2 Aqua outclass the Xperia E3 in screen size, processing power, camera and the Aqua can even go underwater. All three cost more than the Xperia E3, so you can only consider them if you feel like addressing a particular issue while staying in Sony's camp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia M2 ? Sony Xperia M2 Aqua ? Sony Xperia SP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The midrange space has mostly been ruled by Motorola in the past year. This year sees the company unleash a 5" 720p Moto G (2014) with a microSD card and the latest Android experience for a little more cash than the Xperia E3. And if that cash seems too much for you, the 1-year-old Moto G (2013) will cost you around the same as an Xperia E3 - the lack of LTE and microSD card slot make that one a hard recommendation for many though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola Moto G (2014) ? Motorola Moto G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy Core II costs the same as the Xperia E3 but doesn't really outshine it in any way. It's there for you if you want a smaller device with the same display size and prefer TouchWiz over Xperia UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Core II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're willing to consider other platforms, there's always the Nokia Lumia 635. It matches the Sony Xperia E3 spec for spec but costs less and offers Microsoft's Windows Phone with its cool live tiles, but somewhat more limited app selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 635</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also has its candidates to ruin the Xperia E3's day. The Desire 510 has a slightly bigger screen of the same resolution, more built-in storage space and HTC's Sense UI for a little more money. The Desire 516 has Dual-SIM support and opts for a bigger 5.0" display of a higher resolution but omits the 1080p video recording. At least it costs around the same as an Xperia E3. Getting a Jelly Bean smartphone in this price range means having to deal with more performance issues though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire 510 ? HTC Desire 516 dual sim</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Decisions, decisions - picking an entry-level smartphone has never been this hard. But it is for all the right reasons - instead of going for the lesser evil, you can now carefully choose the one that suits your usage and needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you do lots of reading or image browsing you might want to get a 720p screen. If WVGA does it for you, the Sony Xperia E3 can easily be at the top of your shortlist.</paragraph>
