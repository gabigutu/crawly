			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile version of Samsung Galaxy S II is has taken a sharp departure from its GSM siblings. Compared to the original I9100, the droid has grown in size considerably. Its face has changed as well, putting it in line with the U.S. lineup of Samsung smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see a better Android smartphone than the original Samsung Galaxy S II this year. The device took the Android community by storm with a combination of slim looks, powerful hardware, and mind-blowing performance. The AT&amp;T version of the powerful droid kept the winning formula almost intact and will surely contribute significantly to the 10 million units of Galaxy S II that have been sold already. The T-Mobile version brings some different features to the mix, which differentiates it a lot from its siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brief look at the spec sheet of the T-Mobile Galaxy S II will make you raise an eyebrow. Samsung has replaced the monstrously fast Exynos chipset with a new one, made by Qualcomm. The Snapdragon S3 chipset has two cores, clocked at 1.5GHz. The GPU is Adreno 220. The changes in the chipset allow the Galaxy S II for T-Mobile to reach network speeds of up to 42Mbps. Not too shabby then, we think. The gorgeous Super AMOLED Plus screen has also grown to the massive 4.52? in size, promising even more candy than the rest of the Galaxy S II lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, has the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile stuck to its pedigree of droid powerhouses, or has its new chipset softened it up? Read on to find out. As always, we?ll kick it off with the key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Logically, the new chipset is the big question mark in the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile. The bigger screen is a welcome addition to the feature set, along with the freshened up design. The rest of the droid comes straight from the I9100 parts bin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, there are enough changes in the smartphone to get us seriously curious about its performance. We will continue with unboxing and a hardware inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An almost complete retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the T-Mobile Galaxy S II retail box, you will find a nice looking wall charger, a USB cable, an MHL adapter, as well as a pair of high quality headphones from Samsung. The usual T-Mobile booklets, along with the handset, complete the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card is notably missing from the droid?s retail box. We attribute this to the 16 gigs worth of built-in storage which the Galaxy S II has.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a bigger screen on board, it was only logical that the T-Mobile Galaxy S II has grown in measures as well. It is definitely a device with a lot of presence. Thankfully, the gain is not that drastic, compared to the rest of the Galaxy S II lineup. With 131 x 70 x 9 mm, and 135 grams of weight, the droid still qualifies as being quite pocket friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of size and measurements, the T-Mobile Galaxy S II sits right in the middle of the U.S. lineup. It is a tad smaller than the Sprint Wireless version, despite having the same screen size, and quite bigger than the AT&amp;T Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the smartphone is made from pleasant, soft feel with a very fine texture ? a sharp departure from the plastic used in the rest of the Galaxy S II lineup. There is a nice metal bezel encircling the device, while the front is all about Corning Gorilla Glass in terms of material used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can describe you the 4.52? Super AMOLED Plus screen of the droid with only one word ? gorgeous. We are yet to see a better screen on a mobile device. Despite the fact that there are screens with higher resolution out there, yet none of the them comes even close to the Super AMOLED Plus of the Galaxy S II. It simply wows you every time you turn it on. You can find out more about the technology behind the Super AMOLED Plus screens here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the large screen, you will find four touch-sensitive buttons ? just like in the rest of the U.S. lineup of Galaxy S II devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the 2MP front-facing camera unit are located in the area above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile features the volume rocker. The volume keys double as zoom lever in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, there is no dedicated camera button on the right side of the smartphone. We believe that a camera unit this capable surely deserves one, as the virtual shutter key is far from perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is a 3.5mm audio jack on the top of the device. In addition to it, you will find a second microphone which is used for active noise cancelling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with MHL enabling HDTV-out connectivity with the proper adapter. The mouthpiece completes the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MHL is a way of using both microUSB and HDMI through the same port. It makes sense, especially provided an HDMI port could?ve been near impossible to put in a phone this slim. The downside is you need an adapter to use a regular HDMI cable with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Galaxy S II is where the 8 megapixel Full HD-capable camera lens is located. Right under it is the LED flash, which will probably see more use a flashlight and video-light than a still-camera assist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grille is also on the back of the device. It is located on the slightly elevated chin at the bottom. The chin is not as pronounced as in the rest of the Galaxy S II GSM lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the paper thin battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the 1850 mAh battery and the microSD card slot. The card slot can take microSD cards of up to 32GB, which can give you a maximum total storage of 48GB. Interestingly enough, both the SIM and microSD cards are hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1850 mAh battery made it easily through a day of heavy usage which included about an hour of web browsing, an hour of phone calls, as well as a serious amount of video game play. Lasting for two full days is a bit of a stretch if you are a smartphone junkie like us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the T-Mobile Galaxy S II feels nice. The textured plastic on the back prevents accidental drops, while the premium materials used in the rest of the device make it known to everyone that you are holding a serious piece of smartphone goodness.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: TouchWiz-ed Android Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile Galaxy S II runs Android?s latest 2.3.5 Gingerbread, dressed in Samsung?s own TouchWiz UI. The latter has proven to be quite capable and nicely looking. See it on video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes in TouchWiz 4.0, compared to its previous versions (say, if you?re coming from the Samsung Vibrant), begin at the very lock screen, which you can now remove by swiping in any direction, rather than just sideways. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is still here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen got plenty of tweaks too. You get rectangular design for the widgets and a lot of functionality. The process of adding widgets is visually enhanced too with attractive transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregated view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the proprietary Samsung widgets allow you to edit them directly on the homescreen. We find this feature to be really neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is improved as well. You can now create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here). Different view types are available for you to choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange the app panels within the launcher in a similar fashion as the homescreen ones. A pinch gesture lays them out in front you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. With 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications straight on your homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks leave us wondering<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon S3 chipset of the T-Mobile Galaxy S II is a sharp departure from the beast which the Exynos is well known to be. With two Scorpion cores, clocked at 1.5GHz, the Snapdragon surely is no slouch. It does however go a bit easier on the benchmarks than its Exynos packing siblings. We have put together several for you. See them below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the results above, the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile is certainly one quite capable droid. It didn?t however prove it as assertively as the I9100 and the Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we mentioned that we were left with a mixed feeling after putting the droid through the synthetic benchmarks. Its Vellamo benchmark score was the main reason for it. The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile scored higher than any device we have tried before. It beat the rest of its Galaxy S II siblings by quite a margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping in mind that synthetic benchmarks have little to do with the way you will use your smartphone every day, we can attest that the Galaxy S II did show a miniscule amount of lag, compared to the rest of the Galaxy S II siblings. It is however, faster than anything else on the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is great as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the original Galaxy S. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it, deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too. If you don?t need that, you can still opt for the phonebook to augment your existing contacts info with stuff downloaded from the social network cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is a charm, so are the voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls. The superb T-Mobile coverage in New York City?s area contributed to this fact as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available ? a double tap on the Home key activates voice commands. All you need to say is ?Hi Galaxy? and speak your command (e.g. ?text Dexter?). Or ?play? and off it goes. It takes a second to launch voice commands but the coolness factor makes it well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s worth noting that this is a third-party app and not the standard Google service ? it?s actually better than what regular Android has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype. Both virtual QWERTYs have proven to be easy to use. More options can be found in the Android Market. The large screen of the T-Mobile Galaxy S II makes text entry even easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browsers are at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and as soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an image editor as well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor preinstalled. The image editor handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It?s not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill ? similar to Photoshop?s Context-aware fill tool but, again, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly enough, the Video Editor, which we became used to seeing in the other versions of Samsung Galaxy S II is missing in the T-Mobile version. We have no logical explanation why.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is capable as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (adjust them back or forth a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera is as impressive as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy S II offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too; we?re only listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Galaxy S II are very good ? low noise, plenty of fine detail and the color and contrast are good too. Colors are a smidge oversaturated but that?s how we like them. Keep in mind that the camera has a wide-angle lens ? our measurements suggest a focal length of about 30mm in 35mm equivalent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For comparison photos between the Galaxy S II, Sony Ericsson Arc and LG Optimus 2X you can check out our recent Head-to-head article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video recording is on board as expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Full HD videos are top-notch, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There?s plenty of information (bitrate is over 17Mbps) and the only drawback you might consider is the mono audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The annoying pre-focusing in the start of each video that gets captured in the footage is now gone with the T-Mobile version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiarity is that when shooting Full HD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. Perhaps Samsung are using the same trick as Apple in the iPhone 4: the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and having to scale it down to 1080p putting extra strain on the CPU. In 720p video capture mode however Samsung are making use of the whole sensor and as a result you have the same wide field of view as the still camera (about 30mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually benefits the suppression of digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a support for your hand while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S II Full HD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is smooth though a bit slow at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with 17Mbps bitrate and have a lot of detail. The framerate is quite consistent ? there are no dropped or duplicated frames. Keep in mind that Full HD videos gobble up a lot of storage ? a minute of video will easily top 100MB of file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nice and smooth too, but obviously short of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few videos Samsung Galaxy S II for you to enjoy. The last one was shot in 720p resolution, while the first one is in 1080p (don?t forget to select 1080p mode when playing it and certainly open it full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is abundant with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G. There?s HSPA+ with 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s technically not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility ? yup, it?s a dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity. Wi-Fi hotspot is also at your disposal with support of up to 8 devices. This is an area where the zippy T-Mobile network will also come handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also NFC support too. We have the strange suspicion that the NFC chip might be integrated into the battery as it carries the NFC sign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the rest of the Galaxy S II lineup, the NFC on the T-Mobile version is fully functional right out of the box. There is a pre-installed app, called Tags, which utilizes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There one is included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy S II screen will be mirrored on the TV. You can check out this post to see MHL on video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes using it a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful dual-core CPU enables the Galaxy S II browser to play 1080p Flash video embedded on webpages. That was truly impressive stuff ? a lot of netbooks would choke on something like that. You can play touch-optimized Flash games without a hitch too. We did however a slight hint of choppiness during the video playback. This will be an area where the Exynos chipset will be missed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There are a couple of Samsung Hubs preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Hub lets you buy or rent movies or TV shows. Its interface is neat and intuitive, while its setup will take you no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile comes with the Polaris Office preinstalled, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess ? it?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer as well. The app allows you to search for your office files just like with a file explorer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer is flawless<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps is essential<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and a powerful GPU, the Galaxy S II for T-Mobile can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.5 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also book, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must note that, in the case of the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy II, the wireless provider has gone out of its way in putting all kinds of proprietary apps, whose usability hovers around the absolute zero. Having them on board clutters the phone?s launcher and takes away from its resources for no good reason.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air turns your phone into a web server<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You?ll need a reasonably modern browser with Java and some video plug-in (QuickTime worked for us).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile is priced at $229.99 after a $50 mail-in-rebate. Of course, you will also need a two-year contract with the magenta colored wireless provider in order to qualify for the above price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the original Galaxy S II was launched almost six months ago, it enjoyed the luxury of barely having any competition. It trounced everything compared to it and for a good reason ? the Exynos chipset was simply faster than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Snapdragon S3 under the hood, the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II is not as assertive in its performance as the rest of the GSM sporting, Galaxy S II lineup. It does however, more than make up for the notable omission by offering you zippy network speed, a mammoth battery, and a bigger Super AMOLED Plus screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Metaphorically speaking, you can get a lot of smartphone for hard earned $200 today. Let?s see what the most notable options out there are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, we will begin with the Samsung offerings. The Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T and the CDMA flavored Samsung Epic 4G Touch for Sprint are both priced at $199.99. The droids will entice you with Exynos CPU and lower price tag. Sprint?s service plans also offer unlimited data, which is worthy for a phone this capable. Samsung surely won?t mind if you choose any of these two over the T-Mobile Galaxy S II.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Apple?s latest and greatest iPhone 4S is also an option, should you decide that Android is not your cup of tea. Despite being evolutionary, rather than revolutionary product, the smartphone is already selling like hot cakes. With $199.99 out of your pocket, you can join the Apple frenzy as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you look within T-Mobile?s own ranks, you will find three powerful droid options to a Galaxy S II. The HTC Amaze 4G leads the pack. It has the same chipset as the Galaxy S II, and a higher resolution screen. The latter however, cannot hold a candle to Samsung?s Super AMOLED Plus unit. The $259.99 price tag of the droid is also higher.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation 4G and the T-Mobile G2X (LG Optimus 2) are also worth your consideration as their price is expected to drop even further now that the new crop of power droids is out.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In case you want to go down the CDMA road, check out Sprint?s HTC EVO 3D, the Motorola Photon 4G, as well as the Motorola Droid Bionic from Verizon Wireless. The first two will offer you WiMax connectivity and solid performance for $199.99. The Droid Bionic on the other hand, sports LTE on board, but a much higher price tag of $299.99.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As you can see, there are plenty of options out there. None of them however, will offer you the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II screen size, or performance for that matter. It can still be bested only by another Galaxy S II. You know, only a ninja can kill another ninja. It?s good times for Samsung ahead then, regardless which carrier you go for.</paragraph>
