			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Good build, QWERTY keyboard and one-touch access to music: the Nokia X2-01 has the right ingredients to serve and entertain. And if you?re looking to buy cheap, it?s an offer that?s hard to beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has long made the low-end their fortress and X2-01 must be following a strategy that?s proven to work. The Nokia X2-01 is a music phone for the young with emphasis on Facebook and messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its combination of features and form factor versus price, the Nokia X2-01 has a market segment of its own. It?s another foot soldier in Nokia?s offensive in Here are the highs and lows of the X2-01 in a nutshell."becoming the world?s number one QWERTY phone manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are ready to turn a blind eye to some of the disadvantages. 3G is not essential in this price range and so is a decent camera. The S40 is not the best-looking feature phone interface but it would?ve been a lot easier to live with if it had smart dial, some document viewer capabilities or basic multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cost-cutting is key for the X2-01. Nokia obviously presumes the target audience doesn?t really need those things. The X2-01 is all about simplicity and ease of use plus some great build quality. This entry-level messenger will not be bothered by comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t hesitate to follow us along as we check up the exterior and internals of the X2-01 ? we?re about to find out exactly what you?re getting for your hard earned cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: Normally, phones like the X2-01 stay under our review radar as they rarely excite much interest in our readers. However, the Nokia X2-01 is special. Its Daily Interest rating has hit 35% at the time of writing this. That?s an impressive number for a low-end handset ? it equals the daily interest rating of the Google Nexus S and the Motorola DEFY combined. Obviously Nokia X2-01 has somehow managed to attract our visitors? attention.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing, design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-01 comes in a plain cardboard box. Other than the phone itself, you?ll get the typical basic accessories: a charger and the good old one-piece handsfree that ends on a 3.5mm audio jack. There is no USB cable or microSD card enclosed in an attempt to keep the price down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-01 is only the second QWERTY messenger feature phone by Nokia after the C3. The first thing to note is an obvious return to the XpressMusic styling. It feels the phone could?ve been more compact ? though we wouldn?t call it too big or cumbersome. The QWERTY messenger stands at 119.4 x 59.8 x 14.3 mm. The all-plastic handset weighs 113 grams and it is perfectly balanced for both single and two-handed use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the X2-01 could?ve been slimmer, it seems designed to perfectly fit in your hand. The curved back (taking after the Sony Ericsson?s human curvature as seen in the Aspen) feels nice and secure in hand even though the plastic surface doesn?t allow a good enough grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row keyboard and the 2.4" landscape QVGA display take up almost the entire front of the handset. The screen has decent contrast and commendable sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A spacious navigation deck provides plenty of room for controls arranged around a trademark D-pad. At the outer ends, the Call and End knobs share a flatbed with the soft keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In between are the dedicated Music and the Messaging key, which can be assigned a different function each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All controls are decently sized and quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row QWERTY keypad has well defined and reasonably sized keys to rival the excellent typing skills of the E series smartphones. The nicely convex keys are tactile and big enough. The backlighting is impressively sharp and solid ? better than on the E71 and the same as on the C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find various connectivity ports and slots on the X2-01. The microSD slot and the microUSB port are covered by a common rubber lid on the phone?s left side. The two apertures are harder to access but perhaps better protected against dust and moisture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exposed 3.5mm audio jack and the charger plug are up top. There is no volume rocker, nor a dedicated camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In honesty though, the camera resolution should be the first thing to worry about. Usually the phones we review use VGA cameras as secondary imaging devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside are the massive hole of the miserable VGA camera lens and the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover lies a 1020 mAh battery that can easily give you more than three days of use considering there?s nothing much to drain power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X2-01 price tag is a good enough excuse for the missing functionality but the good thing is there?s been no compromise with the build quality. We can?t complain with ergonomics either ? navigation and typing are excellent. There?s a side-mounted memory card slot and a 3.5 mm audio jack ? not bad at all for an entry level phone. The good screen sunlight legibility and the great keyboard backlighting are not to be underrated either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S40 UI and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The X2-01 runs on the same Nokia?s Series 40 user interface as the Nokia C3, which we reviewed earlier. It?s been styled to look a lot like Symbian S60 3rd ? which is to say it?s trying to look above its pay grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia S40 UI is simple and easy, fast and responsive. The useful Active standby mode (the live shortcuts on the homescreen mode) is an asset but there is no multi-tasking and you have very limited choice of third party apps. Another thing to consider is the lack of smart dialing ? some of the competing feature phones have had this feature for a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X2-01?s phonebook brings no surprises. It stores up to 2000 contacts, each one with up to 5 phone numbers ? basically this should be enough for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We made a few calls on the X2-01 and had no problems. The in-call quality is good as in most S40 phones, despite the lack of the Nokia proprietary Voice Clarity feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record a running call if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from our loudspeaker test are at your disposal - Nokia X2-01 turned out to be an average performer. Check out the table showing how it stacks up beside some of the handsets we've put to the same test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-01 feels right at home when it comes to messaging. The phone is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s social networking and IMs ? Facebook, Twitter and Ovi Chat are natively supported on the Nokia X2-01. The social stuff is handled by the Communities app (Facebook and Twitter support), which has a dedicated slot on the active standby homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing is a breeze on the Nokia X2-01?s full keyboard. The interface is very familiar and you won?t need much time to find your way around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The multimedia department has never been in the limelight on S40. The recently added new gallery app ? Photos ? is preinstalled on the X2-01, so managing your image files is hassle-free. You can still find the old Gallery app hidden in the Application menu, which also doubles as a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn?t expect miracles from the music and video players either. The Music app hardly looks the part, but the audio codec support saves the day: AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB are among the supported file formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the 3.5mm audio jack you?re not stuck with the poor prebundled headset and can use your favorite headphones instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio works fine, using the cable headset as antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All the readings of the Nokia X2-01 are great if you use it as an audio source for an external amplifier (a car or home stereo). When you plug in the headphones, the intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk suffer, but the overall result still remains good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X2-01 frequency response graph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is quite limited as usual, able to playing only some low-res mp4 and 3gp videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at the camera. It?s only a VGA unit with support for QVGA videos @ 24fps. The interface is quite basic, with very few settings available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few camera samples. We're not really going to comment those as they are as bad as they get. We publish those just for reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a QVGA@24fps video sample by the Nokia X2-01.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing and organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-01 can do the job although it will definitely not be your first-choice device for web browsing. Speed is limited to EDGE and the small low-res screen doesn?t help much either. But, hey nobody expected exceptional skills here. But even if someone did ? nobody is being charged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default browser on the Nokia X2-01 is the Opera Mini 4.2. It?s long been standard issue web browser on S40 phones. The Opera Mini browser supports multiple tabs and the compression notably improves loading time and saves on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia X2-01 is our last stop. It?s as elaborate as on more advanced S40 phones. You get the full package with a large number of time management applications with a user-friendly interface. All the basics are covered ? calendar, alarm, stopwatch, calculator, unit converter, notes, voice recorder, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright, we have to be fair. The Nokia X2-01 made it all so easy for us ? it was a quick in and out. Now, obviously there?s a lot of things missing but it would be wrong to say it?s all for the sake of being cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Features were left out entirely on purpose ? the ones left were picked so carefully that the X2-01 ended up without any direct competitors. Adding even the most basic of features will turn the X2-01 into a completely different phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Add a 2-megapixel camera for an LG GW300, or WLAN for a Nokia C3, pick dual SIM for a Samsung Ch@t, or 3G for a Nokia E5. You can go all the way up from the Nokia X2-01 but never down. This doesn?t quite pass as a compliment but one thing you can?t take from the X2-01 ? it?s unique.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GW300 ? Nokia C3 ? Samsung Ch@t 322 ? Nokia E5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, the Nokia X2-01 will only be available on select markets via authorized Nokia stores or carriers. But it?s a phone you can easily snatch off the Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do, you?ll be getting an entry-level messenger which is probably worth every penny you paid. A decent screen and an awesome keyboard, social skills and messaging and a music package complete with a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot. For the right user, the Nokia X2-01 is the perfect package at the perfect price ? about 75 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X2-01 is bottom of the food chain and proud of it. The right attitude will pay off.</paragraph>
