			<paragraph>Samsung D600 is a mobile phone with a brilliant display, 2 megapixel camera, memory card and a lot of functions. It will win you over with its stereo sound and the many possibilities for TV connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key features<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The actual phone used in this review is Samsung D600E - it is the same as the Samsung D600, but it supports EDGE and it is tri-band, not quad-band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung D600 is one of the most featured mobile phones without operating system. Only strong competitors like Sony Ericsson K750 or Nokia 6230i can be compared with its features and functions. In such comparison it wins with its extremely fancy design; in addition, it wins also with the stereophonic output for Bluetooth or the output for composite video signal. Yes, you can connect this phone to a normal TV with the help of supplied cable without any problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung D600E</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This model reminds of the older Samsugn D500, which is still successfully sold at a very good price. The new model inherited from it the whole design conception. It has the same weight and a body with dimensions of 96 × 47 × 22 mm; therefore it's a millimeter wider, but a milliliter thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The phone is very user friendly ? the sliding mechanism is good and solid </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>In dark vesture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D600 is a device with sliding construction. This form factor significantly increased its market share in the last year or two. In comparison to the clamshells, the sliders offer an easier and more comfortable way of operating while the advantages are one and the same - a possibility to use big display and comfortable keypad in a small phone. The design is eye-catching, but on the other side there's nothing shocking in the appearance, because it is almost the same as its successful forerunner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Do you like it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front part consists of a big display, which is embedded under dark protecting glass. When the phone is off they form a black area. A silver fillet highlights the slot for headphones above the display; under it - the engraved name of the manufacturer in a silver field. It divides a part of the display from the functional keys and serves like a finger stopper when sliding due to the soft appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   You'll find some refreshing elements on the gloomy front side ? the headphones, for example ? or under the display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functional keys are five and together with the pair of soft keys under the display they control the calls; here is also the correction C button. All these keys are situated around a four-way cursor button which has also a confirming centre. You won't find another buttons on the front part of the phone; on the right side of the phone there is only a camera button; on the opposite side is a couple of buttons for volume regulation and other functions - phonebook search, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Function part of the keyboard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I must commend the perfect covering of all openings. A slot for TransFlash memory card in the lower part of the left side, a compound system connector in the lower side or an audiovisual connector in the upper part of the right side - all are protected by sophisticated plastic caps. The attachment to the phone prevents from their loss; they don't affect the exterior line at all when the phone is closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   All connectors are protected by plugs, which you won't lose </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you look carefully trough the area of the upper edges of the phone, I am sure you won't miss the four small openings on each one of them. Yes, you guessed right, these are covered stereophonic speakers grates. We can admit even now the fact that the tested Samsung D600 has a superb sound and outdistances a little in such a way. You may catch sight of an eyelet for a strap on the upper side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The sound speakers are on the both sides </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper part of the back side we see a 2 megapixel camera lens in silver background, supplemented by a LED flash at one side and by a convex mirror for easier self portrait on the other. The battery is straight and directly a part of the backside of the phone, so it doesn't show a slightest tendency towards creak even at very strong pressure. The whole backside of the phone is as though rubber and due to this fact Samsung lays chained to the desk even during vibration. The soft surface doesn't allow fingerprints. The battery is lithium-ion and with its capacity of 850 mAh can supply the phone up to 12 days standby, 7 hours talk time. It depends on the usage. It lasts a week when you don't use it much. You may charge it every day after very active usage. The charging lasts about two hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>After sliding the upper part of the phone upwards we can see a black and by the way very good keyboard. The keys are big enough even for rough fingers and are slightly embedded under the edge of the surrounding casing. They are very well distinguishable by touch. The key stroke is optimal, the buttons are very stable. Due to this you can type fast and easy without making mistakes even in a longer text - an email, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph> The lightening of the keyboard is white</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Where did those colors come from?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want to impress your friends or colleagues who show off with the color displays of their phones, show them the display of Samsung D600. The display is active, of course and perfectly demonstrates everything the TFT technology is capable of. There are 76 800 pixels (in matrix of 240 × 320), on an area of 3 × 4 centimeters; the display can show up to 262K colors. It can fit from 6 to 11 text lines in different work modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is really good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of this device is really unmatched and the quality of the picture is marvelous. Due to the relatively big resolution on a sufficient area the separate pixels are small enough without apparent black bordersand; the displayed graphics look very natural. The diagonal lines aren't jaggy at all; in fact perfect is not only the refresh rate of the displayed information, but the even lightening, too. Consequently, we may even believe that every pixel on the display is backlighted by its own diode, like in the professional LCD monitors. So, in a direct sunlight the display of the tested phone is very readable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Menu and control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pushing the left context key takes you to the main menu and pressing the confirming centre in standby mode connects you to WAP. You may set any direction of the cursor button to enter the menu. The main phone menu is matrix; 9 well arranged graphic icons are displayed in two modes. The currently selected icon is bigger and fluently animated. There are two modes of the main menu: the classic icon one, which is well known and a "Flash" mode in which the icons seem to be moving and scaling chaotically, just like in a Flash animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The main display with different wallpapers ? main icon menu ? example of component text menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may use the numeric key shortcuts to navigate the menu. The other levels of the menu are text-based and don't differ from the menu of the other Samsung models. Operating is intuitive and doesn't divert much from the rules, so the experience with the phone will be fast and pleasant for most of the regular users. Only the habit to use items in some sections, which require horizontal movement may embarrass sometimes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Example of the main menu in Flash mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can personalize the phone background to your taste by color themes, personal wallpaper (incl. animated), the level of display illumination, the style of text displayed or the image of the calendar of the current month directly onto the opening screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   There are many options for personalization - from color menu themes to selection the color of the letters and the image background writing numbers </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The dream of the mobile audiophile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I must again commend Samsung, this time for the very clear sound during calls. The voice is flat and glass clear with slightly more distinct bass element. The handsfree sound is also pleasantly round and the MP3 sound will surprise you pleasantly (it supports also AAC and AAC+). While playing a track with sufficient bitrate you won' believe your own ears that this pleasant and full sound is coming from a mobile phone. The volume is more than sufficient and the quality of the sound doesn't drop much even at maximum. You may adjust the quality of the sound with the help of an equalizer or by 3D effect activation. This is suitable for the loudspeakers, the sound of the headphones, however distorts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Believe it or not, the music triumph of the phone doesn't end here - you may listen to your favorite tracks in a more discrete way through the added stereo wire headphones set, you may connect also stereo Bluetooth headphones. For example, Ovislink BT-120HP20HP are such headphones, the phone didn't have any problems with. The music is playing and there are no wires to disturb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music files can be stored either on the extension memory card or in the internal shared memory of 75 MB. The player supplements the sound by visualization on the display. Most of the users, however would appreciate the option to minimize it in order to work easy with the phone. You have to arrange your favorite tracks in playlists. There is an option for change the volume at locked keypad with the help of the side buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    MP3 player with different visualizations ? context menu of the player ? sound setting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Albums or play lists creation ? selecting pieces into play lists ? you may play video records, too </paragraph>

			<paragraph>The ringtones supported are MP3 and 40-channel polyphonic melodies; vibration is available. Samsung, however is continuing to ignore the function of ringtone profiles. The phone alerts work in two modes - you may switch from one to another trough the navigation key - loud style or silent and vibe. You may differentiate single calling persons or their groups by specific ringtones, and also assign to them personal images or pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook search ? inserting/editing contacts ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may insert up to 1000 contacts in the internal multi-item list (11 items to every contact). The phone shows the internal phonebook together with the one on the SIM; you may search items by writing the letters of the searched contact one by one. The search is speed is good even when working with many contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   You may send a message directly from the phonebook ? calls list</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages in all directions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D600 works with text messages, of course. Up to 200 messages can be stored in the memory. Delivery reports are available; even the countdown of characters doesn't surprise. Available is also information about the number of messages with common size, necessary for sending of one long message, which may consist of 12 pieces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS are just obligatory for photo mobiles of the highest class. MMS Editor is well-arranged and in most cases is similar to the one we know from the background of the personal computers. The editor literally will bring you to the composition of the messages in one unit, which you then may send or store in the internal shared memory. The maximum size of one MMS is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Message menu ? writing text messages ? MMS messages creation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in Samsung D600 is good. You may work with email trough five accounts, protocols POP3 and IMAP are at disposal. They however don't provide the necessary level of security, required nowadays; that's why I was excited about the protected SecureIMAP protocol, without it I couldn't enter my mailbox via the phone. The phone can show directly many types of attachments. You may open directly in the phone pictures, DOC files, XLS and others supported by PicSel browser. There are no problems with the classic ISO-8859-2 and UTF8. There is an integrated anti spam filter (it functions only in the principle of black list and white list); relatively surprising are the restrictions of the message to the poor 200 KB. So, you don't have a chance to send a picture with 2 megapixel resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two megapixel portrait<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may read a full and detailed review of the Samsung D600 camera camera in a separate article, which is focused not only on the picture quality, but on their creation and possibilities of modification. Here we propose some sample pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>           </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The biggest display in the world?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The option for connection of a mobile phone to a TV is really a service with added value. In the box, together with Samsung D600 is delivered a classic composition video cable (pity that the manufacturer doesn't add at least a reduction for S-Video) which consists also of stereophonic sound unit, brought into a pair of separate connectors cinch type. After connecting the phone to the TV everything on the phone display disappears and everything that you have seen on it is now displaying on the TV screen. You'll see also the phone menu and background in an unpleasantly deep blue field. The phone works with PAL and NTSC, you may switch between them in the menu. You may project pictures and video sequences on the screen and listen to music files, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> In addition to the USB cable you'll obtain also a cable for TV connection</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture quality is not bad and much depends on the TV used. That's why on a common TV with no big diagonals (approximately up to 50 cm.) the picture is relatively good, but the quality falls with the increase of the diagonals; on a plasma Hyundai HTP-4205 with diagonals 105 cm... you don't want to know. This, however is not a phone defect, but of the used output, because technically the composition cable just can't provide a quality signal. Why the manufacturer didn't use a component S-Video cable?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The component S Video signal is of higher quality. This method transfers one brightness and two chrominance signals, in separate cables. The picture decoded in such way is high grade; it is required particular by high quality TVs for quality picture display. Not all video recorders and video cards, however have S Video output.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Data with lightning speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fast data transfers with the use of 10 class for GPRS and EDGE (D600E only!) doesn't make any problems. When we decided to connect the phone to PC we had to download from the Samsung web site  the service program Samsung PC Studio 3, which replaces Easy Studio 2 application designed for the older D500 model. It's a pity that a software CD is not a part of the selling package; therefore, you'll need a fast internet connection to download the new program in order to connect the phone to your PC. The whole package is about 50MB, which is less than half of the size of the older Easy Studio 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have used the wireless Bluetooth for connection with PC. It worked as good as a connection via the included USB cable. The connection was stable all the time and didn't disconnect not even once (about 30 minutes connection). You may start a new connection in the application under the item Networking Wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you find yourself in an area with EDGE coverage, Samsung will inform you of this by displaying a small icon with letter E in the upper status line. In case of no luck you will be referred just to GPRS. The icon is red and becomes grey once you launch the data transfers. The speed of the internet connection is moving in the sphere of EDGE coverage with 140 to 165 kb/s for data download; the upload speed is about 40 kb/s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung PC Studio application and connection establishment with the phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung PC Studio consists of separate components and does not serve only for connection to internet. We talk about a complete, stable and graphically well designed package. Let's present it briefly:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organization and other functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the mentioned main functions of the phone you will find also many other applications and standard functions, which we now list:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Calendar - offers daily, weekly and monthly view; synchronization with PC is possible. There is an option to set repeated events, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Monthly, weekly and daily view of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Voice recorder ? can record (according to the setting) up to the maximum allowed size for MMS sending or limited only by the available memory. There is an option to set the visualization, indicating the record in progress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Image Editor ? enables main operations with images and pictures, mode change, for example (black and white, negative, sepia and so on), adjustment of the exposure (brightness, color, contrast), rotation, flip and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Java ? by default the phone contains three games, with an option to install other games and applications via WAP browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Screenshots from the games proposed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? World time  ? enables you to follow the actual time in two preset world capitals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Alarm ? it's repeated, in fact there are three alarm clocks, one of them with snooze function. There is an option to set days in the week in which the alarm should be active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?  Calculator ? relatively simple without memory, very well designed graphically, respects the precedence of mathematical operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Currency converter ? works with the main currency units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Countdown Timer  ? a common timer, which can help in the preparation of boiled eggs or good tea, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>? Stopwatch  ? displays the elapsed time with hundredths and contains five counters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A shiny star is raising<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung D600 is a high quality phone full of features. The price is not the lowest one, but it is reasonable with regard to the capabilities and performance of the phone. The biggest competitors will be Sony Ericsson K750 or Nokia 6230i - also high quality, well featured and currently cheaper. Be careful when you get Samsung D600 in your hands - you may fall in love with it and this is hard to resist.</paragraph>
