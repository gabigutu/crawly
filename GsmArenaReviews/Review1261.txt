			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This Walkman is still learning to walk. But it sure knows how to mix. One part spicy, one part sweet, sprinkled with sexy and fun. Just don?t expect it to mix business with pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not a smartphone. Smartphones come farther down the road. It looks like a long way for the Mix Walkman and it takes music to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman is a fairly basic handset with music, Wi-Fi, stills and video. It?s a touch phone with a neat and efficient interface, good hand fit and customizable body. Affordable and simple to use, it?s not ticking boxes and getting serious stuff done. It?s not in a rush to grow up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An entry-level phone, the Mix Walkman is trying to stay focused on features that are relevant to its target audience. Having covered its music and social bases, it carries no unnecessary weight. It?s an upgrade of the Sony Ericsson Yendo though and has something to show for it. The bigger screen and Wi-Fi are worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Work?s been done on the software too. Sony Ericsson have done their best to emulate the Android experience with the four-corner UI. There?s Facebook and Twitter integration too through the Friends app. You can follow the status updates of five of your friends right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll get to that in due time but first things first. The hardware checkup follows right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman?s retail package has the essential USB cable and detachable charger head, a pair of comfortable earphones and some quick start guides. There is no microSD card included in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one extra accessory you get is the exchangeable band. We had the Green color in our package. The others we know of are Pink Cloud, Pink, Green Bird, Chrome, and Gold.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 95.8 x 52.8 x 14.3 mm the Mix Walkman is reasonably compact and comfortable to hold. The all-plastic handset weighs a manageable 88 g. It does look a bit chubby but the hand fit is great.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s some from both generations of Sony Ericsson minis in the Mix Walkman styling. The curved rubberized back gives it a nice fit in the palm and feels nice to the touch. We?ve seen the so-called human curvature in many of the company's phones. The Mix Walkman is compact and all the controls are within comfortable reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman has a unique customization feature: the exchangeable bands. After removing the battery cover, you can take off the glossy chrome-like frame and exchange it with a more appealing rubberized band from your retail package. It?s easily done and won?t require any special tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit we like our Mix Walkman with the Green color accent better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman sports a 3" WQVGA capacitive touchscreen. No, there?s nothing to love about the sound of it, but even recent smartphones are still stuck at the QVGA resolution. The 3? diagonal is more than the Sony Ericsson Yendo got. The small screen means even this low resolution produces decent sharpness. In the end though, it's hardly the best quality display around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is noticeable gradient banding, and the viewing angles and sunlight legibility are also disappointing. They could have been much worse though. We guess this kind of screen is standard for a cheap phone. On the plus side, the sensitivity is decent ? it?s a capacitive unit after all. But one that doesn?t support multitouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the single hardware button on the front. The Home key, somewhat confusingly, works as a back key sometimes. Above the display are the earpiece and the hidden proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Mix Walkman features a barely protruding volume rocker and the shutter key. They?re both placed on the curve towards the rear ? because of the exchangeable color bands ? but reasonably comfortable to reach and press. The shutter key doesn?t have half-press ? the Mix Walkman has a fixed-focus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side accommodates the Power/Lock key and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Centrally placed at the top of the handset is the 3.5mm audio jack, with music controls on either side: the Walkman key and ZAP button. The bottom of the phone features the mouthpiece and the lanyard eyelet. There's also a tiny dent to put a fingernail and pull the back cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside, we find the 3 MP camera lens, an etched out Walkman logo, the usual Sony Ericsson badge and two speakers for stereo music playback. Just like with the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman, if you place the Mix Walkman down on its back the perceivable sound loudness gets amplified instead of muffled. The battery cover is all black with matte finish for better grip and fingerprint resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals a 1000 mAh battery, the SIM compartment and a non-hot swappable microSD card slot under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman is a simple phone that seems well put together despite the all plastic build and an extra detachable element in the color bands. The screen is said to be scratch-resistant and so is the rubbery finish of the body. Thanks to its curved back the phone is comfortable to hold and operate. The screen is small and the low resolution isn?t that bad indoors. The sunlight legibility is below par though.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simplistic four-corner UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman has the latest Sony Ericsson feature phone interface for touchscreen, sweetened with social services and a Walkman music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar four-corner touch UI does well to imitate the homescreen and main menu of the Mix Walkman?s smarter siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no widgets on the homescreen but you do get two homescreen panes, each with a different function. The first shows the time and the date, while the second one holds your five besties from the Friends app (more on that later). A third homescreen appears when you're running the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handy four-corner shortcuts from the Xperia mini make an appearance here as well. By default, they take you to the Walkman player, Message composer, Phonebook and dialer / call log. You can switch them with any four shortcuts of choice though (just tap and hold anywhere on the main menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the screen there is a thin strip with status info about battery, signal strength and active connections such as WLAN or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher can be pulled up from the bottom of the screen and it features a 3x4 grid of icons arranged into horizontal pages. Newly installed apps go on these pages as well, and icons can be rearranged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman doesn?t support multi-tasking and there is no task switcher. A file browser is nowhere in sight either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yendo uses a regular feature phone CPU and it showed throughout the user interface. The phone was painfully slow. However, we stumbled upon a firmware update and surprise - the performance got notably better. In case your Mix Walkman runs the older version, go ahead and download this and follow the on-screen instructions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with the new firmware, the Mix Walkman is hardly a match for even low-end droids. In the end though, it?s not as laggy as it used to be.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 5000 numbers. It lets you input multiple phone numbers and there are additional fields for stuff like email and postal address, organization, ringtone or birthday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, the various details are displayed in sections. Tapping on a given number dials the contact while opting for the envelope icon next to it launches the message editor. Those two buttons fill an entire horizontal row so that they are more thumbable. The bad news is there?s no socially-relevant stuff in the phonebook. It leaves it all to the Friends app, which in turn can only handle five favorites at a time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony without Smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yendo had no issues with reception and the in-call sound was loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device lacks Smart dialing like most of the recent Sony Ericson phones. It does support searching by number, but this is not the smart dialing we hoped for anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Mix Walkman the call log is a part of the dialer application. Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman automatically disables the touchscreen during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman. The phone scored "Good", meaning you could miss some calls in noisier environments depending on the ringtones you use. You should also know that placing the device down on its back doesn't seem to muffle the sound ? it gets amplified instead. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman?s email client supports both POP and IMAP inboxes, but we had to configure manually. This only took us a few moments though. The Email app interface is simple and thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a screen this small, the lack of a virtual QWERTY keyboard shouldn?t be a surprise. All you get is an alphanumerical keypad, even in landscape.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery interface is a plain grid with the images sorted by date. The app supports up to five megapixel shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the phone has a built-in accelerometer the screen orientation does switch automatically when you rotate the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch-zooming isn?t available but Sony Ericsson have come up with their own version of one-finger zoom that actually works fine. You just hold your finger down and then sweep upwards to zoom in or down to zoom out. It works but it could?ve been quicker and way more responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Mix Walkman sending pics via Bluetooth is easy. You can also send images over email or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is simple in looks and functionality. You get a list of all videos stored in the inbuilt Video folders and the memory card as well as play/pause, skip controls, and a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as playback support is concerned, QVGA MP4 videos are as good as it gets. The Mix Walkman cannot play DivX/XviD or AVI files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Walkman player could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player interface is almost identical to the one we?ve seen on the Android-powered XPERIA family, save for the Walkman logo replacing the Infinite button in the upper part of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to be able to listen to the music stored in your device or on the memory card, you have to move the files to the Music folder. Sound familiar, eh?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no equalizer option in the Mix Walkman and playlists are not supported either. The Mix Walkman arranges your music by artist or you can see the most played tracks, the new additions or all tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shuffle is enabled but you can?t make the Walkman player repeat a track. Even regular dumbphones can do that, can?t they?!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the TrackID service is there. Its user interface is as simple as it gets ? just tap the ?Record? button, record a short sample of a song from any external source and let the app find the artist and track information for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two new features in this Walkman player though: Karaoke and ZAP. The Karaoke shortcut is found at the bottom right corner of the Now Playing screen. Press it and it will mute the vocals and ? ideally ? display the lyrics the way a proper karaoke system would. For the karaoke to work, you need the load the lyrics as a TXT or LRC file to the phone in Mass Storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zappin is another of the new Walkman features. You turn it with the ZAP button at the top of the phone. Turning Zappin on will let you preview the tracks in your playlist by playing 4 or 15 seconds of the track?s chorus. Once you?ve found the one you want, pressing the ZAP key again will turn Zappin off and the current track will start the track from the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Mix Walkman does not have support for WAV playback (or any uncompressed audio actually), so we could not perform our traditional audio quality test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier skipping to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite for quicker access.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 3 megapixel snapper is disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things, the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman has a 3 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. There is neither autofocus nor flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is as simple as it gets with three buttons in total. There is a camera/camcorder switch, a gallery button and an on-screen shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no geotagging or advanced image settings. This is certainly one of the most basic camera interfaces on the market but we guess Sony Ericsson thought users wouldn?t need much more and would prefer simplicity to functionality. In the end, it all comes down to the image quality, so let?s see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the amount of resolved detail is pretty low and the contrast of the photos is a mixed bag. And with the noise levels also pretty high, you get the idea that you better use the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman camera for taking contact pics only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see from the comparison tool that the shots are pretty much identical with most of the 3 megapixel snappers out there.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the Mix Walkman goes as high as QVGA resolution, which, needless to say, is far from impressive. The frame rate is also low - just 14 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera. You can only set the video quality, no other settings are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are rendered in 3gp format, but actually look good. Then again the low resolution and frame rate make them useful only for MMS and nothing more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a QVGA@14fps video sample to check it for yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi is the only notable connectivity setting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman is an entry-level handset and nobody should expect an impressive connectivity package. There are no GPS or 3G, but Wi-Fi b/g is quite a perk. Network data speed is limited to GPRS and EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity comes down to USB v2.0 and Bluetooth. There?s also a memory card slot, which can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates, but it?s under the battery, so no hot swap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Obigo Q7 web browser on the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman is good enough. It lacks Flash support but considering the small and low-res display and the slow CPU even if there was Flash on board, you wouldn?t have been able to fully enjoy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser user interface is rather minimalist ? all you get on the screen are controls on the bottom of the screen. Those include four large buttons ? back, search, reload and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on ?more? will bring you to a few more on-screen keys which allow you to add the visited website to the main menu or to send the link (as text or email).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no way to zoom in or out on the page and there is no support for multiple tabs either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of missing Flash support, there is one more thing missing ? the YouTube app which would?ve made up for the lack of Flash video. But you could always use the mobile version of YouTube, it works just fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Friends app and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Friends app is one of the highlights of the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman. It is sort of like those SNS-enabled, tabbed phonebooks that we've seen on custom Android skins. It has five tabs - call log, list of text messages, a tab each for Twitter and Facebook updates and finally some contact management options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does great but supports up to five contacts and no more, which some might find not enough. Anyway, each contact is represented by their contact photo - the five are always visible at the top of the app and you can tap them to switch to that contact. The second homescreen holds the five contact photos that work as shortcuts - there are no status updates displayed there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook status updates can be "liked" and you can comment on them, but there's no way to post a status update of your own, the Friends app is purely for following. You can reply to tweets, but again, you can't send a new one from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are conspicuous Go to Facebook and Go to Twitter buttons available - there are even Facebook and Twitter shortcuts in the menu - but unfortunately they all lead to the mobile site of the respective social network, viewed inside the native browser. That overall is an unattractive, barely usable option that we're not happy with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook recently released an official Java app, which looks very much like the Android app and works great on touchscreen. It supports most of Facebook's features (Chat is missing though), including things that the Friends app can't do (like viewing your friends' galleries). You can even add and manage Facebook apps, which are an easy way to add a lot of functionality to the basic app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into Facebook, the Java app is the best way to stay connected on the Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman has no preinstalled document viewer. You can still use the native Notes app if you want to write down and save a note. Your saved notes will appear as an extra homescreen pane, just like the music player widget does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has two view modes - daily and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator, voice recorder, timer, stopwatch as well as a decent alarm clock aboard. Those are all nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are very easy to set too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also preinstalled there are a couple of game demos (Quadrapop, Night Club Fever, BB Revolution and Music Quiz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else in the start menu is just a shortcut to a specific mobile website (like Gmail, Yahoo, Orkut, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A simple music phone with Wi-Fi and some basic social skills sounds good. And well, it?s a Walkman so it sounds good. There?s even a firmware upgrade already ? this phone?s in the low end but not quite in the middle of nowhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mix Walkman comes cheap so there?s much to forget but nothing to forgive. Better screens, better cameras and more functionality are at an arm?s length but smartphones are not everyone?s cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way is up for anybody owning the Mix Walkman. They will eventually be ready for a smartphone. In fact, they will want one sooner rather than later. That?s why it doesn?t feel right to suggest older and cheaper droids as an alternative. Yes, the first-gen Xperia X10 mini and the W8 cost the same and offer more. But it?s not about ticking boxes and completing checklists. It takes more than that to make a loyal user. Sony Ericsson must be thinking: ?Let them love their Walkman, there?s time for them to love their droids.?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini ? Sony Ericsson W8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the droids will come. The likes of the Live with Walkman and the new Xperia mini are the next logical step. The future belongs to them. Affordable and friendly phones like the Mix Walkman can do little against smartphones that are just as affordable and friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman ? Sony Ericsson Xperia mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have already realized they have no choice but move towards a smartphone only portfolio. The Mix Walkman and the txt pro may as well be the last of their kind. They will hardly make a splash but perhaps can make a difference for their young users. The kind of difference Sony Ericsson want them to make.</paragraph>
