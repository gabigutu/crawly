		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has mostly stayed out of the phablet market but the segment is expanding so fast the Taiwanese can't afford to keep snubbing it. The HTC Desire 816 is only the company's second phablet and it's the first affordable one. It rides on the premium looks and stereo speakers of the One series, with the rest being mostly midrange specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 is in a way related to the One mini 2. It may not have its aluminum unibody (unfortunately), but it has the same camera setup and is powered by the same chipset. The screen has the same resolution (720p) but is a good deal larger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only big deal in the negative column is the relatively small battery - 2,600mAh is phone-grade battery capacity. It does have the Extreme power saving mode, but that's not meant for daily usage. We'll run our battery test to determine how much battery size hurts the phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the HTC Desire 816 checks all the right boxes - a promising 13MP / 1080p camera, a decent selfie cam, solid audio credentials, LTE connectivity, expandable storage and the latest software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flagship smartphones seem to have hit a wall with innovation and have started piling on gimmicky features. So it's segments like midrange phones and phablets that emerge as the new drivers of growth and we're glad HTC didn't miss that boat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But how good a midrange phablet can we expect from a company that has so far been most prominent in the premium smartphone business? Reception in China has been great, with millions of people genuinely interested in the Desire 816 but flip to the next page for a more Western perspective on it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 816 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 measures 156.6 x 78.7 x 8mm meaning it's decently thin and not too tall either, considering other HTC phones are typically the tallest in their segment due to the stereo BoomSound speakers. The weight of 165g makes this one of the lighter 5.5" phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro, another 5.5" phablet, is just 150.2mm tall and LG's skill at slimming down bezels culminated in the G Pro 2, which is a tad taller than the Desire 816 but packs a 5.9" screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 loosely follows the basic floor plan of HTC's premium One family but, being a Desire member, it takes a more budget-minded approach to build materials. There are some changes to the design that we mostly like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having some of the tallest phones, HTC keeps putting the Lock key on the top where it's hard to reach. With the Desire 816, a rather tall device, the company moved the Lock key to the left side where in theory it's easier to reach. Putting it above the volume rocker, near the very top, however, means it's still a stretch and you don't have tap-to-wake to help you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the phablet is deceptively light for its 165g and it's on the edge of being too wide to hold comfortably without crossing over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to say we have mixed feelings about the plastic that makes up the exterior of the phablet. The matte plastic that circles the sides and covers the BoomSound speakers is quite pleasant to the touch and good-looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire surface of the back, however, is the type of glossy, fingerprint magnet plastic we've grown tired of. It's very prone to scratches too, ours is already showing signs of wear after just a few days spent mostly sitting on our desks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lock key and volume rocker are metal, painted to match the rest of the phone's body with only their borders showing the shiny metal underneath. They sure do look good but the volume rocker in particular is so wobbly it feels disappointingly cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end the HTC Desire 816 is a mixed bag - the base design is attractive and the execution is decent but a few elements bring down the overall impression. It just feels a bit cheaper than it should have (and than it actually is).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has a 5.5" LCD of 720p resolution. The pixel density is an average 267ppi - just shy of what has become known as Retina-grade, but as good as can be expected given the phablet's midrange standing. Unfortunately, it's left without the protection of a scratch-resistant glass so you should be careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an IPS display too, evident by the excellent viewing angles. Up close you can notice some jaggedness and the colors are not as vibrant as some of us like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bigger concern is that the display isn't exceptionally bright and we kept it at maximum most of the time. The contrast ratio is quite good though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively low reflectivity makes the display usable outside, though we've seen devices fare much better in this respect. Some flagships don't do too hot in this test either (we're looking at you Sony Xperia Z2).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has two stereo speakers - one above and one below the screen. They have dedicated amps to ensure they produce top quality audio, just like on the One (M8). They are positioned on the very edge of the device, sitting as wide apart as possible for the best possible stereo effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera is on top, right next to one of the BoomSound speakers. It's off-center which is not ideal for video calling, but promises great image quality with a 5MP BSI sensor that can capture 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below the camera is a status LED that lights up when charging and blinks for notification. You can chose which events trigger the light - missed calls, messages, email, calendar events and alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android keys have moved on-screen, but that still leaves a black bar below the screen with the HTC logo. There's quite a bit of bezel above the screen and to its sides, but they are not excessive for a device this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Desire 816 is not removable, so you don't have access to the 2,600mAh Li-Po battery. The camera and LED flash are in the top left corner but the device is big enough so that we didn't accidentally cover the lens with a finger while holding the phablet landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-removable back panel means the card slots had moved to the side. There are three of them - two nanoSIM and one microSD - though in the international version the second SIM slot is just a dummy. It's only used in the Chinese version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Desire 816 has 8GB of built-in memory, 4.2GB of which is user accessible, so you'll probably need to put a microSD card as soon as you buy the phablet. It supports cards of up to 128GB though, so you won't find yourself short of storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, all three slots are covered under a single flap that lays flush with the side of the device. We like this setup as you can easily access the cards without an ejector tool and it doesn't look bad by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phablet features a 3.5mm audio jack and a secondary mic for noise cancellation. The bottom is home to just the microUSB 2.0 port. It supports USB On The Go so you can hook up a mouse, keyboard or external storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered the buttons on the left side of the Desire 816 - the volume rocker and Power/Lock key. To recap, they are not easy to reach and feel wobbly (they look good though).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 comes in two versions, single and dual-SIM. Unfortunately, the dual-SIM option seems limited to China Unicom only. Note that, despite its size, the phablet uses nanoSIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The base version has quad-band 2G/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSPA+ (up to 42Mbps downlink) and 4G LTE. The LTE has four bands, which vary by region - EMEA, China, Taiwan and Australia get slightly different 4G bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM version adds WCDMA and CDMA EV-DO support to the first SIM slot, along with the China-specific TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE. The second SIM is GSM voice only on four bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is the same across all versions with Wi-Fi b/g/n, DLNA and Bluetooth 4.0 with the aptX audio codec. There's A-GPS and GLONASS for positioning too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is listed as optional and indeed our unit did not have it. HTC hasn't published a list of markets that get NFC, so that's something to check before buying one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the HTC Mini+, a phone-shaped Bluetooth headset is compatible with the Desire 816 so you can keep the large phablet in your bag and still accept calls and control the music player. Speaking of that, the Bluetooth-enabled HTC BoomBass cube can pair wirelessly with the stereo speakers on the phablet for even better sonic experience. Finally, HTC Media Link HD adds DLNA support to TVs that don't have it natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has a rather small battery for its size, just 2,600mAh. It does have a Power Saving and Extreme Power Saving modes though. The first just dims the screen and throttles the CPU, while the second disables multitasking altogether and replaces the homescreen with a simplified version that has only the basic apps available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we can't test with these modes as they are for emergencies only. We weren't expecting much out of the Desire 816 so it came as a surprise to us when it scored 64 hours endurance rating. Individual tests were quite excellent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC officially states 21 hour talk time on 3G, which we think is a tall order, but almost 15 hours is good enough too. The web browsing and video playback times are particularly good, however. Do note that we test at 50% brightness and the 5.5" screen gets rather dim at that setting (about 160 nits).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got a question asking us to compare the battery life of the Desire 816 with the HTC One (M8). The flagship did score a slightly higher endurance rating (71 hours), in large part thanks to lasting longer in a call. However, the Desire 816 outlasts it by nearly 3 hours when it comes to browsing and more or less matches it at video playback.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.4.2 KitKat with Sense 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat, dressed in the version of HTC Sense UI, matching the One (M8) and One mini 2. HTC Sense 6 brings new features on board and improves the existing functionality of the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a quick video of HTC Desire 816 with Sense 6 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features a clock with weather info plus four shortcut slots. Missed calls and incoming messages are duly displayed too of course. Widgets are optional and disabled by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up the unlock button gives you three different options. Swiping up takes you to the last app you used, while swiping to the left or to the right will take you to the homescreen or BlinkFeed respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the HTC One (M8) the Desire 816 phablet cannot be unlocked with a swipe or double tap, meaning you have to reach for the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This generation of HTC products features on-screen buttons with the classic arrangement of Back, Home and App switcher. HTC's custom scheme of Back and Home only has been dropped (and we don't miss it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the Desire 816 is once again reserved for HTC BlinkFeed. It aggregates content from your social networks, as well as from over a thousand news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're not stuck with BlinkFeed if you don't like it - the rest of the homescreen panes are the standard affair with shortcuts and widgets. You can also fully remove the BlinkFeed panel if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features toggles similar to those of vanilla Android. They can be accessed via the dedicated button or with a two-finger swipe. The toggles can't be reordered or hidden, but a long press brings out the relevant Settings page. Some (like the Brightness toggle) are multi stage so you tap them several times until you reach the desired mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the status bar on top of the screen is normally semi-transparent or black, but select HTC apps change its color to match their own highlight color, similar to iOS. This doesn't seem to work with third-party apps though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default layout of the app drawer is a 4 x 5 grid of app icons. A 3 x 4 mode is also available but that's a waste of a 5.5" screen. You can sort app icons alphabetically, chronologically or manually and you can hide the ones you don't need but can't uninstall (bloatware).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has remodeled the task switching interface - recent apps are displayed in a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails. This allows more apps to fit on the screen but since there's no scrolling 9 is all the recent apps you'll see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense has a dedicated Car mode screen, which can launch automatically when the phablet connects to your car's Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire 816 also has a built-in restricted access Kid mode. It is an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 runs Android 4.4 KitKat with Sense 6 out of the box. It's powered by a Snapdragon 400 MSM8928 chipset with four Cortex-A7 processor cores at 1.6GHz and Adreno 305 GPU. It has 1.5GB of RAM. interestingly, this one is better spec'd than the HTC One mini 2, and yet it costs less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This should give it an edge in performance over the likes of the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra, but HTC's phablet should be behind the Exynos Hexa-powered Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick off with a simple CPU benchmark that, expectedly, places the Desire 816 above the Xperia T2 Ultra (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.4GHz), but behind the Galaxy Note 3 Neo (a hexa-core processor with two Cortex-A15 @ 1.7GHz as the muscle).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the results prove to be not very reliable as we ran both the Play Store version and the anti-cheat versions of Basemark OS II and there was a noticeable change in score.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to AnTuTu, we see that the Desire 816 tops the lot of affordable phablets in overall performance, but keep in mind the results are probably a bit off due to benchmark optimizations on HTC's part.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>The on-screen versions of the GFX 3D benchmark didn't run at a satisfactory framerate.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the HTC phablet has a 720p screen we should be looking at the on-screen results. And as could have been expected, Adreno 305 just isn't up to snuff when it comes to delivering quality 3D graphics at 720p. Even the relatively old GFX 2.7 T-Rex test didn't get anywhere near a playable framerate.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>JavaScript performance is not great, though it's in line with what we can expect from a mid-range device. In the BrowserMark 2.1, an HTML5 test, the HTC Desire 816 score was proportional to the JavaScript score. These tests fully stress the browser (we used the stock browser, by the way), in daily browsing the phablet works without annoying slowdowns.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 is a middle of the road device when it comes to performance. It's not sluggish by any means and it will do okay for daily multitasking, browsing and even 3D games. From a user point of view, we didn't experience any</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Threaded phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app groups the dialer, call log, contacts, favorites and groups in tabs, which can reordered or removed. A dropdown allows you to filter contacts by source - stored in the phone, coming from an online phonebook or a social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual contact info is displayed in tabs too, a Sense tradition. The first tab shows basic contact info like phone numbers, emails, work info plus individual options for ringtones, blocking the contact and adding them to Private contacts. That's a discrete option that hides the name and photo of a contact when there's an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab, Thread lists all communication history between you and the given contact - texts, emails and calls. The third and final tab displays the contact's social networking updates. Tabs here can be reordered and hidden too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with DND mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC Desire 816 displays the last call with a contact photo so you can easily redial someone. There's smart dialing that looks for both names and contacts. You can even switch to a regular QWERTY keyboard though you have to do this each time you open the dialer and we still find that the dial pad is quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Large dial pad mode, which predictably makes the buttons bigger but also displays the full call log behind the pad (instead of just the last call as with the Standard dial pad). When you try to scroll the list, the dial pad gets out of the way. For these reasons we preferred this mode over the Standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 can ring louder when it detects it's in a pocket, quiet down when you pick it up and shut up altogether when you flip it over. Do not disturb mode can mute all notifications (including timers and alarms if you like) on a given schedule with multiple rules, e.g. not on weekends and not on weekdays after 19pm. Only contacts on the exceptions list can get through in case of emergency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be added to the blocked list to filter out unwanted calls even outside of Do not disturb mode. If you dial an unknown contact, the dialer can ask you if you want to save it to the phonebook (this is disabled by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet borrows the BoomSound speakers from the premium One family - two speakers on the front with dedicated amps. They put out beautiful sound though in tuning for audio quality HTC lost some of the loudness. In fact, the HTC One (M8) managed to get a lower score than the One (M8), which pulled ahead in our final test for ringing. Voice and music levels are virtually equal with the Desire 816 though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with great features out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 uses the traditional threaded view for SMS and MMS messages, which share a composer. Some threads can be moved to a "secure box", which requires a password to be opened. There's built-in functionality to block messages from certain numbers, those go in the Block box where you can view them later if you like or set the app to discard them immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The look can be tweaked with color schemes and custom backgrounds, font size and how many lines are used for preview in threaded view. The Messages app can also backup and restore messages, so you don't need a third-party app for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 comes with two email apps - the other is the dedicated Gmail app and a skinned version of the stock email app. It has a combined inbox and supports options for peak and off-peak syncing. For both you can have the app check for new mail after at preset periods or use Smart Sync to learn your habits and automatically figure out the best interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard offers big, comfortable keys and you can run a calibration tool if you think the default setup slips up. A Swype-like Trace option is available and you can enable bilingual prediction (vital with so many English terms entering every day speech in most languages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other customization options include switching between layouts (e.g. QWERTY, AZERTY), adding arrow keys (for the portrait keyboard only) and a personal dictionary of words that can be backed up to the microSD card or an email.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe is social<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is a mini social network centered around sharing photos and videos. A landmark feature is the cool Highlights videos, which are created automatically for each album (more on that in a minute).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe requires you to sign in with your HTC account the first time you open it. This is to enable sharing with other contacts, who can add their own photos, videos and music to the Highlight videos that are created automatically from your shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can send requests to your friends too, to give them a little nudge to add shots to your Highlights. You can manually create a Highlight video too - you simply choose from the available images, select a theme and soundtrack and you're done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery with Highlights<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app uses tabs to separate viewing modes. Timeline and location group photos accordingly, while Albums work like folders. You can manually create albums, the app will ask you to select a number of photos and videos to either copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manually created albums get a Highlight video as their title image. You can select which items go into the video, in what order and with what effects and music. There are options to go back to the default chronological order, music and theme so don't be afraid to experiment. The start and end clips can be selected manually if you want to create a sort of title card and credits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editing options range from basic crop / rotate / flip to frames and advanced effects like simulated lighting, adjusting face contour and eye enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a special Media gesture useful here and in the music and video players - swipe up with three fingers to "throw" the content you're viewing to a DLNA device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player on the HTC Desire 816, you browse videos through the Gallery. The video players supports the most common containers - AVI, MP4 and MKV - but codec support is spotty. DivX didn't work, while XviD support was 50/50. Sound is an issue too with no multichannel audio support, we even had an issue with MP3 audio in a 1080p AVI file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the interface, you get basic playback controls and the option to snap a screenshot. Subtitles are not supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with no equalizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense 6 music player uses a tabbed layout and as with other apps you can hide tabs and reorder them. The tabs sort your music library by different categories and include the relatively rare Folder view, in case you have a sort of "mixtape" folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time you launch the music player it will ask whether it should automatically download Album art, artist photos and lyrics and you can limit it to Wi-Fi only downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a cool visualizer on board with multiple different looks, but HTC once again forgot to put in an equalizer. All you get is a BoomSound option, which can be either on or off and only works with headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still audiophiles should be glad to hear FLAC is supported (both 16-bit and 24-bit) but you'll really need a microSD card for that as the built-in memory isn't much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the three-finger Media gesture to continue playback on a DLNA device. Bluetooth with aptX is another high-quality option to wirelessly stream audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 also packs an FM radio receiver too and it has RDS support. It can play through the speakers but still needs a pair of headphones to serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Outstanding audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 may be a mid-ranger, but its audio output screams high-end. The phablet managed to put one of the most impressive performances we've seen in our audio quality test, posting sublime scores and garnishing them with nicely strong output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 did absolutely impeccably in the first part of the test - posting great scores top to bottom and garnishing them with above average volume levels. More impressively, however, it showed next to no degradation when the headphones came into play - the stereo crosstalk spike was among the smallest we have seen and the resulting score is better than some smartphones manage without headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, there are very few devices that would do better than the HTC Desire 816 and virtually all of them come from the same manufacturer. However, so far they belonged to the One lineup of pricier devices and it's good to see HTC bringing the excellent audiophile experience down the ranks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Finally a camera that makes Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has a 13MP camera. Instead of a low-resolution UltraPixel sensor HTC went with a more traditional BSI sensor with a 28mm lens (in 35mm equivalent) and f/2.2 aperture. It's a 4:3 sensor too, meaning you lose some resolution when taking 16:9 shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This camera is not backed by an ImageChip so a handful of options are missing (Zoe mode most notably). It does have HDR, Panorama (with a digital horizon level), geo-tagging and image effects. The settings are hidden by default, but you can control ISO, exposure compensation, white balance and image adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the screen will enable Auto Exposure and Auto Focus lock. You can set the volume rocker to act as a zoom lever or a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has a 5MP front-facing camera with a BSI sensor and a dedicated selfie mode. From the settings you can enable smile shutter and adjust the Make-up level, which tries to digitally pretty you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 camera produces surprisingly good photos. In fact, they are unlike anything we've seen from an HTC phone. It's a clear departure from the image processing of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has finally nailed it. The photos produced by this 13MP camera may not be the sharpest or the noiseless ones we've seen, but they exhibit extremely well-tuned rendering. The image processing is so mature that it's like HTC has brought somebody from the iPhone's team to work on the software side of things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pretty sure it's also not a one-off streak of luck. Our time with the latest HTC One mini 2, which has an identically spec'd camera, show more of the same thing. It's as if both use the same camera module and processing settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are more than pleased with the way the camera picks exposure and colors, even in mixed light. Digital noise is visible but it's not that obvious as it takes the form of only luminance noise. There are no color blotches. There's equal sharpness edge to edge and there are no noticeable lens issues. The white balance is sometimes a bit too warm but some people like it that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the camera we would have expected to see from the HTC One flagship last year. It's a pity to see it come at a so late point in time.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has one really nice camera. The only downside is that it tends to pick a warmer white balance to most photos, which results in a yellowish tint, which is noticeable on our sample images, and especially the first chart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, in our photo quality compare tool you can see how it stacks up against competing phablets like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo (8MP) and the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (13MP) by following the links below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The video camera marks an improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 shoots 1080p videos at 30fps, though there's also a 60fps mode at 720p. The front-facing camera can also record 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other options include slow-motion video, image effects and settings for ISO, exposure compensation and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p footage quality is markedly better than anything HTC had so far in the Desire lineup. We can probably say it's on par with what the HTC One mini produces, but the level of resolved details falls short of reaching the original HTC One or the One (M8). Another thing to note is that the colors seems a bit oversaturated, but oftentimes it's how users prefer them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p have a 20Mbps bitrate and the audio is recorded in stereo with a bitrate of 192kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC is no longer the underdog in the camera race. Even the midrange Desire 816 fares quite well when compared to identically price phablets, as you can see in our Video comparison tool. Unfortunately, the oversaturation of colors and the slight yellow tint that we saw in the still photos, is visible in the videos as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 has a Sense-ified version of the stock Android browser and Chrome out of the box. It packs the usual features of Incognito tabs Find in page and Desktop view. Note that GIF animation needs to be enabled from the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the usual bookmarks, you can keep a Reading list of pages to read later and a Watch list of videos. Pages are saved on-device so they can be read offline, but videos are not. The Watch list feature works on sites like YouTube and Vimeo. It detects multiple videos per page (so you can add them all) and when you're ready to watch it shows just the video with no distractions from the page it was on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is becoming the most popular mobile browser should be fairly familiar. It has advantages over its vanilla buddy, including switching between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome has Incognito tabs, too. Speaking of tabs, it can sync what you have open on other devices (desktop, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option sends web pages to be compressed on Google's web servers before loading them on the device to save data and speed up slow connections. This doesn't work for SSL-protected pages and Incognito tabs for privacy reasons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 comes with Polaris Office 5, which can view and create Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, it can display PDFs too. The app handles files stored locally along with ones in your Google Drive account. The View Together option lets you do a presentation on multiple devices by connecting them together wirelessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has skinned the calendar to match Sense 6 looks. Adding an event lets you specify time (with a warning if there's a conflict with another event), who will attend and where the meeting will be held. Multiple online calendars are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks app is another way to organize time. It can handle multiple separate lists of tasks and syncs with your Google account. Each task can have a due date and a location associated with it. Map view lets you easily find nearby tasks, though we would have loved a "Navigate to" button here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Backup can do manual or scheduled backups of your apps, messages (texts and emails), contacts and accounts (mail and social). The data is sent either to Google Drive or Dropbox and you can limit the app to transfer over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also preloaded Stocks and Weather apps powered by Yahoo! And AccuWeather respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the default navigation app and is the only one a typical user needs. It allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection. It can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. With a connection it will also display traffic alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Guide app is an excellent app for beginners. It contains tips and help, troubleshooting info and a display of the vital phone stats the support call center might ask you about. The Phone health option offers some self-help tools like running diagnostic on individual components (speakers, backlight, buttons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app will also help you manage the storage with a handy option to clean unwanted files and trackers for call minutes, texts and data plan megabytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool is Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices with a Google account can help you find your Desire 816 by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data (so make sure you have HTC Backup set up so you don't lose your data).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 is only HTC's second attempt at a phablet - a bit unusual considering the segment has been expanding rapidly. So why is HTC hesitant to enter it with both feet the way other companies have?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It couldn't have been doubt in its own abilities, HTC makes some of the best-built devices on the market. The Desire 816 was a bit of a letdown in that respect - it's a beautiful device for sure, but the plastic on the back and the side buttons cheapen the feel of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, it's a midrange device so we can't expect premium materials though Sony has been offering its metal-and-glass design on a budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, what you get for the average price tag of the HTC Desire 816 is a beautiful screen and visually-appealing, functional software. Sense 6 may not be pure Holo Android, but is arguably better looking than other popular Android skins with its flat design and pastel color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is great too, with good quality 13MP stills and 1080p video. We'd take this over any 4MP UltraPixel camera without a blink. Another area where the Desire 816 punches above its weight is audio - the stereo speakers sound great and the audio quality with headphones in is worthy of a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has another tablet that sorts the build quality issues, the HTC One Max, which has an aluminum body. It's a large device, though it has a great 5.9" 1080p screen, flanked by BoomSound speakers, a much faster chipset (Snapdragon 600), a larger battery and expandable storage. It still commands a hefty premium though, almost a year since launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One Max</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is a more affordable version of the company's flagship Note 3 phablet. It has a 5.5" 720p Super AMOLED screen with deep blacks and bright colors. You get a Wacom stylus too, plus the Note 3 Neo is a full 8mm shorter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset tops the four Cortex-A7s of the Desire 816 with two extra Cortex-A15 cores. All six cores can work simultaneously and the Mali-T624 GPU wipes the floor with Adreno 305. The camera is an 8MP / 1080p shooter but a good one and there's 16GB of onboard storage, double that of the Desire 816. The battery is bigger to boot, at 3,100mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The faux leather back of the Galaxy Note 3 Neo may not be to everyone's taste, but it's miles ahead of the glossy plastic HTC used. Samsung did launch it with Android 4.3 though, that's one point against as the Desire 816 already comes with Android 4.4. KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another ex-flagship phablet is the LG G Pro. It's actually more compact than the Desire 816, at the same 5.5" screen diagonal. It's a sharper screen (1080p) with Gorilla Glass 2 and you get a Snapdragon 600 chipset like in the One Max. You do lose the stereo speakers, but it's priced somewhere between the two HTCs and the price premium seems acceptable for the advantages offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro E985</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another fairly compact 5.5" phablet with a 1080p screen is the Oppo Find 7a. It costs around the same as the One Max, but it's a 2014 phone - that means an even more powerful Snapdragon 801 chipset and 2160p video. It has a 13MP main camera and a 5MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 7a</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want big and beautiful, the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is a prime example of the metal-and-glass OmniBalance design with a 7.7mm thin chassis and a dedicated camera key. It's a large device with a 6" 720p screen, other than that it's very close in terms of specs to the Desire 816. There's a dual-SIM version too and you don't have to be in China to get it. Note that it runs Android 4.3 at the moment, and the KitKat update has only been promised but is not yet delivered. And also its back cover is made of a very similar glossy plastic as the one on the Desire 816.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia T2 Ultra ? Sony Xperia T2 Ultra dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another 6" dual-SIM phablet is available from Alcatel. The Alcatel Hero packs a sharp 1080p screen and a slightly different chipset but with roughly similar performance. It has a noticeably bigger battery (3,400mAh) and a stylus, too. Note that the single-SIM version of the device has a microSD card slot, while the dual-SIM does not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alcatel Hero</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one reason or another, HTC has largely stayed out of phablets but that doesn't make the Desire 816 a poorly-executed device. The only thing missing is HTC's traditionally high build quality. The rest of the device is pretty good and it all comes down to pricing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 816 is quite affordable in Asia (China, India), making it a smart choice, though not necessarily the only one. In Europe, it's priced higher than the Galaxy Note 3 Neo or the Xperia T2 Ultra, which is something to consider when you're drawing up your shortlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC phones have been known to hit the market at ridiculously high price tags and one consolation is that the price might settle to a more acceptable level in a couple of months or your carrier might have a nice deal for you. In this case, you can hardly go wrong with picking the Desire 816. It's a well-rounded package and while it may not win any awards, it sure isn't worse than any other midrange phablet.</paragraph>
