			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>How do you compare phones that are so different - the LG G3 and HTC One (M8) barely have a common feature between them. As we found out though, even different specs can create a similar user experience, it's more than just a numbers game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into this article we had a certain idea of how things will work out but a series of tests once again proved that specs rarely tell the whole story. The 5.5" QHD screen should handily beat the 5" 1080p screen, right? And the contest between a 3,000mAh battery and a 2,600mAh one should be fairly straightforward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should but the LG G3 proved less dominant than it sounds on paper. The HTC One (M8) on the other hand, still has downsides it found hard to overcome. Here's a quick blow by blow of where each phone dominates its opponent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One (M8) over LG G3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is a budding illusionist. It looks deceptively small, almost the same size as its opponent despite having a 20% larger screen. The back looks, and to a certain extent feels, like metal, but is actually a specially coated plastic. The screen, of course, is the first QHD unit (1,440 x 2,560 pixels) from a major manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has a true metal unibody - it's difficult to tell by looks, but touch is a dead giveaway. HTC focused on the experience, a lot of which comes from software features including a revamped Zoe backed by a new dual camera and improved stereo speakers on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UX has become one of the 21st century buzzwords yet a lot of it comes from the past, our preconceptions. This means users will scoff at the plastic "metal" of the LG G3 even if they won't notice it until you tell them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a matter of how well each company managed to read their consumers - the 4MP camera of the One (M8) stands little chance against the muscled up 13MP shooter of the LG G3, but a 5MP selfie camera is a perfect match for the social networks that rule the day, same goes for the effect-laden Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, proceed with an open mind to the next page to see if HTC's traditional strength - design - has been countered by LG's newfound creativity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two phones are slightly rounded rectangles apparently made of metal. However, there's a striking difference between them when you put them side by side. There's a generous amount of space around the HTC One's 5" screen, while the 5.5" display of the LG G3 looks like it's ready to bust out of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are equally tall, but the LG G3 is slightly wider and thinner. It measures 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9mm while the One (M8) is 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4mm. Width is the most important factor for in-hand feel, but weight plays a role too and the LG is lighter - 149g vs. 160g. Hardly a surprise as plastic is lighter than metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both screens are secured by Corning Gorilla Glass but the One M8's display has a good deal of padding all around. Most of that comes from the two stereo speakers with dedicated amplifiers. There's a special edition of the One (M8) with Clear-Fi audio tech from Harman/Kardon but that's only available for Sprint in the US at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the LG G3 only has noticeable bezel above and below the screen and even they are not particularly big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC kept the aluminum unibody from last year's One but added a new finish option - brushed metal for the Gunmetal Grey color. The other two colors - Glacial Silver and Amber Gold - have a matte finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 looks like brushed metal finish and comes in five colors. It has a special coating and, although not self-healing like the LG G Flex, LG says it's still resistant to scratches. The plastic is warm to the touch (giving away that it's not metal) but it looks the part and feels great in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key difference here is that the back is removable so you can access the 3,000mAh battery and two card slots below (microSIM and microSD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) has a sealed 2,600mAh battery and the card slots are on the sides, you'll need an ejector tool to access those. Note that it uses nanoSIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backs of both devices are unique in their own ways. The HTC One (M8) has two cameras, the second one used solely for image effects. The LG G3 positions its Power key/Volume rocker assembly right below the camera and adds a special light emitter here used by the Laser autofocus system. Both phones use dual-tone, dual-LED flashes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 loudspeaker is on the back - there's only one, but it's quite powerful. Normally it produces 1W worth of sound, but with boost it can reach 1.5W.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tops and bottom of both phones are quite similar. There are IR blasters on top for remote control functions, while the bottom houses microUSB 2.0 ports and 3.5mm audio jacks. Unfortunately, the HTC One (M8) puts its Power button on top where it's hard to reach on the 146.4mm tall device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key on the back of the LG G3 is much easier to reach though it takes some getting used to (we kept tapping the side of the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices support double-tap to wake so you don't need the hardware key to unlock the device. Both have their own tricks too - the HTC One (M8) can also be unlocked by a swipe up, while the LG G3 features Knock Code that lets you create a pattern of taps to make the tap to unlock option as secure as the pattern lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. We know some of you adore aluminum unibodies (we do too!) but the HTC One (M8) is just too big for its screen size. A bigger, accessible battery and better positioning of the Power key may sound like small potatoes but can have a big impact day to day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is certainly a looker, but HTC had a chance to improve on some things since last year's One and chose not to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 brings the first QHD screen from a big name maker. QHD or Quad HD has four times the number of pixels of a 720p screen, 1,440 x 2,560 to be exact. This means that even at 5.5", the screen still offers the whopping 534ppi pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That may not sound like too much over the 441ppi of the HTC One (M8) and its 5" 1080p screen but there's a tangible difference in perception. Talking about sharpness here is probably meaningless - both screens are very sharp and individual pixels are impossible to distinguish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the LG G3 screen seems more vivid, it's hard to describe but you can spot the difference in person. Not that the HTC One (M8) screen looks bad, in fact there's a lot more to screen image quality than just pixel count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both screens manage around 570 nits of brightness at full blast, a very solid figure. The black levels on the LG G3 are higher than average for a flagship screen (0.40-0.50 nits), which drops the contrast ratio to less than 800:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super LCD3 on the HTC One (M8) on the other hand stays within the norm for blacks on an LCD and offers great 1256:1 contrast. The LG G2 was a king in this category with nearly 1500:1, thanks to good black levels and 670 nit white levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, notice that the brightness slider is heavily skewed - at 50%, the display put out less than a fifth of its maximum brightness. The HTC One (M8) was at a little less than half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another area where the LG flagship suffered a setback is sunlight legibility. Granted, the reduction is fairly small, but there shouldn't have been any at all - this was a bit of a weak spot of the LG G2, one we were hoping the successor would do something about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is no champ here either, but it does beat the LG G2, G3 and Sony Xperia Z2. Strangely, it regressed slightly from its predecessor too (as did the Xperia Z2, what's going on with those new screens?).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Different viewing angles have virtually no effect on the image on both screens, but colors on the HTC One (M8) are slightly punchier than those on the LG G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two screens are very different in terms of size too. The 5.5" screen of the LG G3 has 20% more surface area than the 5" screen of the HTC One (M8). This means you can fit more content and that difference grows even further if you zoom out a little (the extra pixels make tiny text more legible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. We were disappointed by some of the characteristics of the display, the regression in contrast especially, plus, sunlight legibility should have improved rather than worsened. That said, it's hard to argue with the sheer amount of content you can fit on the humongous QHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) felt like the underdog coming in, certainly 5" 1080p are 2013 specs not 2014. Still, with good image quality thanks to the high contrast it's performance is more than good. The One (M8) might have even won this category if it was better in bright light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the two phones are very equal, mostly because they have just about every option under the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That includes the standard 2G/3G connectivity in either GSM or CDMA flavor, plus 4G LTE on both. It's Cat. 4 LTE for up to 150Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is even faster with dual-band Wi-Fi going up to 802.11ac, the latest current tech. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 for low-power connectivity to accessories and NFC for quick pairing and tags. Note that neither phone has an NFC manager app out of the box. The HTC One (M8) does not even have NFC in some regions to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two have IR blasters on top to control home equipment and their respective apps both have the option to learn new control signals if you have hardware not available on the long lists of supported devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Remote control app has a cool feature that wakes the phone up as soon as you pick it up, so you don't have to unlock the phone each time you want to change the channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's QRemote, however, has a richer database of devices and can control air conditioners too. It has an option to automatically pop up on your lockscreen and in your notification area when you are at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two flagship smartphones can also be the ones playing the video, not just controlling other players. Here the two differ - LG uses SlimPort, while HTC uses MHL. Both can be converted to regular HDMI with the proper converter or just a microUSB-to-HDMI cable if your TV supports the standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that if you are to get an adapter, SlimPort doesn't require plugging a power source into the adapter itself, unlike MHL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA and Miracast are available for wireless streaming of multimedia too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the microUSB ports for a second, they are both the predominant USB 2.0 kind, no USB 3.0 here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For positioning, the two support GPS and GLONASS but the HTC One (M8) also has a barometer, which will help to speed up the first position lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Unless you demand SlimPort or think the faster lock times with a barometer are vital, there's really nothing to separate the LG G3 and HTC One (M8) in this section.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 may be thinner and lighter but it packs a larger battery than the HTC One (M8), 3,000mAh vs. 2,600mAh respectively. The LG also has a user-accessible battery so you can always carry a spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the endurance rating of both flagship smartphones is nearly equal, in fact the LG G3 lasts less than its opponent by a couple of hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not due to poor performance in the talk time department, that's for sure. The LG G3 lasts over a day of straight talking time, while the HTC One (M8) lasted five hours less.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>However, this is where LG G3's victories end. The HTC One (M8) posted 9 hours on the web browser test, while the LG G3 couldn't make it to 7 hours. One (M8) result is great, while the LG G3 time was very disappointing - there are a handful of old flagships (Galaxy S III, Xperia Z1) that do worse, but all other 2014 flagships do at least 9 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And most of them have less than 3,000mAh in their tanks, only the Sony Xperia Z2 matches the LG in capacity and that one lasted nearly twice as long.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things were a lot closer in the video test, but the LG G3 clearly lost. The HTC One (M8) outlasted it by an hour, as do the Galaxy S5 and the Xperia Z2 by 2 hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not that you'd ever watch video on your phone for 10 hours straight or talk for 25 hours but keep in mind those are cumulative times. That means you'll never get to do 6 hours 40 minutes of web browsing with the LG G3 over several days as standby alone (not to mention the other features) will have drained the battery by a few percent while you sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know what you're thinking - since we do the tests with the brightness slider set at 50%, the screens of the two phones were at different brightness. The HTC One (M8) put out close to 250 nits, while the super sharp LG G3 barely managed 110 nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At less than half the brightness, the LG G3 should have had a massive advantage in power management (remember that it has 15% more battery capacity to boot). So what went wrong?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end the 71 hour endurance rating doesn't convey what the difference is in terms of battery life between the two. True, it uses more energy in standby but the HTC One (M8) will offer excellent battery life, especially if you browse and watch videos more than you talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 will let you talk till your mouth is dry, but checking sites too often will mean having to charge it at the end of the next day instead of the day after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget that our endurance rating is based on the following use pattern - an hour each of talking, browsing and videos every day. If you have a different pattern, check out our Battery life table where you can input your own numbers (this is available in the individual spec pages too!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). Not what we expected at all, we didn't think the margin will be this big, especially with the One (M8) ahead. It lasts longer when the screen is on and that's at a higher brightness setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dropping it to LG G3's 100 or so nits would push its advantage further, meaning LG's new darling lost this chapter by quite a margin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having indulged in skeumorphic UIs, both LG and HTC switched to modern, flat designs. HTC did it a few versions of Sense UI ago, while LG is debuting its flat look with the G3. Comparing the two side by side you'll find plenty of similarities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the lockscreen, the similarities become apparent. Both can be unlocked by a double tap, but the HTC also accepts a swipe up. LG instead promotes Knock Codes, which are similar to pattern lock but with tapping instead of swiping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each lockscreen also supports widgets by default and have a row at the bottom containing several app shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before continuing to the homescreen, a few words about the on-screen buttons. HTC ended its affair with the two-button layout and went back to a standard Back / Home / App switcher setup. This is the default for LG too, but you have the option to add a fourth button and reorder them. Unlike previous Optimus UI iterations, you get a lot more freedom in selecting a custom button order (previous versions just offered four presets and no user-defined setups).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens look fairly similar, stock Android for the most part, and they do share the feature of having a special pane on the left. On Sense that's the BlinkFeed pane, which pulls info from news outlets, social networking updates and notifications from apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In LG's Optimus UI it's the Smart Bulletin on the leftmost pane. It's more restricted than BlinkFeed and only shows notifications from the LG Health app and smart tips. You can hide either of these categories or disable Smart Bulletin altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another "smart" feature is Smart Notice, a Google Now type of widget. It shows cards that display various reminders: to add a contact you called recently or to call someone back, a birthday reminder, a weather alert plus LG Health updates will all show up here. Notice also watches over your phone and will suggest turning on Battery saver when it runs low on juice and will offer to remove downloaded files and apps that haven't been used in months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area of Sense UI on the HTC One (M8) is identical to stock Android, topped with a few extra options. LG meanwhile went to town and added a row of quick toggles, a row of shortcuts, two sliders and the actual notifications begin only halfway down the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that these are all fully customizable - the selection and order of quick toggles can be tweaked, the two sliders (Brightness and Volume) can be hidden individually and the row of shortcuts can be disabled (they are part of the QSlide feature, more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, both companies went for the same style app switcher - tiled app thumbnails, three on a row. This arrangement has the upside that it fits more apps on the screen. The downside in HTC's implementation is that you can't scroll so nine is all the apps you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG switched to side-swipes for terminating app so you can scroll up and down to view more apps. There are buttons to dismiss all apps or to enable Dual Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual Window is one of two multitasking methods offered by the LG G3. It works like Samsung's Multi Window by splitting the screen in two and giving each half to a supported app. We say "half" as that's the default split but you can move the divider to any proportion you like. Recently coupled apps will be remembered so you can easily relaunch them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's QSlide, LG's previous attempt at multitasking. It's similar to Sony's Small apps and runs apps in small, floating windows that can be moved around. You can even reduce their opacity to keep an eye on whatever's going on below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts in the notification area launch the QSlide apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have additional homescreen options. The HTC One (M8) offers Car mode and Kid mode, while the LG G3 has EasyHome and Guest mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides a simple Guest mode, the G3 also features Content Lock, which hides sensitive files (like Galaxy S5's Private mode) by using 128-bit encryption. Files in both the internal memory and the microSD card are protected even if you plug the phone into a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Kill Switch that re-implements Google's Android Device Manager (available on all Androids, including the One). It can make the LG G3 ring so you can find it and, if it's not under the couch, it will let you erase all data on the phone. It also promises anti-virus scans, which doubles another Google feature (the Play Store periodically scans your installed apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. The larger screen favors multitasking, augmented by features such as split-screen and floating apps. The Smart and security features also made a good impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense UI is better than ever and is certainly a viable option. It lacks some polish (the app switcher could've been better) but BlinkFeed is a great tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While both phones use Snapdragon 801 chipsets, Qualcomm's model numbers show the chipsets aren't the same. The MSM8975AC of the LG G3 features a higher clockspeed for its four Krait (2.5GHz), compared to the MSM8974AB (2.3GHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 also packs up to 3GB of RAM compared to 2GB for the HTC One (M8). We say "up to" because the 32GB version has 3GB of RAM, while the more affordable 16GB version has 2GB, putting it on equal ground with the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the QHD screen of the G3 has 78% more pixels than the 1080p screen of the One (M8), which will put more strain on the GPU but also tax the RAM (which is shared between the CPU and GPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The South Korean version we tested is the 3GB/32GB one, while the international version is the 2GB/16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's check how both phones do on the popular BaseMark OS II test. The LG G3 16GB (2GB RAM, int'l) tops the chart and surprisingly, the international version performs much better than the South Korean one one with 3GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to single-core performance, the HTC One (M8) is better, while the LG G3 win at the multi-core test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's see how both phones place in GeekBench 3. The LG G3 is close to other flagships in the pack, while the HTC One (M8) lags a bit behind (as can be expected with its lower CPU clockrate).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu tests the whole system and I found a bigger difference, placing the two flagships at the top and bottom, but with the One (M8) winning this round. This may well be due to the graphics part of the test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Offscreen performance is within a frame, showing that the Adreno 330's in both chipsets are practically equal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In on-screen performance, the LG G3 takes about a 33% hit compared to offscreen results. That's not bad, as we said the difference in pixel count is more than twice that. Still, games may have to resort to rendering at 1080p internally and upscaling as the Adreno 330 generation really wasn't meant for QHD resolutions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To confirm that, we switched to Epic Citadel (set to Ultra high quality and 100% rendering resolution) and here the HTC One (M8) hit the 60fps software-imposed framerate limit, while the LG G3 managed only about 43fps on average. That's certainly playable, but for fast-paced action games a fluid framerate is more important than resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel (Ultra)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In competition with Samsung, LG modify the internals of the stock Android browser to speed up its JavaScript engine, other companies do this as well. Not HTC though, the One (M8)'s Kraken 1.1 score reveal a comparatively sluggish performance, while the LG G3 comes within striking distance of the other flagships.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BrowserMark 2.1 score is similarly in favor of the G3. Note that this test renders HTML5 pages and the extra resolution on the LG slows it down so the gap is narrower but still there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We run several consecutive tests to make sure we get reliable results. With Epic Citadel in particular we noticed that the LG G3 performance started degrading even after the first run - 43fps is the highest we got but after just four runs it dropped to 27fps. The HTC One (M8) meanwhile held steady.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a heat issue - the chipset gets throttled so that it doesn't overheat. We've run similar tests on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and performance started to degrade only after prolonged play. So this is something to keep in mind, the LG G3 performance is actually lower than the best-case scenario results shown above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were also surprised to see the 2GB Euro version of the LG G3 perform equally well and in some cases beat its 3GB sibling. We haven't tested the 3GB Euro version, but there's no reason it should perform differently than its South Korean twin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). The standard 1080p resolution was a boon for the One (M8) as it enabled noticeably higher framerates in games. The stock browser on the One (M8) could use some work though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 meanwhile showcased close to great performance, but this goes away once it started running into overheating issues.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC's custom Gallery app sorts photos in a Timeline or by Albums or Location. Albums are groups of photos and videos that are created automatically (i.e. camera roll) or manually. Each Album has a Highlight video, an animated slideshow of its contents), that you can edit and add music to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zoe app (which isn't ready yet) will let your friends collaborate and add their own photos to the mix to create an even better Highlights video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG gallery is fairly basic, it's essentially a skinned Android gallery. It features Cloud album integration, Dropbox and Box support, plus LG Cloud and Home Cloud. Both galleries support DLNA but there's no cloud integration in the One (M8) app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the LG G3 hasn't got a dedicated spot in the UI but can be launched from both the Gallery and the file browser. It plays UHD videos with ease and it offers excellent codec support - AVI (DivX, XviD) and MKV (H.264) were no problem at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual enemy of mobile video players - sound - was a nonissue here. The LG G3 readily played AC3-encoded audio that stymies most phones, even flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also supports subtitles with an option to load them manually and control their look - size, color and background. Better still, it supports multiple languages, non-English subtitles are often problematic on mobile video players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) video player similarly lacks a dedicated app and is more limited in its functions as well. It does support AVI and MKV files, but AC3 sound is out of the question. Subtitles are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 music player features the traditional track sorting options and also supports DLNA devices. Like the gallery it supports cloud storage options too so you can easily sync your library across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player features a number of preset music effects including QuadBeat, Bass/Treble/Vocal boosters and a custom 7-band equalizer. It has two rare settings - pitch and playback speed adjustments - but we don't think anyone will actually find that useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) does not have an equalizer, you can only turn BoomSound on or off (and that works only for the headphones). The player supports DLNA and offers some cool visualizations and ways to display lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One (M8) also comes with an FM radio built in, in case you want to listen to a live broadcast (note that the Verizon version doesn't have it). The LG G3 also has FM radio on the international version (but not the South Korean one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. The gallery app is pretty bare bones but the music player was better and the video player was much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe earns the HTC One (M8) points and apps from the Play Store can correct any insufficiencies of the native players.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has turned front-facing speakers into its calling card, even though Sony is trying to muscle in on its territory. Certainly not everyone uses their phone as boombox, but owning a One (M8) will change you - the quality of the sound is similar to what comes out of a laptop so it will take over some music playback duties from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has an orthodox setup - one speaker, on the back. The company seems to have decided to go with power over quantity and the speaker can produce 1W of audio normally, 1.5W with its boost feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 wins in terms of raw sound volume, which is great for notifications and ringers. The stereo speakers on the HTC One (M8) are more conductive to listening to music, but since they are on the front they are less likely to get muffled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out more about our tests and our loudness test in particular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). Again, not everyone listens to music through their phone's speakers but if you do the One (M8) is the phone to do it. The speakers also handle notification duties as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 speaker is louder, but if you put the phone on a table some of that loudness is lost to muffling. Unlike the G2, there's no notification LED on the back so you can't just plop the phone face down and be sure you'll get all audio and visual alerts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This was certainly a game at the highest level. The LG G3 and the HTC One (M8) are among the finest performers as far as audio quality is concerned. The G3 is delivers arguably the cleanest output we have seen to date, while the One (M8) comes a close second in that department, but is unmatched in terms of loudness.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). The G3 has a tiny advantage when it comes to clarity, but that's undetectable outside of the lab. The LG smartphone does have below average volume levels, though, while the One (M8) is a clear leader in that department, which sealed this round.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both cameras have 1/3" sensors, but LG's has more than three times the number of pixels. HTC claims the bigger pixels do better in low lighting conditions, but the company has done nothing to improve the sensor since 2013. If anything, it made things worse by removing the optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 does have stabilization, the OIS+ tech LG used on the G Pro 2. The camera doesn't have a large, new generation sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it should be able to knock the One (M8) on its back regardless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has added something dubbed Laser autofocus - it uses infrared light instead of actual lasers but promises blazing fast autofocus. It works with traditional contrast autofocus and with phase detect autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC doesn't have that, instead it makes use of a second camera that allows it to create shallow depth of field effects with some artistic options and change the focus point after the fact. Virtually all Android cameras can do shallow depth of field thanks to an official Google camera, but LG has its own implementation that can also change the focus point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the difference - since the HTC One (M8) has two cameras, it only needs a single shot to do what it does. The Google camera needs two, while the LG G3 takes several photos. This makes the One (M8) suitable for action shots (the subject will move between shots with the other cameras).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, you can do the effect on any photo while with the other cameras you can only refocus or do shallow DoF if you've shot the photo in the special mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more interesting option lets the HTC One (M8) user control all available settings manually - focus point, shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation and white balance. You can have every control you need overlaid over the viewfinder (including all controls) so you can feel like a pro when setting up a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you're limited by what the hardware can do, but it's an interesting option nonetheless (similar to the custom camera app Nokia made for its Lumia phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on to image quality, we'll make a note of the field of view (FoV) of both cameras. HTC uses a widescreen sensor, meaning the entire shot fits snugly on the phone's screen and on an HDTV. LG uses a traditional 4:3 sensor, meaning you'll have to settle for black bars or cropping on both the phone's screen and on a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) camera has a wider FoV to go with its widescreen format - it's a bit narrower vertically, but it can fit a lot more into the shot horizontally.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 has over three times the number of pixels the HTC One (M8) has, which makes direct comparison more difficult. We tried upscaling the HTC photos to 13MP and downscaling the LG G3 photos to 4MP to put both on even footing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even after the downscale, it's obvious the LG G3 has more per-pixel detail than the HTC One (M8), the upscaled shots just make it much easier to see. Keep in mind that an UHD TV has an 8MP screen, while a WXGA tablet has around 4MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering isn't perfect on either phone, the LG seems to struggle with the reds, while the green is oversaturated. The HTC One (M8) photo is on the dark side (even though it was taken on a bright sunny day), which skews the colors and they are off the mark too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This first crop also shows a good deal of issues for the One (M8) camera - the shadows are underdeveloped and there's noticeable purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next crop is just downscaled to 4MP as we're looking at the difference in highlight and shadow rendering on both phones. The HTC One (M8) preserves more detail in the very bright white clouds, but the shadowed areas of the building are too dark to make out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 meanwhile captured less of the cloud but there's some visible detail in the shadows. Despite the even resolution, the thin vertical bars of the railing on the building (top half of the crop) are clearly visible in the G3 photo and nearly lost to artifacts in the One (M8) photo. There's a noticeable difference in sharpness in the signs and foliage too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back to the purple fringing as it's some of the strongest we've ever seen. We downscaled the LG G3 photos to 4MP so the crops show the same parts of the image. The light, reflective areas show a strong purple color in the HTC One (M8) photo, while the G3 photos are unaffected. This speaks poorly of the lens HTC used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the full size photos we used to make the crops, along with more shots to do your own comparison:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Photo Quality Comparison tool lets you view crops too and you can move around the entire image. There's a scaling option so you can view photos at their native resolution, down or upscale them. The first chart showcases an issue of the HTC image processing where finer detail is plagued by moire patterns - we've seen this effect in real-life photos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second chart features squares, each painted in two colors with very subtle contrast between the two areas. The HTC One (M8) comfortably resolves the lighter squares, but the darker ones become uniform. The LG G3 is the opposite - as we saw with the second crop it pays more attention to the shadows, at the cost of highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third chart is interesting for its many colors and the HTC camera once again produces a darker image, skewing the colors. Its white balance under the artificial lighting is blueish too. The second chart is shot using natural lighting and it shows a slight yellow tint from the LG G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 vs. HTC One (M8) in our Photo Quality Comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. The G3 camera is not perfect, but it's leagues ahead of the HTC One (M8) camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have released a flagship with camera issues commonly associated with lower-end phones - we know the UltraPixel camera stacks up poorly in daylight shots, but the processing needs tuning and the purple fringing means the One (M8) never stood a chance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality - special modes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We tried out several of the additional camera modes, starting with HDR. Again, we've downscaled the photos to 4MP to keep the same elements in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) receives a much-needed boost in the shadows, though it blows out the highlights a bit. The HDR effect is weaker in the LG G3 photos - they improved a bit in the brighter areas and a bit in the shadows, the overall difference can be hard to notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full size HDR on and off photos used for the crops:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've mentioned the refocus and shallow depth of field effects, which are essentially the only weapon the One (M8) camera has. The problem is, it's not very accurate - you often get blurry halos around objects and areas are in or out of focus even though they shouldn't be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tweak the strength of the effect, so we went for about half strength as at full strength the mistakes become all too obvious. Separating objects based on depth can also be done with a number of creative effects. Those aren't 100% accurate either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 can't do artistic effects but it does have an additional "All in focus" option. The DoF effect is generally very weak and not particularly accurate. The biggest problem we encountered is that we can't edit the image after we've shot another - with the HTC you can go back at any time, but LG's camera seems to discard the necessary information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of the reason why the effect is so weak is that the LG G3 camera has a shallow-ish depth of field only at very close distances. The toy soldier in the photos is less than 30cm / 1ft away from the phone but we had to move the focus slider to almost infinity. The HTC One (M8) has the opposite problem - it can't focus on close-by objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the panorama. The HTC One (M8) panoramas are barely over 600px tall, meaning if you view it on a standard HDTV you'll have to zoom in nearly 200% and the One (M8) doesn't have any resolution to spare. The LG G3 panorama meanwhile is over 2000px tall so no zooming is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) also had issues with the stitching - some distant buildings look blurry due to improper arrangement of the multiple shots. The LG G3 photos are a lot cleaner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones feature dual-capture modes where the image from the front and back cameras are combined, picture-in-picture style. You can move the small window around and resize it as need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The LG G3 produces much better panoramas, but its HDR may be too restrained for some people (while others will dislike the over the top HDRs produced by the HTC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) takes photos for refocus/shallow DoF effects quicker than the LG and all photos are available for those effects.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One M8's wider FoV is an advantage in the video department too. We found that going from 1080p mode to 2160p mode on the LG G3 reduces the FoV even further. This is something to keep in mind, if you can't fit everything into the frame, try going to 2160p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC took the One (M8) out of the running when it comes to 2160p video since a 2160p frame is 8MP, while the entire UltraPixel sensor is just 4MP. Yes, the LG G3 records video at a higher resolution than the One (M8) can shoot stills).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've forgiven it if the 1080p video was great - after all few people have the UHD TV required to enjoy a 2160p video. The reality, however, is disappointing. You can see that the HTC One (M8) video isn't a match for even the 1080p mode of the LG G3 - the "VIVA" text is legible in the LG video and a smudge in the HTC video, which also shows a blue tint and purple fringing yet again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2160p footage blows both 1080p videos out of the water. It has a noticeable yellowish tint though, more noticeable than the LG G3 produces in 1080p mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 videos offer superior dynamic range to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones record 1080p video at 20Mbps using the AVC codec (High@L4.0 profile). The framerate is a smooth 30fps, but the HTC shows a slight advantage over the LG in terms of audio bitrate - 192Kbps over 156Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2160p videos from the LG G3 up the bitrate to 30Mbps and the profile to High@L5.1, but keep the audio bitrate the same. Even so, to our ears the LG G3 captured a fuller sound than the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG is a bit trigger-happy with the continuous autofocus though, which leads to noticeable jelly effect as the camera refocuses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 features optical image stabilization, the so-called OIS+ tech borrowed from the LG G Pro 2. The original HTC One had OIS too, but the successor dropped it, eliminating one of the key advantages the HTC held over some of its competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a video showcasing the optical image stabilization of the G3. The video was shot with both phones held together, with their cameras as close as we could get them to make sure the shake each phone experiences is identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, you can head to our Video Quality Comparison tool for interactive crops in good and low lighting conditions, plus the ISO chart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 (2160p) vs. HTC One (M8) (1080p)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 (1080p) vs. HTC One (M8) (1080p)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. With a 2160p option, better 1080p and optical stabilization the LG G3 video capabilities easily top the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2160p is mostly for prestige these days, but not getting 1080p right means the HTC One (M8) is instantly shown the door. Dropping OIS wasn't one of the smarter moves the company made either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video - low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We shot video in the same low-light conditions as the still photos, again with and without flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 and HTC One (M8) manage comparable detail at 1080p, though the One (M8) footage is darker, with oversaturated colors and the white balance is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 videos are marginally sharper, but if you switch to 2160p mode you certainly get a lot more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the flash on didn't do much for the LG G3, but it threw the white balance off on the HTC One (M8) even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G3. HTC got a lot of things wrong with the One (M8) camera and the lack of 2160p video capture is just the tip of the iceberg. The UltraPixel camera is slightly behind on detail and needs tuning to provide accurate colors, especially with the flash enabled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 has HD Voice where the network supports it and you can enable a number of features to make the audio even better. Noise suppression will reduce background noise from your end, while Voice enhancement lets you hear the other side more clearly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For HD Voice you can also select the Clean or Soft presets to modify the sound. There's also an option to display a Record call button during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional options let the phone block certain numbers from calling you or have this apply to all private numbers, it can also block international calls and certain outgoing calls (e.g. block 700 numbers). Privacy keeper will hide the person's name or all identifying info if you're worried about someone peeking at your screen when you get a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quiet mode can turn off sound and light notifications on a schedule so calls and messages don't disturb you. The corresponding HTC feature is called Do not disturb and can be scheduled too. There's a list of exceptions to make sure important contacts will always get through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 messaging app can block unknown numbers too or messages coming from specific numbers or containing specific phrases. Text Link is a really cool feature that links certain apps to related message content. For example, getting a text about a meeting will bring up the calendar icon so you can easily add an event. A message with an address will link to Maps instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) also has blocking functionality for calls and messages based on the caller/sender number. It can also disable dialing home numbers when you're roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For messages the One (M8) also has a Secure box - it locks away selected texts with a password. Those can later be deleted or moved back to the general inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC flagship utilizes Polaris Office 5, a full-blown Office package. It can view/edit/create Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs and view PDFs. An interesting option lets you export a document as a PDF (all desktop browsers can open PDFs but not .DOCs). You can also annotate the documents with hand-written notes, which also go into the PDF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 meanwhile scrapes by with an app that can only view documents but not edit them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The South Korean flagship comes with both Chrome and an LG-modified browser. That one has a couple of features missing in Chrome - you can save pages for offline reading and you can also capture the whole page as an image you can crop or edit with an app (say the gallery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) also comes with Chrome and a modified stock browser, but HTC only tweaked the appearance of the browser to match the rest of Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Health is an answer to Samsung's S Health. It's not quite as advanced but it can still track your walking, running, cycling, hiking and inline skating. It lets you create a profile with your basic characteristics and set yourself goals. You can view charts with calories burned and distance traveled and compare your results with others in the motivational Weekly ranking screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a similar app borrowed from Fitbit (it's free, you can download it from the Play Store). Besides distance traveled and calories burned, the app can also keep track of what you've eaten and how much water you drank. Fitbit also has a sleep tracking feature, but note that some of the app's features rely on you having a Fitbit device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Backup can save apps, contacts (including linked social accounts), mails and text messages. The data is sent to Google Drive for safe keeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 has a Backup function, but that's hidden in the Settings menu. It stores app data and settings to Google again and will automatically restore the settings of an app you reinstall. You can also schedule local backups with this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones offer to pull data from your old phone, easing your transition to your cool new flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool tool is HTC Guide. It provides useful info that customer support might ask you about right on the Contact Us screen. It also lets you do your own diagnostics (e.g. test the buttons or the light sensor), review power and mobile data usage and monitor the phone's storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks app on the HTC One (M8) lets you create multiple separate lists, including ones hosted on cloud services like Google Drive. It also lets you add a location to each task so you can view on a map whatever there is to do in your area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Tasks app also supports multiple lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: HTC One (M8). LG offers a rich app package out of the box, virtually equal to the HTC in all but one respect - there's no Office document editor. The Polaris Office 5 app to the HTC One (M8) is very capable and enough to tip the scales. HTC Guide is a great idea for non-technical people too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 took the trophy and headed home, but the HTC One (M8) got in its way. On paper the LG G3 is the superior phone - same size, but bigger screen - the first of its kind, better camera, bigger battery. The HTC One (M8) initially only had its aluminum unibody and stereo speakers to give it an edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no denying the LG G3 screen is unique - to fit a 5.5" screen in practically the same space HTC only managed a 5" screen earns the LG team well deserved accolades. They were the first to get a phone with a QHD screen out of the gate too, but the low contrast and poor sunlight legibility are big problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the new flagship was a bit of a letdown too - it's one of the fastest devices around, but certainly not the fastest. Add the overheating issues and the G3 isn't quite the Snapdragon 801 beast it should have been.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither of these are necessarily deal-breakers per se, but we also got poor battery life out of the LG G3. The beefy 3,000mAh battery should have helped the G3 to the top, yet it lagged noticeably behind its opponent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With not one but three areas of major concern we can't help feel the LG G3 shortchanged us on its promises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the LG G3's camera proved emphatically better than the UltraPixel unit of the HTC. It bested it in daylight and low-light photos, videos too. The extra camera options are not enough to save the One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC isn't out of the running though. It offered strong, consistent performance in benchmarks and also a great app package - the multimedia apps could use some work, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with a trip to the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the HTC One (M8) falls hard is the camera, it barely has a leg to stand on. It will struggle to compete with a midrange Android and it's not actually significantly better than the camera on last year's HTC One. The LG G3 camera definitely feels like an upgrade over the G2, while HTC can't draw users in with the promise of better photography than the older, cheaper One model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC marketing could mention the great battery life - the 2,600mAh battery of the One (M8) is nothing to write home about but frugal use of power helped the phone score a decisive victory. There's also the aluminum unibody. We quite like the plastic finish of the LG G3, but not everyone will agree. It's true that plastic feels different than metal, even if you can get it to look the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing speakers will see you playing music out loud on your One (M8) more often than you did with your last non-HTC phone, but unless it becomes a daily habit it's not a huge advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish HTC had made more of an effort to keep the bezels in check as the One (M8) is a large phone. Also, you're essentially limited to Instagram photography, but if you want dependable performance, great build and solid battery life, the HTC One (M8) is on the shortlist of phones to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 meanwhile delivered some disappointments alongside its stunning achievements, but it is essentially the only current Android flagship phone with Optical Image Stabilization. The camera in general is very good, the screen and faux metal body are great if not excellent. If LG would only do something about that battery life.</paragraph>
