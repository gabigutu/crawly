			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 has a single mission ? to reclaim the top spot in Android messengers for Motorola. It has the pedigree and the personality, and with the right upgrades, it seems a lock to become the next all-in-one messenger of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who can blame Motorola? They liked it at the top of the Android food chain and want to relive the good times. Less in a mood to experiment, they know exactly where they?re going and the MILESTONE 2 might well be the phone to get them there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 has the right measure of metal on the outside and beefed up internals ? both hardware and software. There are a few omissions too but not too close to being deal breakers. Here they all are, in a summarized form.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s little missing on the Motorola MILESTONE 2 spec sheet. In actual fact, many of the phone features seem to have a special added quality ? Gorilla Glass for the display, 720p video for the 5MP camera, Wi-Fi hotspot for the fast 3G, DLNA for the Wi-Fi connectivity, Flash for the web browser and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the main focus of the MILESTONE 2 is text-based communication ? from the humble SMS, through email, to Facebook, Twitter and MySpace messaging there?s little that this messenger droid won?t do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Universal inbox is the tool to handle all this. It doesn?t really matter where each message is coming from ? they all end up in the same place with a handy reply button to send back a reply on the corresponding network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll rummage through the box for starters and look at the Motorola MILESTONE 2 from all sides with a due inspection of the screen and keyboard. We?ll look at the rest of the hardware and the software too, but first things first.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola MILESTONE 2 retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes in box with the usual accessories ? a charger, a microUSB cable to be used for both data connections and charging and a one-piece headset. There?s an 8GB microSD card too, which tops the 8GB of built-in memory for a total of 16GB of storage right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except, that?s not quite right ? what we found out after a bit of head-scratching was that the 8GB of inbuilt memory is for apps only, not available to store photos, music or anything else. Just who would fill all that space with apps is beyond us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So don?t get fooled by vague marketing, the supplied 8GB microSD card is all the storage you get for general purposes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola MILESTONE 2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 116.3 x 60.5 x 13.7 mm the Motorola MILESTONE 2 is by all means not small or compact but the available space is well used. The 3.7? FWVGA screen and the four-row QWERTY make for most of the front surface area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 weighs 169 grams and that?s about fair for such a device. In fact, given the solidly built metallic body and the good balance, that heft is welcome.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display and keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3.7? display dominates the MILESTONE 2 front when the slider is closed. The capacitive touchscreen has the highest resolution currently available on a droid phone - 854 x 480 pixels. The sensitivity of the display is top notch but that is to be expected in a capacitive unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen?s image quality is also great with deep blacks (although no AMOLED deep) and good maximum brightness. Viewing angles are excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is the only downside of the display ? it?s quite reflective and at some of the angles the reflected light completely obscures the image on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals the comfortable four-row QWERTY keyboard. The keys are big and bulging in the center making touch typing easier. The backlighting is strong and even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the usual keys, the Motorola MILESTONE 2 keyboard packs some Android shortcuts (OK, back and search keys) plus a shortcut key that activates the voice command.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad on the keyboard is gone, replaced by the more space efficient but just as usable arrow keys. The special keys have expanded to make them easier to use ? the Enter, Shift and Alt keys are double the length of the other keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of special keys, the Alt Lock key will come in handy when entering numbers. This partially fixes the problem of each key having to house two symbols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the numbers are placed at the top row of the keyboard, which might be a little cramped for people with big fingers. Typical for Android messengers, a press-and-hold of the Menu key shows the available keyboard shortcuts: Menu + s for Search, Menu + p for Settings, Menu + n for Notifications, to name a few.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are rather pleased with the design of the Motorola MILESTONE 2. The handset feels rock solid and the rubbery rear provides a nice grip, in addition to looking quite attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four touch-sensitive controls below the display, as typical for the Android platform. The four keys are Back, Menu, Home and Search. They're haptic enabled and very sensitive, so the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there?s the earpiece flanked by the proximity and ambient light sensors plus the notification light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Motorola MILESTONE 2 is pretty bare, the microUSB port being the only element there. There is no protective cap over it to keep away dust and moist. There?s a tiny white LED that indicates charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right are the camera key. The camera key is on the small side but easy enough to hit. It?s a little hard though to tell the difference between a half and a full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the same side and it?s smallish too and a bit stiff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jumping to the top, we find the power/screen-lock key and the 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Motorola MILESTONE 2 features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the dual-LED flash. The lens is unprotected, not even recessed, so you?ll have to take good care to prevent scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is also on the back too and gets muffled when you place the phone on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the cover reveals the 1400 mAh Li-Ion BP6X battery. Quoted at 350 hours of standby time or 6 hours and a half of talk time it certainly sounds like a decent performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It managed to get us through three and a half days of medium use, during which we had Wi-Fi on all the time and tried out basically every feature of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also here but unfortunately it isn't hot-swappable. That means that you will have to power off your MILESTONE 2 each time you change cards. On a positive note, it can handle cards of up to 32GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider run is smooth but it?s not spring assisted so you have to push all the way up. When you do, there?s a click locking the slider into place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Motorola MILESTONE 2 is excellent and the handset's body looks quite durable. The rubbery rear gives a good grip (with weight of 169g, it?s important) and also hides fingerprints. The beveled bottom at the front also plays a role in handling the phone ? it?s the place to put your thumb that both lets you hold the phone steadily and not press any of the touch sensitive keys.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Froyo with MOTOBLUR topping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 runs Android 2.2 Froyo customized with the latest MOTOBLUR 1.5 user interface. It looks mostly the same as the 2.1 Eclair version, but some refinements make it even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, here?s a video of the Motorola MILESTONE 2 and the MOTOBLUR interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has kept the cornerstone of Android ? the homescreen ? but they?ve laced it with social networking integration. This is done mostly through widgets, so if you?ve used Android before you?ll get the hang of it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are seven homescreen panes, so you have plenty of room for widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few handy shortcuts are available through the Home key ? a single tap brings you to the central homescreen. A double tap of the Home key, launches an app of your choice (by default it activates voice command).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts and folders have been part of the Android homescreen from the very start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are the bread and butter of the homescreen. And Motorola has worked some of their mojo to add excellent social networking and make the widgets resizable. Tap and hold on a widget and four handles will appear in the corners ? you can drag them to resize the widget, which will change its appearance to fit the new size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, the Date and Time widget can be expanded to show a clock and a calendar or shrunk to time and date or even all the way down to just a clock. With this much flexibility, you can take the most out of what initially seems like a small and limited screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MOTOBLUR provided widgets include Social and Status widgets, Messages, Quick Contacts, Weather, Radio Switches, RSS Reader, Connected Player controls, Sticky Notes and various application shortcuts. The regular Google widgets are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign single or double quick contacts. The single ones are as simple as a contact photo (you tap to email, text or call), while the doubles contain two shortcut buttons below the picture. There is an option for one-touch dialing too (it will ask you the first time when you tap on the quick contact).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social widgets have a dedicated chapter coming up, while the rest of them are pretty much standard. It?s worth repeating perhaps that all of the widgets can be resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is intact. It shows status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is Profiles ? it is similar to HTC?s Scenes and lets you create three Profiles. In each profile, you can organize the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) however you want and those changes will be preserved, letting you switch quickly between the different setups. By default, the three Profiles are called Home, Work and Weekend (though you can rename those).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the Motorola MILESTONE 2 you press and hold the Home key, just like on any other Android phone. The task switcher is a shortcut to access six of the most recently used apps, but it?s not a task manager per se.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has included a capable Task manager too ? you can end apps one by one or you can add apps to the Auto-end list, which kills the apps on the list the moment the screen switches off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 has a 1GHz CPU and 512MB RAM, which puts it in the higher-end of the droid performance spectrum. We ran our usual tests and here?s how it did versus the HTC Desire Z, another QWERTY-packing side-slider.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLUR-red phonebook with social skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A MILESTONE 2 phonebook can store a serious amount of information about your contacts. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is, of course, an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing the contact list, you can swipe right to reveal the History ? a list of all recent communications with all contacts. Alternatively, a left swipe displays all recent status updates from all contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This swipe magic is available when viewing individual contacts too ? in this case only history and status updates for that contact are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this to work, you have to link the contact with their Facebook, Twitter, MOTOBLUR address book or Gmail accounts. This gets done in a second ? tap the menu key, Link contact and pick the appropriate account (those are pulled automatically from the services you?re logged on to).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with noise cancelation and pocket detection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 had no issues with reception and the in-call sound was clear and acceptably loud. The phone has the proprietary CrystalTalk technology, which is not only a software or DSP enhancement. A real secondary mic makes sure none of the background noise interferes with your call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several settings for the Voice quality ? Standard, Balanced, Bright or Extra bright. They change how the voice sounds ? louder, crisper, more bass and so on. They really change how the voice of the other caller sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 offers smart dialing (searching both numbers and names) but you can also use voice commands, which can call a contact (or dial a number you dictate), redial, send a message (using voice input), open an app or a contact or even play a certain music playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 offers In-pocket detection, which locks the device when it detects that it?s in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another telephony feature is the Caller ID Readout, which can speak out the name of the caller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola MILESTONE 2. It scored ?Average?, meaning you could miss some calls in noisier environments. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Universal inbox blurs the messaging lines<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All text-based communication on the Motorola MILESTONE 2 is handled in the Messaging app. It combines a standard text messaging, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter along with the Universal inbox, which combines the messages from all those sources into a single, chronologically ordered list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department is standard Android stuff ? threaded messaging is enabled and the message composer has a neat and simple interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the contact photo is placed on top and messages are displayed as speech bubbles (the newest message is placed at the bottom). Overall it looks like an IM app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tap-to-compose box starts off with a single line but it will expand to three lines if needed. A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. If you press-and-hold on the text cursor it will launch the magnifying glass instead, which lets you position the cursor with high accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 lets you preset the number of messages recorded in each thread. Once that number is exceeded the oldest message gets deleted. Delivery reports are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. You can enable push email or schedule automatic updates. There?s an option to sync only over Wi-Fi, which is sure to save you some mobile data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app does an excellent job at mimicking the Gmail app carrying over all its cool features (batch operations and the rest). It also supports Push notifications, which instantly notify you of a new email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Universal inbox uses the same UI as the generic email client but it doesn?t limit itself to just one method of communication ? it lists text messages, emails and Facebook and Twitter messages all at once (though you can switch off some of those, if you want). Batch operations are supported here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap the compose button, you are prompted to select which service should be used to send a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Universal inbox is great ? the only thing we missed was some sort of filtering or message ordering options to manage the huge number of messages that will end up in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll cover the Facebook and Twitter sections of the Messaging app when we discuss the social networking features of the Motorola MILESTONE 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already covered the keyboard-based text input but there?s Swype too if you want to quickly enter a short text without having to slide open the hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MOTOBLUR spreads on the gallery too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes with a custom Gallery app (with cool 3D effects, reflections and smooth animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery is split into sections ? Camera roll (shows the most recent photos you?ve snapped), Folders (combines all folders from the memory that contain photos or videos), All Photos and All Videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the regular view modes, there?s the 3D landscape view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smooth animations sure are eye-catching but grid view is much better for browsing a large collection of photos. Turn the phone on its side and it will switch to grid view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zooming is also available but you can use double tap too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick upload and Share features offer quick sharing via MOTOBLUR Share (on Facebook, MySpace, Picasa, Photobucket, etc.) and also Email apps, Bluetooth and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some quick editing tools ? rotate, crop, resize and brightness/contras/color controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mixing social and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player on the Motorola MILESTONE 2 takes the same approach as the Messaging app ? it puts all the music related things in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Music is the basic music player ? it plays songs from your memory card and it can filter tracks by artist, album, playlists and so on. A cool feature automatically pulls album art for the track and ? get this ? the song lyrics, which are displayed in sync with the song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This turns the MILESTONE 2 into a mini karaoke (of course, it needs an Internet connection). But there is more. You can select the language of the lyrics ? the song?s native language or any other, an awesome feature!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the screen reveals the scrubber. You can send a blip ? a quick ?Love it? or ?Hate it? message on Twitter, SMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another cool option too ? you can see who is listening to your current track and where they are around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Videos section of the Music app offers quick searches on YouTube or GoTV for music videos (what else?). Community taps into the social networks to find you some new music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view TuneWiki charts, Music Maps (sort of location-aware ?currently playing? feature) and HOT Playlists, which show the most popular songs on Facebook or Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes with a song ID feature, as well ? tap the button and in seconds you?ll know the name of the song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing though. The equalizer presets are uncomfortably stored deep in the phone?s setting menu. There are only a handful of preset settings available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing is there?s a nice selection of effects when the headphones are connected ? 3D stereo and three surround settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no FM radio in the Motorola MILESTONE 2 ? just an Internet radio, but that requires a live internet connection and probably a good data plan, if you listen to it on-the-go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Mileston3 2 did quite impressively in our audio quality test. As a matter of fact, the handset is certainly among the Top 3 we have tested, when used with an active external amplifier (such as a home or a car stereo). In that scenario the handset is really loud and achieves great readings all over. From signal-to-noise ratio through dynamic range and stereo crosstalk - it's all bordering on perfection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the output takes quite a big hit when headphones are connected and the Motorola Milestone 2 gets relegated from a great to a mere decent performer. The stereo crosstalk and loudness suffer the most, but the intermodulation distortion rises significantly too. There are even some deviations in the frequency response, though they are hardly anything to worry about. The result is decent, but far less spectacular output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player plays 720p, codec support is shaky<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player itself is pretty basic. You can pick a video from the Gallery (with the cool 3D wall and everything) and tap play, there?s not dedicated app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for codec support, most XviD videos played (though a few didn?t) and there was only one DivX video that would play fine ? but it was a 720p video. Some bug caused it to stop playing and we had to restart the phone to fix it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP4 and 3GP files were not a problem, the Motorola MILESTONE 2 played them trouble free up to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a simple video editor ? you can add a title in the beginning and trim the video. You can also resize the video and remove the audio, but there?s no option to string together several videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 packs a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum resolution of 2592&#x445;1936 pixels. There is a dual-LED flash too, but don?t expect miracles in low-light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is perfectly simple ? a resolution indicator, a counter with the remaining shots and a virtual shutter. A tap on the screen reveals the Gallery shortcut (with a preview of the last shot taken), Scenes, Effects and Flash keys plus a camcorder switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus point is initially on the center of the screen but you can drag it around to change the focus. It works similarly to touch focus but you have to drag the point, you can?t just tap to move it to a new location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s face detection which can improve portrait shots and also a panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes and effects are selected from a cool menu ? the name of the scene (or effect) along with its icon are displayed and you can change them by swiping left or right. As you do that, the viewfinder displays a live preview of the scene/effect results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom tags are a handy feature to keep photos organized ? you can add a tag, say ?holiday 2010? and it will remain active between sessions until you delete it (at the end of the holiday). Adding and removing tags is fast and easy. There?s an automatic location tag too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, when it comes to the actual product of the Motorola MILESTONE 2 camera - the photos - we're quite pleased with the image quality. There's plenty of resolved detail, the colors are also nicely saturated and the images are quite punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the same time though, there's some aggressive noise reduction, often smearing fine detail away there and it even doesn?t eliminate all of the chromatic noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Motorola MILESTONE 2 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how-to-use guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 can record 720p at 30 frames per second. It doesn?t quite reach 30fps (videos usually hover around 28fps) but more importantly they look very smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in .3GP format, which generally means poor quality, but the amount of captured detail is good. If the lighting of the scene is not constant, the MILESTONE 2 will try to adjust, which often results in annoying pulsation of lighter and darker exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another issue is that the focus is fixed ? there?s no autofocus before or during shooting ? so shooting closer objects will be impossible. Overall, it?s not perfect but the MILESTONE 2 video camera still produces very decent results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s. You have access to the same effects but only two scenes ? auto and night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p@30fps video sample from the Motorola MILESTONE 2.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 has great connectivity features ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE fast dual-band 3G with 7.2Mbps downlink speeds and 2Mbps HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity features include Wi-Fi b/g/n (with DLNA support), Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and a microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can connect the MILESTONE 2 to a computer in several modes ? USB Mass storage, None (useful, the Mass storage mode locks up the card, so you can?t use many apps), Windows media sync and ?Portal and tools?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only the microSD card shows up in Mass storage mode, the internal memory is not accessible. As it turned out, that 8GB slab of an internal memory is only available as a system-reserved storage ofr installing third-party apps. Not that we mind the extra leg room, but generally anything more than 1GB can probably be considered as an overkill. And imagine having the rest 7GB of wasted internal storage, reserved for a use, you?d never need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 connectivity is bolstered by DLNA functionality, which lets you share media from the phone and play media from remote devices too. Also of importance (and standard for Android 2.2) is the Wi-Fi hotspot, which shares the phones 3G connection with Wi-Fi connected devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone portal app however was the most impressive part of the connectivity package. It practically lets you browse the phone?s contents on your desktop browser. You can connect over USB or via Wi-Fi ? once you start it, the MILESTONE 2 will give you an IP address to type in the computer?s browser and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even password-protect the connection. From then on, you can browse photos and files (the file browser works only with Internet Explorer though), adjust settings and also manage contacts ? including composing and sending messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The idea is great ? you don?t always need the full functionality of a PC Suite (the Phone portal can do quite a bit) and you can?t always have the PC Suite installed on the computer you?re using.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser with Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve established time and again that Android has a good browser and the Android 2.2 version is one of the most capable ones around, complete with true Adobe Flash 10.1 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is completely minimalist (it?s the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar and a bookmarks shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 supports two zoom methods in the browser: double tap and the multi-touch pinch zooming. Text reflow is available and makes reading desktop websites very easy on the comparatively small mobile screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The excellent multi-page support is still available and the rendering algorithm is basically flawless. Panning and zooming are pleasingly fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of its Froyo peers, the MILESTONE 2 supports Adobe Flash 10.1 in the web browser. We tried out a couple of Flash games and they worked really smooth. Sites like Kongregate offer mobile versions with Flash games optimized for touchscreen play ? you don?t have to rely solely on the Android Market for entertainment (tip: a tap on a Flash element opens it in full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube worked too, of course, as did Vimeo and other video sharing sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A social focus with MOTOBLUR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The custom MOTOBLUR UI on the Motorola MILESTONE 2 does a great job of integrating social networking with the rest of the phone features. We?ve already seen the socially-enhanced phonebook with status updates, the gallery with easy upload to social networking sites, and the SNS-enabled music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also there are lots of social widgets on the homescreen and even a couple of dedicated apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is Social Networking ? the app behind the eponymous widget. It can display status updates from all your social networks (or just the ones you pick) and it can be used to set your status on some or all social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t offer much in the way of browsing profiles ? you can add comments, post on the Wall and like a profile, but to view the full profile you?ll need to use the browser. Not much of a problem, the browser is quite up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between Social Networking and the Social Status widget is that while SN is primarily for reading status updates, the Social Status is for posting. It can also display the last status updates you?ve posted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app (which we already covered) has support for both Facebook and Twitter along with the traditional text messages and email. Its main job is sending messages between contacts more than posting general status updates. The Universal inbox is the go-to place for all one-to-one communication as it combines the messages from all the services in the Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks deceptively similar to the SMS messaging UI. It displays conversations in threaded view, with speech bubbles when viewing a single thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is great, because it makes sending texts no different than sending a tweet or a Facebook message. On most other phones, the two things are separate concepts with separate UIs altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status? live folder is also here ? it?s small and space efficient, but when you tap it, it expands to fill the screen with the latest status updates from your preferred social networks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office document editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its Android siblings, the Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes with a rich set of organizer features and a document editor ? a must for a smartphone that means business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is their app of choice and it has support for viewing and editing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, including Office 2007 docs). Viewing PDF files is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It text is readable even at low zoom levels and the 1GHz CPU makes quick work of reformatting the text to fit the new zoom level. Typing is fast too and there are options to format the text (font, text size, style and color, but no text alignment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t create tables in Word documents and Quickoffice even had issues editing the text in a table. The Excel editor (called Quicksheet) also had omissions ? you can enter a formula and it will work, but there?s no formula wizard to simplify formula creation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Quickpoint (the PowerPoint editor) is useful for quick fixes only ? you can edit text but you can?t add new slides or much else (e.g. add or delete a new image).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice aside, the MILESTONE 2 calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. It is also integrated with the status bar and also offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A file manager is one of the first apps you download from the Market ? except there?s no need to do that with the MILESTONE 2 as Motorola have included the capable Files app. It can handle files and folders in bulk with the standard set of file management tools (copying, renaming, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 features a decent alarm clock application, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the YouTube app is easier to use than the YouTube site, considering the relatively small display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and navigation with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes with a GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in about a minute with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the titular application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in any of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our MILESTONE 2 came with Maps 4.5 but if you update it to version 5, you?ll get access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off your course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MILESTONE 2 is on the list of devices that support all features of Google Maps 5.0 ? 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market updated, looks much better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola MILESTONE 2 comes with a FWVGA screen and Android Froyo, so the number of incompatible apps is very low ? it?s practically at the top of the smartphone food chain. The Market gives you access to over a hundred thousand apps, many of which are well-made and very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only restriction that may not be so obvious at first is that you have to live in one of the supported countries to get the paid apps. If you don?t, then you won?t even see them listed. The community has already found a hack for that (a little app called Market Enabler) but that would only show you the hidden paid apps. It won?t allow you to buy them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? a carousel of featured apps on top and below them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can recognize the latest version of the Android Market by the big green carousel header. It sure is eye-catching but also takes up a lot of space. Also it?s a little redundant ? it?s a featured list of apps, below which is another featured list. Luckily, once you get down to the individual sections of the Market, the carousel disappears replenishing the screen space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app detail pages have been redesigned as well and usability has improved. The install button has been moved to the top ? the button is fairly big and prominent and it states if the app is free or how much it costs otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the new version of the Market also brings down the trial time (the time in which you can uninstall your newly downloaded app and get a full refund) down to the measly 15 minutes. We get it, 24 hours was quite a lot before, but something in the sorts of 2 hours is way more reasonable than 15 minutes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Great phones are never good at just one thing. The Motorola MILESTONE 2 can do a lot and it can do it right for a lot of different users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The comfortable keyboard and full set of messaging features will appeal to business users. The social networking support will please the social buff and the sturdy metallic frame and scratch-resistant display will be appreciated by all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?re not many negative things to say about the hardware ? we didn?t quite like the slider and the 8GB of internal memory being limited to apps but that?s it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software package is pleasingly rich ? the preloaded apps will be enough for most people. Motorola has put a lot of thought and effort into refining MOTOBLUR and the end result provides a robust messaging experience, regardless of the network or service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should bear in mind though that all recent Android smartphones by Motorola come with a locked bootrom so rooting or tinkering with the MOTROOLA 2 at system level is not possible right now. Motorola doesn?t like its customers to mess with the software on their phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company also advises you to buy the handset for its current software and features and not rely on future Android updates as they are not certain for all versions, models and regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it a bit easier for the new MILESTONE 2, finding a high-end messaging droid is a bit of a challenge these days. So you really don?t have many options if you?re after a hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious competitor is the HTC Desire Z. 3.7? WVGA screen, four-row QWERTY, Froyo with Sense UI and 5MP camera with 720p make it a perfect match. The Desire Z also has an aluminum unibody going for it along with the HTC Locations SatNav software that comes preinstalled. It offers map offline mode but voice-guided navigation comes for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original MILESTONE still has decent features by today?s standards and its price has fallen with time, making it a viable alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire Z ? Motorola MILESTONE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?d agree to an OS switch, the Symbian^3 powered Nokia E7 is a solid option with its 4? nHD screen using the new ClearBlack technology and Gorilla Glass protection plus free life-time navigation, plus 16GB true internal storage and HDMI port. This one is not yet available but should hit the market pretty soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Windows Phone 7 camp there?s the HTC 7 Pro with specs to match the Motorola MILESTONE 2. Windows Phone 7 has great Office integration and SNS support, even though 3rd party availability will be limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E7 ? HTC 7 Pro ? LG C900 Optimus 7Q ? BlackBerry Torch 9800</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E7 and 7 Pro are yet to be released ? but the LG C900 Optimus 7Q Windows Phone 7 phone is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, no collection of business phones is complete without a BlackBerry. The touchscreen/QWERTY slider combo of the BlackBerry Torch 9800 and the trademark BlackBerry services certainly make it a contender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All these options are good, but the Motorola MILESTONE 2 is a no-regrets phone. With solid build and excellent software, it will do everything you want it to and do it better than most.</paragraph>
