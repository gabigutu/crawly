			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG had a handful of devices announced ahead of the MWC, which we got to handle. More announcement have yet to be made though. We're at the event right now and we'll be bringing more stuff as it becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, LG is making a big deal of its new knock codes - a unique way to unlock smartphones with a level of security similar to pattern unlock. The only new announcement so far is the entry-level F70, which is very similar to the L70. The LG L III series, the G Pro 2 and the LG G2 mini had all been announced before the MWC began. Even the LG G Flex is here, with its large, curved screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the LG G Pro 2 isn't new, it's the first time we've seen it in person - we even took it out to snap a few camera samples, including 4K videos. It's the first time we've handled the LG G2 mini too and its lightweight design impressed us, but the phone has a lot to live up to with that flagship name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't get a chance to touch the L70 and L40, but this is barely the first day of the MWC (officially, it starts tomorrow), so if we get a chance we'll give those two a spin too. The L70 is fairly similar to the F70 and you can read our first impressions on page 4, followed by the L90.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G Pro 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 went official 10 days prior to the MWC. It's already selling in Korea, with US and Europe getting it in March and April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pro 2 is the successor of the Optimus G Pro phablet and upgrades all major specs. It comes with a larger 5.9" 1080p IPS display, runs on the Snapdragon 800 chipset with 3GB of RAM, and comes with a 13MP camera with enhanced optical image stabilization (OIS+).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pro 2's display looks great, colors are punchy, the viewing angles are OK too, though the performance under direct sunlight is rather unimpressive. Still the display occupies 77.2% of the entire front, the bezels are impressively slim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other key features of the LG G Pro 2 are expandable 16 or 32GB of internal storage, 4K video recording @30 fps, 1080p videos @ 60fps and 720p@120fps. The phablet is powered by a 3,200mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Pro 2 is running Android 4.4.2 KitKat skinned with LG's proprietary Emotional UX. The phablet also introduces the so-called Knock Code - allowing device unlock by a combination of taps on the screen. We tried this feature and liked it, though it takes some time to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video demo of LG's latest software:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 is made entirely of plastic. Its back has barely visible pattern, and is glossy and very slippery. We expected to find fingerprints and smudges all over the G Pro 2 after handling the phablet for a while, but as it turns out it is not affected too badly, never mind the glossy finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the G Pro 2 has the already familiar control deck just below the camera - a Power/Lock key squeezed between the volume keys. Those can be configured to launch different apps (such as the camera) upon a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've taken the LG G Pro 2 out for a quick spin. We were eager to test its OIS camera, so we snapped e few photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a full 13MP 4:3 photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also shot two short 4K videos with the LG G Pro 2. The first we uploaded to YouTube for convenience, the second is available for download untouched. Enjoy!</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K video sample</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll keep our comments on the quality for the retail review unit, but the G Pro 2 camera indeed looks promising.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 mini hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not to fall behind the curve, LG also showcased a "mini" version of its flagship smartphone. However, it's not a monster hiding in a smaller shell, but rather a midrange smartphone that doesn't overshadow the LG G2, but complements it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 mini keeps the cool rear button layout with the volume rocker surrounding the Power/Lock key. The trio of buttons sits below the 8MP camera lens, which has a LED flash on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is a 4.7" unit of qHD resolution, which is a bit disappointing, to be honest - 720p would've suited it more. The display quality is reasonable still, with good color reproduction and nice contrast. LG has kept the ultra slim bezels on the G2 mini, making it smaller than you'd expect from a 4.7 incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the phone is a breeze. It weighs 121 grams and feels very solid in the hand. Its 9.8mm of thickness is little disappointing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all the physical keys at the back, the sides are stripped of any buttons. At the bottom of the phone, there's a pair of grilles, but only one actual speaker. Behind the other grille lies a microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two versions of the LG G2 mini, giving you a choice between a Snapdragon 400 or Nvidia Tegra 4i chipset. Both will have 1.2GHz quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM. Non-LTE versions will also be available, as well as a dual-SIM variant. The compact smartphone will be available in a variety of colors: Titan Black, Lunar White, Red, Gold. The selection is region dependent though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG F70 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG F70 has a 4.5" display of WVGA (480 x 800) resolution and runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat with LG's customizations on top. LG is marketing it as a very affordable LTE device and has implemented the new knock code unlock, which works nicely with one hand. There's also the LG Guest Mode feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display offers nice colors and acceptable viewing angles. There's a physical home button and two capacitive keys to get you around the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by Snapdragon 400 with four 1.2 GHz cores. There's a 2440mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic is fingerprint-prone and glossy, but doesn't look cheap and there's some texture to it for a reasonably secure grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 5MP camera on the back and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG F70 supports LG's Quick Window flip case - the screen can be operated even when covered.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG L90 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG L90 has taken charge of the new LG Series III. Its 4.7" IPS LCD display is of qHD resolution resulting in a pixel density of 234ppi. The display itself boasts nice colors and viewing angles, but contrast isn't particularly great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, there's a physical Home button sitting between a back and menu capacitive keys. On the dual SIM version, there's no physical Home button, but four capacitive ones - back, home, menu and dual SIM manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L90 is made of plastic, with a silver strip on the side that goes around the entire phone. The back cover has an interesting texture. It's not too grippy though, but does a good job of hiding fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is removable and reveals a 2,540mAh battery. No web browsing and talk time is officially quoted. The LG L90 is running Android 4.4 KitKat on a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8226 chipset with 1.2GHz quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features an 8MP camera with LED flash, with a 5MP front camera for video conferencing. At 131.6 x 66 x 9.7 mm, the LG L90 is a bit on the thick side and is certainly not a small phone. However, single-handed use isn't a chore and the new Knock Code unlock is of course enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone holds the Power/Lock key, with a volume rocker opposite. The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top and looks stylish with the silver frame running around the L90.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expect more information the LG L90 as it comes in.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG L70 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG L70 is actually the third generation LG Optimus L7. It seems LG has decided on shortening the LIII series, which is actually a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L70 looks a lot like the LTE-enabled F70, it is even built around the same 4.5" IPS WVGA display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L70 rely on a different platform though. Instead of a quad-core Snapdragon 400 as it was with the F70, the L70 relies on the Snapdragon 200 with a dual-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 302 GPU and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG will be offering different versions of the L70. Depending on the market your L70 will either come with a 5MP on the back or with an 8MP snapper. There will also be a Dual SIM option, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is made entirely of plastic, but it has a rough-textured battery cover that is not prone to fingerprints or smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L70 offers great grip and is a pleasure to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the L70 runs on Android 4.4 KitKat, which thanks to the latest Google optimizations, seems really snappy even on the not-so-hot Snapdragon 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L70 is supposed to launch next month, but the pricing is yet to be detailed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG L40 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG L40, a.k.a. Optimus L4 III, is the last and most compact of the new LIII series. It will be available next month in dual and triple SIM versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L40 packs a 3.5" IPS HVGA display with 165ppi density. It is powered by the Snapdragon 200 chipset with a dual-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 302 graphics and 512MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also 4 gigs internal storage expandable via a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L40 has a 3MP fixed-focus snapper on its back for some quick shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the L70, the L40 is an all-plastic phone. It has the same rough-textured back, so fingerprints and smudges won't be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.4 KitKat is in charge of operations, so hopefully the L40 will be lag free even when it operates with three SIM cards.</paragraph>
