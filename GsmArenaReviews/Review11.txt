		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took a while before mobile phones became portable not only in name. At one point, small size alone made a phone something special. Calling and texting were all there was and twelve buttons were nonnegotiable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those times seem prehistoric now that a contemporary smartphone is expected to do all but the dishes. There we are ? 3.7? touch screens are now the norm. It sounds like pushing the limits of portability but most people won?t mind as long as there?re virtually no limits on functionality. With nearly desktop-like browsing, video and TV ? displays are only supposed to get better, crisper? and bigger. Who would want it the other way? Small touchscreen doesn?t make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, everyone?s entitled to an opinion. And Sony Ericsson are keen to disagree. Small touchscreen may be against the simple logic, but just don?t rush to judgment yet. Not till you?ve seen the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. It has more smartphone powers than most users will ever need. It?s a little sweetie, and it?s cool and gadgety too. Just don?t let the size fool you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, long story short, crowds probably won?t be flocking to the shops to replace their full-sized XPERIA X10 units for the mini version. The X10 mini doesn?t have it all and isn?t the ultimate smartphone, but all is not what everyone needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X10 mini is easy on your pocket ? and we don?t just mean size. The phone uses less expensive hardware ? low-res screen, a midrange CPU. But if you think of it, it?s not just blatant cost-cutting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It looks like they made the right choices and in the end you don?t have to pay for something you cannot use anyway. Anything higher than QVGA wouldn?t have made much difference on a 2.55? screen (which is the most you can fit in a phone this small really). Anything faster than the 600 MHz Qualcomm CPU is simply unnecessary given the low pixel count.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A so-so retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nice surprises are what we like to find inside the boxes of the phones that we review, but unfortunately the X10 mini didn't have many of those. On the other hand all the essentials are covered so there is not much to whine about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the package, there?s a microUSB cable and a charger. The rest of the contents include a short manual and a 2GB microSD card that comes loaded directly in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset bundled with the XPERIA X10 mini is the Sony Ericsson MH610. It has a standard 3.5mm jack - there's no sign of the Hi-Fi MH810 headset which has a custom jack developed specifically for XPERIA X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also included in the retail package is a rubber case that's designed to be always-on the handset. It covers and protects the sides and back of the XPERIA X10 mini. There's also a screen protector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since XPERIA X10 mini features exchangeable back panels, the retail package comes with a choice of two panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson will be offering a total of six different colors for the back panel. Unfortunately, the back panel availability and retail bundling would be strictly market and even carrier-dependent. In most cases, the phone should come pre-bundled with two of the back panels and users should be able to purchase extra panels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 83 x 50 x 16mm the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini sure is tiny. There is hardly a pocket that won?t find enough free space for it and the mere 88 grams of weight will almost make you forget it is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might frown at the 16mm of thickness which is too much by today?s standards but it doesn?t really make the device unattractive. It almost looks like the boxy appearance was exactly what designers were looking for. Thinner than that and the phone would?ve been near impossible to handle comfortably. And the X10 mini is truly the smallest handset we have had recently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s all a matter of personal taste how you feel about the X10 mini. The boxy handset is quite different than most of its competitors. Manufacturers would usually go for tall slimmer bodies for their touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini won?t earn it many points either, especially against metal-built phones, but it?s decent. The back is nicely fingerprint-resistant with rubbery finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shiny plastic on the front (which remains is black in all color versions) does become greasy with use (it doesn?t take too long) but, since the front is mostly taken by the display anyway, we are willing to let that one go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen itself measures 2.55? in diagonal, which seems like the very minimum that still allows finger-use. Sony Ericsson did well with the interface though, to make the best use of the screen estate. We?ll get back to that later but the icons are all large enough and you won?t have trouble pressing any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen sensitivity, as was to be expected in a capacitive unit, is excellent. The slightest of touches is enough for a click to be registered, for a great touchscreen experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equally important, the QVGA resolution is adequate for this screen size but doesn?t allow too fancy graphics. For example, most of the icon labels don?t look sharp enough and the icons themselves are not as smooth as we?ve seen on HVGA and WVGA Android handsets. We have seen a bit of improvement here compared to the unit we had for our preview, but the X10 mini simply doesn?t have the pixels to draw the graphics as well as some of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 65K-color limitation inherent to Android versions prior to 2.0 could result in the occasional banding but it?s not as easily noticeable on a screen this size. When the X10 mini receives an Android 2.1 update (said to come before the end of the year) those issues might be completely resolved (provided there are no hardware limitations either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is passable as far as TFT displays go, with good brightness and above average contrast. Anyway, an AMOLED display would?ve made sense on the full-grown XPERIA X10 but is obviously too much for the mini league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the X10 mini display is hardly spectacular but it?s still good. There is some loss of contrast but you are still able to operate the handset trouble-free outdoors on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys ? contextual menu, home and back button. Those are thin knobs but nicely raised and with good press feedback. The obvious absentee is the Search button: in exchange there?s a search widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find a status LED, the earpiece and the proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is in charge of locking the display when you hold it next to your face during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is completely bereft of controls. The only thing of interest here is a small groove to pull the battery cover off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right you get a volume rocker and a shutter key. The volume rocker is as good as the three keys below the display but the camera key is a bit too tiny. It still has a proper stroke though and very distinct half press. It?s not bad at all, just needs some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the handset is the screen lock key which also acts as a power button. Again, it isn?t the most comfortable to press but we suspect it was done on purpose to minimize accidental presses. More than often it needs a push with a fingernail really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini has the audio jack and the microUSB port. There is a protective cap over the microUSB port, while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio jack is absolutely compatible with standard 3.5mm plugs (a pair of which is bundled by Sony Ericsson). The unusual shape is supposed to accommodate the Sony Ericsson MH810 headset, which uses a proprietary plug with several more pins needed for the added music controls. The Hi-Fi MH810 headset was made specifically for XPERIA X10 mini but we're not really if it will be bundled in the retail package or it will be sold separately. Our package came along with the Sony Ericsson MH610 headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the XPERIA X10 mini hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. The loudspeaker also goes in here, slightly to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment. The microSD slot is hot-swap enabled but the bad news is the battery isn?t user-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Carrying a back-up battery is out of the question, of course. We guess once the original battery runs its life span Sony Ericsson service center will replace it for you free of charge as long as you buy the new battery from them. Then again, you?re more likely to change your phone long before the battery performance degrades too bad to be a nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is quoted at up to 285 hours of standby and 4 hours of talk time in a 2G network. In 3G mode, it?s up to 360 hours of standby and three and half hours of talk time. The real-life performance was quite good: the handset went on for two days of reasonably heavy use (about 30 minutes of telephony, a dozen of photos and forty-five minutes of fiddling with the other phone features each day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is so tiny you can cup it in your hand and out of sight. It?s brilliant to handle and makes you want to cuddle it. Some users might find awkward making calls on something that small but otherwise working on such limited touchscreen estate is trouble free. There are inevitable compromises of course, like no on-screen QWERTY keyboard, but the little chap sure is hard to resist.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: perfect fit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini runs version 1.6 of the Android platform just like the rest of the X10 gang. There is nothing out of the ordinary but what makes the mini special is the QVGA resolution which is a rare sight in the Android world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness, Android doesn?t look as pretty on 320 x 240 pixels but this certainly isn?t a deal breaker. Sony Ericsson have done a good job of customizing the interface and making the icons large enough, given the limited screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They have opted for more screens rather than downsizing the tiles, which, even if a bit slower, is the more comfortable option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini packs the Timescape UI plug-in but lacks the Mediascape that is only reserved for its full-grown X10 for now. Timescape is an application that brings all your communications together. It always displays an aggregated view of your SMS, MMS, email, missed calls, Facebook and Twitter updates all on one screen. It also has a large number of tabs that can filter the content by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, Sony Ericsson have managed to make best use of the limited screen estate by adding large thumbable shortcuts at the four corners of the homescreen. Those lead to the message composer, music player, phonebook and dial pad/call log by default but you can easily replace them if you see fit. The tiny Android is obviously short of hardware keys but they?re not badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has also been affected by the resize. You are limited to widgets only ? no shortcuts or folders are allowed and you can only add one widget per screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the number of available homescreen panes isn?t limited so each time you add a widget a new screen appears. You can then rearrange the screens as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the Sony Ericsson R&amp;D have found enough space for the notification area, which we consider to be one of the best Android features. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. Sliding it down however reveals the whole story - you get a list of all recent notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the X10 mini you press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It gives you access to the six most recently used apps although, due to the specific operation of the operating system, some of them might be hibernating rather than actually running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the actual performance is surely where the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is nothing short of impressive. Regular HVGA resolution and a 528 MHz CPU that most other droids use surely ensures a decently smooth Android run. But when you cut the number of pixels in half and crank up the clock speed a bit, the thing starts flying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, but this time there are no custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add an IM nickname to the contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details are displayed in sections. Clicking a given number dials the contact while opting for the envelope icon next to it launches the message editor. Those two buttons fill an entire horizontal row so that they are more thumbable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The sound is loud and clear if you manage to hold the phone right. That?s a bit easier said than done as the phone is quite small and we had a finger on the mouthpiece on several occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the XPERIA X10 mini, just like the rest of the Android crew (except for the HTC Hero and Samsung Galaxy S) doesn?t feature smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the X10 mini the call log is a part of the dialer application. You can easily search the entries in it by flick scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold in next to your ear for a call. There is no chance of ever hitting an on-screen button with your cheek on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. We were rather disappointed with its Below Average score. You might want to keep an eye on the little fella when it?s noisy around you if you don?t want to miss calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited text input puts the brake on messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini isn?t the heavy texters? choice. The software is just fine, but with the limited text input options long messaging sessions are out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini you are limited to a standard multitap keypad (T9 is supported though) and given the available screen estate we don?t think a virtual QWERTY would have made any sense. Not on a capacitive screen anyway, where stylus is a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you are really into typing on tiny virtual buttons you can find apps in the Android market, which enable QWERTY keyboard for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, the X10 mini pro should be the choice for those that actually do more than an occasional SMS on their phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery?s nothing to get excited about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini gallery automatically locates the images, no matter where they are stored. There is none of the cool new look of Android 2.0 and later devices ? you just get a plain grid with your images sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just sweep to the left or right when looking at a photo fullscreen, and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch-zooming isn?t available but Sony Ericsson have come up with their own version of one-finger zoom that actually works great. You just hold your finger down and than sweep upwards for zooming in or downwards for zooming out. There?s also the double-tap zoom if that?s how you roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there are no Bluetooth file transfers in the gallery or any other fancy functionality that more demanding users might expect. The X10 mini is a simple tool for previewing your images and it won?t do more than that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player needs more work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For some unknown reason, video playback has been one of the hardest things for Android to pull off. First, there was no video player at all and we have seen very little progress so far if you don?t count some custom-made improvements by select makers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, there is a player now but looks and functionality are nothing special by today?s standards. You get a list of all videos available on the phone and play/pause, skip controls, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is also pretty limited with DivX and XviD nowhere to be seen. H.264 MP4 files is as good as you are gonna get, but at least those seemed to run okay with little to no hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market already offers a player that supports DivX and XviD videos. The yxflash player handles well the files we threw at it but you need to keep your videos below VGA resolution or it becomes too much for the hardware to handle. The bad is that you only get the trial version for free and after it expires you need to pay 9.9 US dollars for the full license.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is pretty basic too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite a fresh redesign, the music player on the XPERIA X10 mini didn?t get much in terms of new features. It manages your audio files decently but there is very little extra functionality beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best bit is the shortcut key that allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube or Sony Ericsson?s own Play Now arena by pressing the Infinite button .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t even gradual typing for searching a specific song this time so you will have to use the kinetic scrolling or opt for artist sorting. At least there are three smart playlists that automatically gather your newly added, most played and never played tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still a lot of shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. For example there are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling between them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini performed more than decently in our traditional audio quality test. The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk are the strongest points of its performance but the rest of the readings aren't bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The total harmonic distortion levels are pretty good and even if the intermodulation distortion is slightly above average, it's nothing to worry about. Oh and the frequency response is pretty good too, but for the cut-off extreme bass frequencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini vs Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 frequency response graphs</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plain 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini has a 5 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels and a LED flash. It doesn?t sound like much but the size of the package says it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is as simple as it gets with four buttons in total. There is a camera/camcorder switch, a gallery button, scene mode and flash settings. The four available scene presets include twilight, sports, landscape and, of course auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is certainly one of the most basic camera interfaces on the market but we guess Sony Ericsson thought users wouldn?t need much more and will prefer simplicity to functionality. In the end, it all comes down to the image quality, so let?s see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is pretty pleasing with a good amount of resolved detail and the noise levels kept well under control, even in not so favorable lighting. Contrast on the other hand is somewhat low at times and the colors are a usually bit off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the X10 mini goes as high as VGA resolution which, needless to say, is far from impressive. At least the framerate is a good 30 fps to make sure motion looks smooth enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the video quality, turn the video light on and off and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in 3gp format suggesting lower bitrate, which in turn leads to some compression artifacts. Video also suffers from the lack of contrast, much like the still camera so videos aren't too nice to watch on a computer screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is X10 mini sample video shot at VGA@30fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: all on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is full suite on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. For starters, you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for worldwide roaming and two versions with either dual-band (900/2100 MHz) or tri-band (850/1900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to local connectivity, the X10 mini offers USB v2.0, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support (no file transfer though) and Wi-Fi. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a compatible cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so you probably already have one lying around and they give some impressive speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is in a dire need of a higher-res screen and Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini is an Android phone and an excellent web browser is an important part of that description. With the exception of Flash, the browser performs pretty decently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is rather minimalist ? all you get on the screen are the zoom controls. The address bar is hidden by default to save some space as the low resolution doesn?t allow too much content to fit on the screen anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Android browser on the X10 mini supports only a single zoom method ? the dedicated onscreen buttons. There is no double tap or one-finger zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the browser supports text reflow ? as soon as you zoom, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. And there?s also the nice magnifying glass browsing mode, which let?s you browse the page quickly until you reach the part that you want to focus and then zoom in on to read it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and four keys pop up. You can open/switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash support is the other letdown of the X10 mini browser. There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer does the job, with some help from the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini came with no preinstalled document viewer so we had to snatch one off the Android Market. There is plenty of choice there so we don?t consider it too much of a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you download an app it automatically integrates with the Gmail app as well, so you can view attachments. Unfortunately, you can?t save them in the phone memory (that only works for images). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other disadvantage is we didn?t find a free app that also supports editing so if you decide to edit documents on the X10 mini (highly unlikely anyway) you will have to spend some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has only two view modes - daily and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator, a timer and a stopwatch aboard. Those are all nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini features a decent alarm clock application, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RoadSync applications, which also come preinstalled use the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync protocol to provide push synchronization of your corporate email, contacts and calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally comes the YouTube app which, as we said, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that with the X10 mini you have Google Maps out of the box. Multi-touch doesn't work and double tapping won't do either. To zoom in and out you use the two virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen. These are hidden when not in use and only appear when you touch the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the screen activates Street view. As usual, you can enjoy the 3D view of the area, which is controlled by sweep gestures with impressive fluidity. They can also make use of the built-in compass for an even better experience ? just hold the phone in your hand and turn around and Street view will follow you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation isn't available on the X10 mini?s Google Maps. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll be able to reach your goal, assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the other preinstalled map application is Wisepilot to pick up where Google Maps left. The thing about Wisepilot is that it requires a license for voice guided navigation and it downloads data over the Internet. That makes it unsuitable (or at least really expensive) for using abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already several ways around that of course. The Android Market offers a dozen of applications so it?s up to you to pick one that best suits you. The problem is that the screen and the phone itself seem too small to use for navigation but we guess everyone should judge that for themselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the Android Market in the previous section and we found SatNav software, both free and paid, with very little effort. Since we haven?t heard of some of the apps, user ratings were a good clue of what?s worth checking out and user reviews helped us decide which ones to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market made a very positive impression ? the number of available apps is growing by the day and a good deal of them is free. In fact as it turns out, if you?re after free apps, Android Market has a larger percentage of those than any of the application stores of the competition. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs, and each tab shows the best in the relevant category. The third tab keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty basic tools (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Small phones are special, no doubt about that. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 might just be too special to have mass appeal but we don?t think it?s what this phone is trying to do. The X10 mini is an experiment, which works out well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s hard not to like the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. It?s equally hard we think to not notice its limitations. But we should make it clear: it delivers on the main promise it made when it first appeared in public ? it?s a capable smartphone that every pocket can take. Better yet, it isn?t outrageously expensive either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user-interface has been well optimized for the little (in touchscreen terms that is) display and while this has involved some functionality sacrifices, they aren?t too bad. Granted, you won?t be able to edit documents or read maps as comfortably as on the full-size XPERIA X10 but the mini is by no means a poor relation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No review can help you make up your mind about a phone like this one ? if you haven?t already. You might think it?s a cool and cute li?l droid ? or see no point in it whatsoever. After all, there?s plenty of smartphones out there that will do the same things (and better) within the same budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to put things into perspective, let?s check some of the potential challengers in the lightweight division.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you can do without smartphone capabilities you might want to check out the Samsung M5650 Lindy and the LG GD880 Mini. Both are lookers (we do admit though to a particularly soft spot for the LG mini) and offer plenty of connectivity in compact form factor. They certainly aren?t as small as the XPERIA X10 mini but will perhaps cost substantially less.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If smartphone is a must, but it doesn?t have to be Android, Nokia 5530 XpressMusic is another affordable handset that will easily slip in any pocket. Again, the size comparison is undoubtedly in the X10 mini?s favor and the Nokia 5530 skimps on 3G but essentially it?s a compact smartphone that will save you a good deal of cash.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you would like to stick around in droid land, you have the HTC Tattoo to check out. It gives similar performance but comes in a larger body and trades the Timescape UI for Sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always go for some QWERTY-ness with the XPERIA X10 Mini Pro or the Nokia N97 Mini. Because, let?s face it ? text input is not among the X10 Mini?s strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro ? Nokia N97 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well it does look like there is plenty of choice in the compact class, but not a single one goes quite as far as the XPERIA X10 mini. If size really matters this is the ONE real mini, and basically your best option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading your mail, browsing the web or watching video will be better on almost any other touch phone out there. But the X10 mini doesn?t want you to be sensible and practical. It hopes you?ll appreciate the idea behind it. Getting smaller and better ? isn?t this the life story of mobile phones.</paragraph>
