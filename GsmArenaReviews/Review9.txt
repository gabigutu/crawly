			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sometimes it?s the most unassuming of handsets that can start a revolution. The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition doesn?t top any geeks? wishlist, nor does it make for the perfect business device. But what it does have is a DVB-H TV receiver and it brings this extremely rare feature in an affordable package so a wider audience can get a taste of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And once you get a chance to try it, you might decide that it?s exactly what you want in your next high-end phone. There is more than one way of becoming a market success and the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition certainly takes a risky path. But it?s a path that might just pay off for Nokia in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of disadvantages of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition isn?t the shortest we have seen but it?s not much longer than you would expect from a feature phone with this kind of price tag. After all you get what you pay for and for its price the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV isn?t that bad as a package at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen madness is rapidly taking over the mobile world but Nokia chose a non-touch device to try and achieve better penetration of the DVB-H feature. And while this somewhat limits the number of potential customers it will arguably also help bring the price down so the ones that prefer good old tactile feedback keys get a better deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let?s see about that by examining the handset performance. The hardware side of things is just around the corner. Follow us to page two of our Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition retail package is downright low-end. A 1GB microSD card, a charger and a one-piece handsfree is all you get inside the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the meager storage, Nokia has skimped on the USB cable as well. There isn?t one in the retail box, presumably in an attempt to bring the price down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition stands at 101 x 48 x 14 mm, which is reasonably compact for a slider with a 2.4? screen. It will easily fit into most pockets so there?s very little to worry about there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs 113 grams, which is probably a bit more than you would expect given the dimensions and the all plastic case. Still, it gives the 5330 Mobile TV edition a good solid feel that we really appreciated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition looks pretty nice at first glance with is sleek piano black finish. The problem is that it easily turns into a smudgy mess, so those positive impressions don?t last for long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also the quality of the plastic used for the body seems to be shockingly poor, scratching far too easy for the handset to maintain any visual attraction in the long run.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition comes complete with a 2.4? display of QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While its contrast levels are nowhere near the best examples on the market today, the viewing angles of the Nokia 5330 display are quite good. Brightness levels are acceptable given the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case non-touch feature phones don?t come with much better displays so the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition deserves a decent mark. However this is one of the reasons why those handsets aren?t the best ones to watch TV on, yet the 5330 is designed to do just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample D-pad is dead center on the navigational pad below the screen sided by four other keys (two soft buttons and two call management keys). All keys are decently sized and create no usability issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is above the the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition display, while on the left of it are the three touch-sensitive music keys. Those feel somewhat unnatural to use at first given the non-touch nature of the handset but once you get used to them, they become a comfortable way of controlling the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the volume rocker and the screen lock/unlock slider. There is no dedicated camera key here but it?s not badly missed when the camera is only fixed focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because the microphone pinhole is located at the lower half of the slider, the bottom of the phone is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition features the loudspeaker grill, the lanyard eyelet and the microSD card slot. There is a protective cover over the card slot to keep away dirt and grime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three openings at the top of the phone. The 2mm charger plug is located on the left, followed by the microUSB port and the 3.5mm audio jack. There is another cap over the USB port but the audio jack is left exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals the 12-key alphanumeric keypad, surrounded by a glowing bluish line which we believe youngsters will appreciate. It?s the flatbed type but does have some bordering between keys on different rows and columns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are decently sized and with good press feedback, making a positive overall impression and allowing decent typing speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our trip of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition hardware with the rear panel. This is where the 3 megapixel camera lens is located, along with its LED flash companion. Neither the fixed-focus camera nor the short-range flash are anything to brag about but we will come back to them later in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back panel you can find the 1000 mAh Li-Ion BL-4U battery, which powers the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition. The battery is quoted at up to 350 hours of stand-by or up to 7 hours and 42 minutes of talk-time. Those are pretty good numbers and real life performance backs them up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a few minutes of telephony and about an hour of fiddling with the other features of the phone each day, the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition lived through four full days, and that is a pretty decent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However despite the nice ergonomics, our general opinion about the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition build quality is pretty poor. The handset never left the office nor was it subjected to any abuse, and yet its back was scratched all over. If laying it on its back on a desk is too much for this handset to handle, we don?t know what Nokia were thinking during the design process.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition employs the Series 40 6th edition user interface so the environment is very familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lack of a document reader is where the S40 still loses out to its Samsung competitors, while the multi-tasking and vastly better multimedia tip the nod in favor of the Sony Ericsson feature phone platform. Nokia on the other hand are still relying on their vast market share with its feature phone user interface and prefer to deliver a familiar user experience rather than try and create a revolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two points of view to this approach for the two large groups that buy these low-end and lower-mid-range feature phones. The first is that if you want a simple call and text device a familiar interface will be better than a higher spec?d handset with a more confusing UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second large group of customers that buy similar phones are the ones looking for better bang-for-buck deals, the bargain hunters. Those will probably be better off with some of the competition?s offerings as they have a richer list of features. But anyway, let?s skip to the actual interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly redesigned standby screen of the 5330 Mobile TV Edition features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time occupying the top part of the screen. The fonts have been noticeably enlarged on all recent S40 handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is also available. It consists of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. Normally, one of the areas is reserved for the Shortcut bar, which grants instant access to favorite functions and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is that pressing the end key while the keypad is locked brings up a clock that shows the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a new view mode for the main menu, displaying a single icon at a time, much like in their S30 ultra-low end handsets and first generations of the S40 UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the lack of multi-tasking support, you can't just minimize a Java application (such as the Opera browser) and go read a new message, for instance. That?s one department S40 is still behind most of the major competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition stores up to 2000 contacts, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for 99% of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound cause no concerns with the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition. Like almost all current S40 midrange phones this one also features Voice Clarity which is another way of saying that it applies some sort of background noise suppression during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration strength on the 5330 Mobile TV Edition is pretty decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary as it is fully speaker independent. The Nokia 5330 managed to recognize a large number of the commands we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has not included any Smart dialing features, so all typing a number would give you is the "helpful" option to start a countdown timer (interpreting the numbers as hours, minutes and seconds) but won't search through your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition is a Very Good performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is certainly up to the task. The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing a SMS/MMS message is a nice experience with the comfy 5330 keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around it. You enter a few letters of a contact's name and then click match. This brings up a list of matching contacts and selecting one prompts you to choose either a mobile number or an email address, then it will shift automatically to the message body where you can start typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password, the 5330 took care of the rest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A boring gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 gallery is way behind what virtually all other platforms have to offer. The Nokia 5330 freshens it up a bit, but a new look and improved functionality are due if it is compete with rival platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition offers only a single view mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. At least zooming in on a single picture is pretty comfortable now with the zoom in and out shortcuts placed on the middle and right soft keys. It?s also faster and smoother than we are used to seeing from most of its predecessors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile TV is not for all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What gave the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition its name was the DVB-H support the phone comes with. However, before you even start thinking of getting yourself one of these, you?d better check if DVB-H standard (H stands for Handheld) has already landed in your country (or town).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Nokia seems to have got the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV specs wrong on some of its websites, which list the phone as compatible with the DVB-T standard (T stands for Terrestrial).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mobile TV app interface is pretty simple. Once opened, it starts searching for channels. Keep in mind that you can watch Mobile TV only if the enclosed headset is connected to the phone since it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the 5330 looks decently and has a good set of features. It has great all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled either with the dedicated touch music keys on the screen?s left or with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be active for the info to be displayed. You can play/pause or change the current track using the dedicated touch sensitive music keys.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on 5330 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition comes with a decently sized screen (for the phone?s class) what hinders it from becoming a real PMP is the limited functionality of its video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While many of the 5330 competitors feature support for DivX/XviD video files out of the box, the 5330 will only be able to play 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, fast-forwarded or rewound and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Remarkable audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To say that the audio quality of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition is similar to the on of Nokia 6700 slide would be the understatement of the year. The audio output of the two matches so well that we are absolutely convinced that there's identical audio hardware inside both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That means that while only average in terms of loudness, the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition audio quality is as clear as we have seen mobile phones get. Not that this comes as a great surprise as all Nokia handsets that we have tested recently were pretty impressive. Even the low-key 2710 did an excellent job with our test sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And given the presence of a 3.5mm audio jack, we can safely say that it's about time that you retire your dedicated music player. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No autofocus for the 3.2 MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition is armed with a 3.2 megapixel camera for image resolution of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. While it lacks autofocus it at least packs a LED flash. The LED flash is also rather inadequate, only really usable in rather close ranges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the mid-range targeting. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5330 doesn't rank among the top 3.2 megapixel shooters in terms of image quality. Images are a bit oversharpened, but with good contrast and acceptable color rendering (save for the occasional bluish/greenish tint).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise levels are normally quite high and the aggressive noise reduction that kicks in takes its toll on resolved fine detail. At 100% magnification there's easily visible watercolor effect on most surface textures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally the lack of detail in images is a major weakness along with the limited dynamic range, which easily leads to underdeveloped shadows or blown highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed is reasonable enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get even worse when we talk about video recording. The 5330 manages QVGA resolution at 15 fps that only seem good enough for MMS purposes. Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>So-so connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition connectivity options are somewhat limited by the lack of 3G support. And while you miss the joy of browsing over 3G you at least get EDGE and quad-band GSM support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is neither Wi-Fi nor GPS. Bluetooth version 2.0 is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also present and as you already know it?s hot swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port on the Nokia 5330 is good for transferring files as well, plus you can charge your phone over the USB cable. You?d have to buy one yourselves though as Nokia hasn?t bundled one with the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition has an integrated WebKit-based HTML web browser. We guess that rings a bell. Apple's Safari and Mobile Safari are based on WebKit, as well as the browser for the Android platform and the Palm Pre. It's safe to say that 5330 is in good company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not to say however that you will get a similarly good user experience as those are very different devices we are talking about here. However the WebKit background helps the browser render pages accurately and that is a vital improvement over the previously used web browsers in S40 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 native browser still has its shortcomings though. There are obvious indications that the hardware is not quite up to the job ? for one, scrolling is quite slow. Flash is also not supported - there's some rudimentary support but it's just enough to display certain banners, nothing more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most other S40 phones recently, the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition also comes with the Opera Mini browser preinstalled. It speed up that browsing with its ?Up to 90% compression?, which is vital when relying on a slow non-3G connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV Edition is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into sharing images, video and audio files with your buddies straight from your handset have a look at Ovi Share. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is limited, you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the built-in one works quite well). Bear in mind that even 3 megapixel photos can cost you quite a bit at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search initially, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Searching launches the web browser, which makes this app somewhat useless. Or rather, it would have been if the browser had this functionality built-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By now you're aware that the 5330 doesn't have built-in GPS, but the Maps app can work without one - you can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, but you'll have to do without voice guided navigation. Furthermore it won't give you your general location based on Cell-ID like Google Maps does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Many games on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several games preinstalled and they are diverse enough to help most people kill a bit of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Block?d, a version of the popular Bejeweled game where you have to bring blocks with matching colors together in order to discard them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Diamond rush it?s Sokoban meets Indiana Jones. Find the hidden treasure and push boulders out of the way, but be careful not to block your route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rally stars will appeal to racing fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real Football 2010 is yet another football game. Keep ?em coming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition is a device that?s hard to recommend. Sure it looks pretty sleek at first but turns into a greasy scratched mess so quickly that you won?t have enough time to enjoy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does bring a feature to the mid-range that we have only met once before but the problem is that DVB-H streaming TV is still only available to a very small audience. Even if you?re among the lucky ones, we aren?t particularly sure if watching a limited number of TV channels on such a small screen is enough to warrant spending the extra money on this device, especially given its limited feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you aren?t into touch-driven phones (where Nokia offers some great bang for your buck), there are still plenty of better alternatives than the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV edition. Let?s list a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C903 might be a bit dated but it comes with a Cyber-shot camera, packs a more advanced user interface and costs less than the Nokia 5330 Mobile TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your budget is fixed anyway the Sony Ericsson Hazel will even throw in GPS, Wi-Fi, splash-resistance and a bigger screen on top of that for the same kind of cash as the Nokia 5330. It?s hard to beat that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson C903 ? Sony Ericsson Hazel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't help but notice that in-house competition looks even more threatening. The Nokia 6700 classic is a definite contender despite its age. We actually feel it has the upper hand and if having a smartphone isn't a necessity, it represents great value for money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elsewhere from within Nokia?s own stables, the 6700 slider and the bar-shaped Nokia C5 will give you smartphone capabilities, a better build and the choice between GPS and Wi-Fi. And with Nokia smartphones a built-in GPS equals free lifetime voice-guided navigation with Ovi Maps so the offer is definitely worth a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C5 ? Nokia 6700 slide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To finish up, we would say that if you happen to be among the lucky ones with DVB-H broadcasting in your area and you are a real TV addict you might consider the Nokia 5330 TV edition. After all it?s not that expensive and if it allows you to enjoy one of your favorite pastimes on the go it definitely sounds like a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However if you don?t have DVB-H where you live, or you do not plan to use it, then avoid this handset. It?s overpriced, badly built and packs a user interface that no longer cuts it against the competition. Sure the battery life and the decent screen might have some value but it?s peanuts compared to what similar-priced non-TV devices can offer.</paragraph>
