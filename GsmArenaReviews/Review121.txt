			<paragraph>You may've thought Nokia lost their touch, you may be out of love with the Nseries but the Nseries are always keeping an eye on you. Their wide-angle, variable aperture eye. On you. Whether the Nokia Nseries are making up the ground lost in the megapixel race or claiming back what they believe is rightfully theirs, they seem to have the right leadership to put them back on the megapixel map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Armed with one of the most advanced cameras in terms of hardware and features you don't just find on every other handset out there, the N86 8MP is keen to take cue from the N85 and shake the Nseries out of their slumber. Now, in case you forgot, it's still the market leader we're talking about here, and that should probably tell why everybody is so worked up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the question as always is whether strong performance will deliver on that awesome promise. And you've got us to help you make a more informed decision about buying Nokia N86 8MP. Given all the comments above, the N86 8MP is more the kind to encourage impulsive spending but you'll choose wisely not to miss our write-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP offers advanced camera technologies, combined with the power and maturity of the Symbian OS and the intuitive S60 3rd edition interface. It doesn't get any better than that on paper, and if you aren't all caught up in touchscreen, you're most likely about to check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But no matter if the glass is half full or half empty to you, we guess you wouldn't want to miss Nokia's first move in the 8 megapixel game. The Nseries proven all-round skill and the innovative camera features have us eager to explore this promising cameraphone. We're most curious of course to find out if they got the image quality right. But first things first - the handset gets unboxed and ready to roll on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package - bare minimum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having just forked out on a high-end handset you kind of feel entitled to a couple of treats in the retail package. The Nokia N86 8MP however fails to deliver, bringing only the most essential stuff along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the mid-sized container you will find a regular charger, a USB data cable and a two-piece headset that lets you swap the headphones and keep the remote. Nokia OVI suite (as it is now known) is also included on a disk, as well as a hard copy of a user guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no memory card supplied as Nokia probably thought 8GB of internal storage would do for a start. The thing is it does, really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N86 8MP 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 103.4 x 51.4 x 16.5 mm, totaling a volume of 69 cc the Nokia N86 8MP is a reasonably sized handset considering the feature load. If it wasn't for the dual-slide design, we bet a few more millimeters could've been trimmed here and there. As things stand now - you can easily find a more compact 8MP cameraphone or a more compact smartphone, but not both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 149 grams though is an entirely different story, making the Nokia N86 8MP the heaviest 8MP handset to date. While there is no question about it being heavy, we did enjoy the solid and secure feel of the phone. We still suggest you check how that works for you before taking out the cash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Placing the Nokia N86 8MP and the N81 side-by-side reveals striking resemblance. Although our distaste for its design is well documented, we have to admit the materials used on the casing make all the difference this time. While we are still not particularly happy with the shiny fingerprint-gathering front, the plastic on the rear feels really nice and looks just the same as Nokia N97.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have to admit that the fingerprints on the front panel aren't as easily visible as on some other phones. Except fort the metallic frame that is, which turns into a smudgy mess when the handset is used extensively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP front panel is mostly taken by the 2.6" 16M-color AMOLED display of QVGA resolution. It looks identical to the one found on the Nokia N85 suggesting that the N86 8MP was meant as more of an update of N85 than a totally new phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED technology is exciting enough with all its benefits, but the QVGA resolution is starting to seem outdated. In times where LG and Samsung are introducing feature phones with WVGA screens, a high-end device with less than a quarter of their pixel count is hardly a commendable achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottom line is, the display still offers great contrast and decent brightness but it isn't comparable to, say, the Samsung S8000 Jet, which uses the same technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another issue of the Nokia N86 8MP display is its poor sunlight legibility. The screen is hardly readable on a bright sunny day and this is a major problem for a cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are 6 keys, three on either side of the D-pad. Those include the two soft keys, the Call and End buttons, the Menu key and the clear knob, arranged in a layout so typical of Nseries lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is a bit smaller than average - we guess it all started with the N85. The obvious gain is that the N85 and the N86 8MP don't have their Call and End keys so uncomfortably crammed to the sides like the N78 and the N81. At the same time, the D-pad is still quite user-friendly, with nice and solid press in both confirm and scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top end of the front panel is the earpiece, surrounded by the ambient light sensor and the video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad uses a standard 4-row 12-key layout. There is quite enough space between the different rows and columns. The keys could've been bigger though and press feedback is slightly on the squishy side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the Nokia N86 8MP down reveals the four multimedia keys. You use them to control the music player or the gallery. The middle pair can also be used for gaming and is quite handy with some of the N-gage titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Nokia N86 8MP hosts a tiny keylock switch. It's not essential on a slider, to say the least: sliding up and down does the locking job. Releasing the lens cover automatically unlocks the phone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key on the right side is comfortable enough, with distinct half and full press. The volume rocker above is equally pleasant to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key is on top, along with the microUSB slot and the 3.5mm jack. None of the two connection ports is covered, probably due to the limited space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP back side owes its sleek looks and comfy grip to the plastic used - think N97. It hosts the 8MP wide-angle camera lens and the dual-LED flash, hidden under an active cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the lens cover is active and will automatically start the camera or unlock the handset. When you are done with it you can close it and the handset will return to the exact same state it was before you began shooting.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The active kickstand folds around the camera deck and by default it starts the image gallery when you flip it open. Nokia have also added an option to customize its behavior to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery under the rear cover sounds quite decent on paper. It's quoted at up to 312 hours of stand-by and 6 hours and 18 minutes of talk time in 2G networks, while with 3G you can count on 264 hours of stand-by and 3 hours and 54 minutes of talk time. That's about what it manages to deliver in reality too: we had to charge our handset three times over a week of quite heavy use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider action is spot on, the effort required to put it in motion just about perfect. It gives away a nice click every time it locks in one of the three positions. The build quality raised no concerns and the phone was commendably comfortable to navigate and handle, even at such a considerable weight. The materials used on the casing are the same as the superior Nokia N97 so you can rest assured you get the Nseries - if not Nokia's - best.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>This is Symbian S60<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd Edition user interface and Feature Pack 2 preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since we last welcomed a classic Nseries device at our office. Nokia N85 was the last one to call by, and now we meet its successor - the Nokia N86 8MP. The seven-month long gap naturally brings some new UI graphics and some changes under the hood and there they are implemented on the Nokia N86 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout is quite familiar with status icons displayed at the top of the screen and the soft key labels taking the bottom. Quite naturally, Nokia N86 8MP also supports Active standby with two optional layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have experience with Nokia S60 smartphones, the first difference you will notice is the new look that the menu icons have. We already met that styling in the touch controlled 5800 and N97 and now they have been transferred to the S60 3rd edition as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby theme and main menu have no changes in terms of functionality. All the usual suspects are here and remain the same - Maps, Tools, Settings, Messages, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen has the three familiar layouts to choose from - a vertical bar, a horizontal bar and a basic view. They are also updated with the Symbian touch edition icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby screen is a typical Symbian option and is a nice and convenient way of bringing the shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen can either be organized in vertical or horizontal tabs which can then be scrolled with the D-pad. If active standby is disabled the direction keys of the D-pad can also be assigned four shortcuts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby or not, you can always change the shortcuts assigned to the two soft keys to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Enough about graphics, the UI is alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP can automatically rotate the user interface thanks to the built-in accelerometer. Quite not typical of dual-slide Nokia the UI does not automatically go landscape if you slide to reveal the music player/gallery keys. Even more interesting, there's no app launching when you slide the phone that way and there is no option to configure that behavior. That is definitely strange, as Nokia promised that the short side of the slider will be active (launching a certain application) and most of all customizable (you can actually pick the application).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a new Flash-based screen saver which is very fancy and quite eye-catchy. It is a digital clock build by small squares and is always landscape oriented. We first saw that on Nokia N97 and it suited its slide-and-tilt desktop position quite well. With the Nokia N86 8MP, you can get the phone to the same position by placing it on its back kickstand. Still, you won't be able to enjoy the clock for much long with the default power-saving options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP also features the new and improved task manager that comes with Feature Pack 2. It is also now somewhat better looking and is appearing on top of every pop-up menu. The shortcut used in previous versions of the OS by pressing and holding the menu key still works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP uses a single ARM 11 434 MHz CPU with no dedicated graphic accelerator. This still fares quite well in Symbian terms, as far as UI responsiveness is concerned. The phone reacts quickly, if not instantly, to most commands across menus. Lately, Nokia are using processors with 1.5x the clock speed, so the N86 8MP is definitely not their top performer, but is still nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP user-available memory extends to a little less than 50MB topped with the 8GB that are already on board. While the 8GB on board are pretty all you'll ever need, there are cases when the limited system storage of 50MB will get in your way. For example, when downloading files from the internet, the web browser always saves them to the system partition, meaning you will bump into the 50MB limit sooner than you've thought.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Customize your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The choice of menu view modes with Nokia N86 8MP is quite extensive. You get to pick between four different options, which should have a little something for everybody. The first two are the well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe layouts. They do look a lot better but working with them does take time getting used to. The font sizes throughout the menus are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your final option for customizing the UI is changing the currently active theme. There are three preinstalled themes on Nokia N86 8MP, but you are by no means limited to them only. Downloading additional ones from the internet and installing them on your N86 8MP is quick and easy and the choices offered are endless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Nokia N86 8MP. Reception levels are good and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there is no Smart dialing feature on the Nokia N86 8MP (but that can be fixed with a third-party application). At least the built-in voice recognition system is doing quite a good job recognizing most of the commands. It is also fully speaker independent and doesn't require prerecording of the commands. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a name, voice dialing only dials the default one with no option to change that as you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results from our loudspeaker test. Nokia N86 8MP didn't quite manage to impress us here, producing only an average score. So don't put the phone too far away in a noisy environment or you might end up missing quite a lot of calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the table comparing the N86 8MP to some of the its Nseries siblings we've put to the same test. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit this link.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Symbian phonebook is still perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian devices (Nokia N86 8MP included) have phonebooks that can basically do anything you can think of with your contacts. Storage space can potentially extend to the whole phone memory, which is impossible to deplete even if you tried intentionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A messenger within<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The first two share the all too familiar intuitive editor. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. An indicator in brackets is showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching from SMS to MMS is as simple as inserting some multimedia content. The phone prompts scaling down photos that are too large for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP also features the dedicated audio message editor for instant recording of audio. You can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports pop up on the standby screen and are then saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. The best part is that Nokia N86 8MP is yet another handset that sports the ultra easy email setup we came to know in recent Nokia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service (be it POP or IMAP) is set to run on the N86 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and generally, you can hardly think of something important that the Nokia N86 8MP is missing (except perhaps Blackberry Connect support, but if you are into that, obviously Nokia prefers that you go get yourself a Blackberry instead).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File manager browse them all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management options (which even includes sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that Nokia N86 8MP can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard Nokia N86 8MP. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery - n-series of extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia N86 8MP uses the good-looking and well-known 3D rotating view that has been reserved for Nseries turf only. However we saw the same gallery on the Nokia 5630 XpressMusic, so we guess even old traditions break under the pressure of modern competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of cleaning up your file system every now and then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Nseries gallery brings no changes in terms of features - pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and zoomed in up to 400%. Zooming speed has received a small boost and while it's not a record breaker by any means, it's noticeably faster than say, a certain Samsung INNOV8, which runs the same OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a nice slide show with customizable effects and delay between slides. You can also choose the direction of the slideshow - forward or backward from the currently selected photo and the track to go with it. Music can also be switched off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a very good picture tagging system. In addition to geotagging, which is automatically handled by the camera, you can add as many tags as you like to each photo and then use them as filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've already seen the nice little kickstand that Nokia N86 8MP comes with. It's probably good to know that it's active meaning that when you flip it open, the image gallery automatically kick in on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image gallery may be the default application to launch, but in fact that behavior is customizable and you can set some other feature or even an application or a game to launch when you hit the kickstand open. Unfortunately, as we already said, the same doesn't hold true for the shorter, reversed direction of the slider, although Nokia stated othwerwise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The old music player still does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Barely surprising for a multimedia device, the music player of Nokia N86 8MP is quite capable. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't handle. Album art is also supported but unluckily there are no alternative skins for the music player UI itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface, except the new icons, hasn't changed at all. There is no eye-candy, no transition effects or nice buttons. Same old skin, same old player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available. You can also create your own playlists in no time. The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You can avoid that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and if they seem insufficient, you can create new ones in a matter of seconds. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally having dedicated music keys certainly makes managing the music player easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N86 8MP has pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Nokia N86 8MP is pretty much identical to that of the Nokia N97 which equals success. Save for the disturbingly high intermodulation distortion levels, the handset excelled in all other parts of our test achieving some pretty impressive scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response has been greatly improved over what the previous generation of Nokia phone could deliver. It now closes on perfection, deviating by no more than 0.32dB throughout the audible range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are also very good, comparable to the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP video player can work in both portrait and landscape mode and can be switched to fullscreen. When in full screen, the soft key labels are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching video on the N86 8MP might not be the best experience around due to the smallish screen, but, hey, there's the kickstand to make up for that to an extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player has no DivX/XviD support so you need to use a third-party video player, such as the popular Core Player. Or you can of course leave it to Nokia PC Suite/Ovi Suite to transcode your videos to the MP4 format, the handset supports out-of-the-box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N86 8MP has the familiar neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and Visual radio. The latter requires internet connection and WLAN won't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With RDS and automatic scanning however you're less likely to resort to network data transfers with Visual Radio. In addition Nokia N86 8MP offers a direct shortcut to the online radio directory where hundreds of stations are available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM transmitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature of the Nokia N86 8MP is the built-in FM transmitter. It allows you to broadcast your favorite tracks over a predefined radio frequency. Those can then be picked up by any device with an FM radio receiver in the vicinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transmitting signal strength of the N86 8MP is decent, making it quite usable in a car for example. The FM transmitter application itself has a really nice and simple user interface so the handset has every chance of replacing a CD changer in your car for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP wide-angle camera sounds exciting but needs tuning up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP, as the name suggests, sports an 8 megapixel camera, which is probably its key selling point. It sports a maximum image resolution of 3264x2448 pixels and boasts Carl Zeiss lens as usual for the Nokia cameraphone flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 28mm (in 35mm terms) wide-angle lens, autofocus and dual-LED flash it is some pretty pretty impressive equipment as far as hardware is concerned. A xenon flash would have left very little more to be demanded but we guess Nokia doesn't favor those anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However being the first handset to feature 28mm lens, the Nokia N86 8MP is still guaranteed to excite every proper geek out there. For those of you unfamiliar with the material we will explain that the 28mm lens gives you roughly 20 percent larger angle of view when looking through the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make this advantage even more obvious, here's a collage illustrating the framing difference between a regular cameraphone and the wide-angle Nokia N86 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wide-angle lens is especially useful when taking landscape and architecture photos as you don't need to go as far back to fit the whole subject in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side wide-angle lens aren't as suitable for photographing portraits from close range as people's faces turn out unnaturally distorted. It's not that 35mm is that great for making portraits either but 28mm is even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disadvantage of the 28mm lens is that fitting more stuff in the same frame means that the things in it are actually smaller (described by fewer pixels, if you wish) and if you don't need the extra angle of view you are loosing some scene detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, all other things equal, we would take a 28mm wide angle cameraphone any day - it's just seems more suited for all-purpose walk-around uses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cameraphone innovation found on the Nokia N86 8MP is its variable aperture. It's not technically a first since the Motorola Motozine ZN5 was the pioneer here but it's still rare enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In layman's terms, theory says the variable aperture allows the camera to choose either the benefit of better-than-standard light sensitivity or better-than-standard sharpness throughout the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to use the proper terminology, Nokia N86 8MP shoots at F/2.4 to let more light in low-light conditions and stops down to F/3.2 or F/4.8 when light conditions allow it. Technically the photos at smaller apertures (indicated by a larger F-stop value) should be sharper and with larger depth of field than photos shot by any other 8 megapixel cameraphone on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Nokia didn't give the users any kind of manual control over the aperture value and it is all automatic. We are not saying that such an option will be used too much but why not give the occasional enthusiastic user the choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the N86 8MP camera also has a mechanical shutter (much like Samsung i8510 INNOV8, Nokia N73, Sony Ericsson K800 and K850). As a mechanical way of stopping light making its way to the sensor, it takes care of the vertical stripes that appear in the highlights of high-contrast images also known as smear, as well as the wavy distortion that sometimes appears if you move the camera while shooting.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The camera UI of Nokia N86 8MP is the same as the one back in N85. It offers extensive settings - starting from manual white balance and ISO sensitivity (up to ISO800) and including exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast settings. Various effects are also at hand, labeled color tones. You can also customize the toolbar by deciding which options to appear and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice camera feature is geotagging, which by the way, works with videos, too. GPS locks are comparatively fast but you still might want to wait about a minute before your first shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An area where the Nokia N86 8MP disappoints compared to its rivals is camera features. We aren't talking about settings here but rather about those nice little perks that almost all midrange point-and-shoot cameras sport for quite a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words, there is no face recognition, blink detection or smile recognition. Not to mention the 120fps and time-lapse video recording modes found on the competing handsets. This is not an issue big enough to ruin the whole deal but it is nice to have them onboard a camera flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the panorama mode is present and it works pretty good. It automatically detects the direction in which you are rotating the camera and takes the shots at the required interval. The size of each individual shot is 1280 x 860 pixels but some of it gets wasted due to the vertical movement of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still we managed to make a 3-shots panorama with a height of almost 800 pixels which is pretty impressive stuff. And with the 28mm lens 3 shots are probably the most that potential users are ever going to need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP also offers a nicely customizable time-laps stills shooting mode that lets you leave the phone on a nice vantage point and have it shoot at custom intervals for as long as you want. The resulting photos can be compiled into some really nice looking videos if you have the little technical knowledge needed to process them on a computer later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did notice that the Nokia N86 8MP camera has some issues with the processing algorithm when we published our initial preview but now that we've gathered more samples, we are pretty certain there are some major flaws there. There are a lot of strange artifacts when rendering text and some are even evident on our test resolution chart (more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the best way to judge a cameraphone performance is to compare it to another one of the kind. The choice went naturally to the Samsung i8510 INNOV8, which is easily one of the best 8 meagapixel cameraphones released to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung handset has obvious advantage over the Nokia N86 8MP in terms of fine detail (fits less in the frame so uses more pixels to describe the same subjects) and its image processing is much more mature with no artifacts present. Even if you neutralize the larger field of view disadvantage by physically moving forward to shoot from closer distance with the Nokia than with the INNOV8, the N86 8MP still fails to resolve as much detail as the INNOV8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise reduction is also much more aggressive in the N86 8MP results, eradicating all fine detail and giving the photos a distinct oil-painting look. The photos however aren't any less noisy than the INNOV8, which either means that the N86 sensor isn't as good in this aspect or the algorithm is a total failure. Either way, the Samsung INNOV8 snatches a point here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range seems about equal on both handsets and so is the color balance. The INNOV8 has gone way off with the purple flower, which looks blue in its photo, while the Nokia reproduces the yellow building slightly more yellow than it actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed that the Nokia N86 is too easily susceptible to lens flare, resulting in washed out images in situations when the sun has been just about to peek in your frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go some more Nokia N86 8MP samples for you to enjoy:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally it comes the time for our studio resolution chart. This is a standard ISO12233 chart used for evaluating the synthetic resolution of digital cameras. It is an excellent tool for measuring pure horizontal and vertical resolution and also offers a good reference point for comparison of resolution between cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have also added a few touches of our own to the chart by sticking a color chart and a grey scale over it. The first one will allow you to see the amount of noise in the different colors as it tends to vary quite a lot from phone to phone depending on the sensor and the noise reduction technique applied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gray scale is there to provoke the usually more powerful noise reduction, which kicks in when shadows are involved. Once that happens, you will notice complete loss of detail towards the darker end of the scale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile the thin lines at the top of both the color chart and the gray scale illustrate the real-life effect of the noise reduction. You will notice that the numbers are barely readable with some phones and more easily recognizable with others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapping the chart with Nokia N86 8MP revealed the advantage it has over the 5 megapixel Nokia N97. It's tough to say which one is better when you compare it to the INNOV8 but it seems that the N86 has the slightest of advantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What that means is that the disadvantage the Nokia N86 8MP has in the real life scenarios is due to the flawed processing (which kicks in only in some cases) rather than permanent imperfections such as poor lens optics or design. We are just hoping that Nokia will make an effort to fix it with a firmware update - it won't be the first time we see that happen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>28mm add fun to video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the N86 8MP camera shoots in the now-midrange VGA resolution at 30fps. Videos are captured in MP4 format and can have automatic or manual white balance. The other available settings are night mode, exposure and color effects. You can also choose whether the dual-LED flash should be turned on to act as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving the fact that VGA is no longer top-of-the-ladder achievement aside, the quality of the videos is pretty good. There is plenty of resolution and the details are nicely sharpened. The colors are also well reproduced and the 28mm lens adds a really nice touch to the videos. The perspective changes more than one might expect and the resulting videos are quite interesting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting people<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is surely one of the elements of the Nokia Nseries models and the N86 8MP is hardly an exception to the rule. In fact the phone supports all contemporary data transfer means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 are a nice start of the lengthy list. All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - from ageing GPRS, through EDGE to 3G with HSDPA - the N86 8MP has it all covered. The HSDPA is limited to 3.6Mbps and there is no HSUPA which for a high-end device like this is a pity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100MHz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the wireless communication tally, Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. Unfortunately, the nice WLAN scanner plug-in present on all recent Nokia S60 smartphones in</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia N86 8MP has a memory card slot, which can at times provide the fastest data transfer rates. And with an 8GB card in the retail package all you need is a card reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser as good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP comes complete with an elaborate browser to make use of the great connectivity set. The browser has excellent page rendering and works in both portrait and landscape mode. The zoom level is easily controlled and the font size can be modified to fit as much content as possible on a single page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the optical joystick in Samsung i7110 and i8510 INNOV8 is the highest we have seen a Symbian browser go, the Nokia N86 8MP isn't too far from that standard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps are well known<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones can hardly be accused of lacking time-management skills. Even if you do happen to miss an application you need on your Nokia N86 8MP - there is plenty of third party software out there. However for most everyday use you will hardly need anything more than the package you get straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has the typical three different view modes - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel, PDF and PowerPoint files seamlessly. Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version - but that holds true for every other Nseries handset out there. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the complete application from the Nokia Download center for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other office application is ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP is equipped with a text-to-speech engine that can read phone content such as incoming messages or emails to you out loud. The text-to-speech options include different types of voices and languages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi here, Ovi there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typically for the latest Nokia devices the N86 8MP has tight Ovi integration. You may share with your friends all type of media via Ovi Share and see all the stuff your buddies have published.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Contacts did not come preinstalled on our unit&nbsp;despite the fact that it was advertized by Nokia. Anyways, it's free to download and so we did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the successful installation Ovi contacts appeared a new tab in the Contacts list. Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff. In addition you can even share your GPS location so your friends can view immediately where you are at that particular moment using the Ovi Maps. Or you can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to. What can we say more - it all works exactly as advertized. Your contacts need not have an Ovi-connected phone, they can chat with you just fine over Google Talk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>N-Gage powered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the hit-and-miss N-gage support in the N97 (some devices shipped with the N-gage client, while other couldn't even download it due to some incompatibility), it seems that Nokia have successfully managed to ship N86 8MP with full N-gage support right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some good 15 trial titles pre-installed and you can use the supplied N-gage serial number to fully unlock one of them, which you prefer. You can still enjoy the demos however, plus the games are really nice and most of them cost only a few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also plenty of third-party games out there, but they can hardly compete with the N-gage titles. Still, if you prefer those, you can easily download both native and Java titles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP has a built-in GPS receiver and comes with three months of free voice guided navigation through the well-known Nokia maps application, conveniently renamed to Ovi Maps. The application on our Nokia N86 8MP is the latest 3.0 version, which however is still in beta. There are no other differences besides the name - it offers the same functionality and controls. As usual it does an excellent job - especially when you activate the voice guided navigation that comes with a free three-month licence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took the N86 8MP under a minute to get satellite lock much like the time it took Nokia N79 or N85, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however always need an internet connection and cannot be preloaded on the phone in advance like you can do with the regular map data and the desktop Map loader application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3D view is also available in addition to the regular 2D mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N86 8MP also features a digital compass. It's available in Ovi Maps however in order for it to work, you need the map zoomed on your current GPS position. And don't forget to check if the phone magnetometer is turned on from the Settings menu and activated by swinging your hand around for a minute or two. If all these requirements are fulfilled you'll see the small compass icon lightning in green and the map will automatically rotate as you do - unless of course, you are in active routing mode. In this mode the compass doesn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional features like traffic information and city guides can also be activated but they come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in case you are still unhappy with Nokia Maps you can go for a third-party application and there are quite a lot of those available. User reports indicate the internal GPS has no problem working with any of the more popular third-party navigation apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the smallish screen on the Nokia N86 8MP can hardly be considered a treat for using as a full-featured satnav device. Still, it can fill in when you need an occasional location service and thanks to the electronic compass it will be especially handy when you're on foot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with stating the obvious, the Nokia N86 8MP only brings one major upgrade over the N85. But it's the kind that is likely to make the handset a hot seller. Looks like quite a lot of people will be eager to buy Nokia's first 8 megapixel cameraphone. And this time they'll be treated to more than just old glory. Because the N86 8MP won't settle for simply catching up in the megapixel chase, it tries to set the pace by introducing the industry leading variable aperture and a 28mm wide-angle lens - what a treat!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and while we're still at the obvious, the N86 8MP is good old (emphasis on old) Nseries. Great all-round performance is what you can expect in one of the most-complete smartphones on the market. A cameraphone, an N-gage gaming phone, a dual slider with a kickstand, a true Symbian all-in-one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scary as it sounds, the N86 8MP is not completely shielded against competition. Promoted to the 8 megapixel league in the nick of time, it finds itself surrounded by an alarming number of potential rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious challenge is taking place on its own Symbian turf. The i8510 INNOV8 is no longer the top Samsung smartphone or cameraphone, but it's still keen to tackle the Nseries newcomer. And by the looks of it, the N86 8MP has quite some to learn from its Symbian rival in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8510 INNOV8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of Sony Ericsson feature phones are also ready to play defense. It may look like an unequal fight, but a Cybershot (C905) and a Walkman (W995) with no gaps in the spec sheet may be strong enough to stand on their own against a Symbian smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson C905 ? Sony Ericsson W995 (Hikaru)</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GD900 Crystal</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not to mention Omnia HD, which may not be of the same caliber and form factor, but is too among the most revolutionary camerapohones this year with its HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8910 Omnia HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Faced with a hostile crowd of smartphones, touch phones and feature phones, the Nokia N86 8MP is ready to fire back with Nseries skill and some groundbreaking imaging gear. The image quality of the handset is hardly up to scratch at this point though (we've got a retail unit) and we can't ignore that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have got the hardware right however and the image processing is hopefully fixable through a firmware update. How the first Nokia 8 megapixel cameraphone fares against the competition is probably a short-term strategy. The important thing in the long run is the Nseries is done catching up and is ready and willing to discover.</paragraph>
