			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A nice little phone that looks fresh both on the inside and outside. That's what we took from our first encounter with the Nokia Asha 501 and we do hope we managed to get that point across. You know, with phones that go a dime a dozen, you always risk making it sound like a condescending pat on the head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 is better than that. Yes, it's an entry-level package. A cheap, dual-SIM phone that fits the Asha description to a T. Yet, it's a fresh take on the touchscreen dumbphone concept - in terms of both industrial design and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Nokia is no longer looking at the Asha lineup as a back-office operation or a way to hedge its bet on Windows Phone with minimum investment. After years of living on the Symbian leftovers, the Ashas are finally getting the respect and treatment they deserve. They have been consistent earners in developing markets but the Asha 501 is, for the first time, likely to make the lineup relevant on a larger scale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, bargain-hunters and first-time buyers continue to be the main target, but a winning combination at last of a fresh, contemporary design and neat and clever interface will certainly raise the Asha 501's prospects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nostalgic Nokia N9 users buying it for their kid, or people after a sensible - and perfectly capable - backup phone. Why not the kind of users too who value looks over features, or any other group of non-geeks. Though it might help if they're just geeky enough to get the joke in "My other phone is a Lumia 1020".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing about Ashas is that they'd been trying too hard to offer a near-smartphone experience on the cheap. They always got near but not quite there, and the build and finish were the usual casualty of a tight budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Asha 501, the Finns are on the right track to fixing both issues. There's nothing revolutionary in the level of equipment: there's optional dual-SIM support and Wi-Fi connectivity, the updated Nokia Xpress browser, a lowly 3MP camera and an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A capacitive screen is making the right difference (not a first for the series anyway) and there's even a proximity sensor - finally. A fact that speaks to the Ashas' rising standing in the pecking order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A fixed-focus camera and a low-res screen are things most users should be able to live with, considering the phone's price. No fast network data is a thing to consider but if you can't have both 3G and Wi-Fi, the latter is the more sensible choice, particularly in a cheap package like the Asha 501.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it's not all about the features. More importantly, it's a good-looking, compact handset with a battery that lasts. If it sounds like something you might be interested in, you're most welcome to read on. We'll tour the bright-colored exterior and then continue with the clever, swipe-driven interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia Asha 501<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's only room for the basics in the Asha 501's retail package. An old-gen Nokia charger is supplied, as well as a single piece pink headset (for the Black Asha 501 flavor). You'll also find a 4GB microSD card already inserted in the memory slot. There is no USB cable inside though. We should note however that the Asha 501 can charge off USB with standard microUSB cables and chargers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 501 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 is a pleasingly compact device at 99.2 x 58 x 12.1mm, and one that weighs just under 100 g. It's an absolute pleasure to handle - it fits snugly in the palm and everything on the screen is within comfortable reach - and that capacitive screen is quite responsive too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design and build of the Nokia Asha 501 has got little to do with the older Asha generations. And we mean that in all the good ways possible. The phone manages to make an impression with its colorful outer shell. The back cover that folds around the inner body comes in a candy-box variety of colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the 3" screen has an ample bezel, but that's nothing out of the ordinary in the price bracket. The bigger problem is that the black front is a bit at odds with the bright-colored rear. On a positive note, the capacitive touchscreen is quite responsive and comes with a scratch-resistant coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware Back button is the only control below the screen, the earpiece symmetrically placed across. The microphone is in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no brightness sensor but Nokia has included a proximity sensor, which turns the screen off during a call. The back button is pleasingly firm and springy, slightly raised above the surrounding glass surface and therefore easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 essentially breaks down to two parts, which is obviously the second most solid construction after unibody. The colorful shell folds around the inner body, resulting in a slim colorful frame around the screen as an accent. At the back we find the 3.15MP camera lens along with a Nokia logo and a nub at the bottom to push the phone out of the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used is nice to the touch, with a soft matte finish that completely rules out visible fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we quite like the Asha 501's design. The phone is extra pleasant to hold and work with. What we're most impressed with is how such a simple design makes a huge difference compared to the older Asha generation. The Lumia influence is easily spotted - a great way to update an old, stale look while providing consistency and continuity in the Nokia portfolio - from feature phones to smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eye-popping colors also add to the fresh feel of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nokia Asha 501 is a perfect mix of affordable and portable, but also good-looking and up-to-date.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Nokia Asha 501 is a 3" TFT unit of QVGA (240 x 320) resolution, which boils down to around 133ppi. That's not a lot by any standard, but in this class capacitive touchscreen with multi-touch support are still considered nice extras, so you shouldn't expect Retina-beaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are nice and punchy and the screen is reasonably bright. Size may be an issue, as well as resolution, but the responsiveness has been notably improved from what we remember with the older Asha phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the web and watching videos isn't the most compelling experience on a screen of that screen size and resolution of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the stats - contrast levels are pretty good thanks to the nicely deep blacks, but the brightness isn't particularly high.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB - it's an LCD screen so you wouldn't expect anything less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 features a power button on the right side, which will also lock and unlock the device, although you can do without it as the phone can be nudged out of standby with a double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker sits comfortably in the upper right corner of the phone. All three buttons (power and volume) are solid to press and easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia Asha 501 doesn't feature any controls. There's a dual-SIM version of the phone but it doesn't have a side-mounted SIM compartment, which was typical for Nokia dual-SIM handsets of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's the microUSB port, along with an old-gen Nokia charging port and a 3.5 mm headphones jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom holds no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back cover is easy - a light push on the nub at the bottom will do and the phone's bottom part will pop out of the shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then go on and take the phone out. Doing so reveals the 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery, with the primary SIM card slot under it in the very battery compartment. The hot-swappable microSD and secondary SIM card slot are on the side. This actually means they could've been accessible on the outside too but Nokia went for exchangeable covers instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery on the Asha 501 is quoted at 624 hours of stand-by and 17 hours of calls for the dual-SIM version and almost double the standby time for the single-SIM variant.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Updated Asha Touch takes after MeeGo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Asha Touch user interface has been known to heavily borrow from MeeGo, but the new Asha generation has really lost any decency - who can blame them really, it's a debt that will never have to be repaid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To Nokia's credit, it has done a pretty good job of porting stuff to the lesser hardware. We're as happy with the new interface as we are with the fresh styling of the handset. Scrolling and, rarely, swiping do feel a bit choppy but other than that it's a good-looking interface with a modern feel to it - a significant improvement over the Ashas of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the styling of the icons has barely changed but wallpapers are a welcome addition that gives some punch to the interface - along with much needed depth. When you scroll or swipe, the background responds too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting rid of the hardware call buttons is another step towards a decisively modern look. The single hardware control is the Back key, and it is only really needed when you need to go a level up from a submenu. For everything else, swipes and taps will do. A double tap will wake the phone up, swiping an app off the screen will close it. We told you, the whole thing is modeled after MeeGo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the usual video demo to get us started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen doesn't have any active shortcuts to directly launch apps but it will display notifications for missed calls, incoming messages or calendar events. These will take you right to the relevant app, be it the dialer, calendar or messaging. A tiny number icon on the Messaging icon in the app launcher shows the text messages you have received but not yet read. That works for email too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double tap will nudge the phone out of standby and display the lockscreen - you need to enable the option in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the preceding Asha Touch version, the interface was built around a three-homescreen setup: the app launcher, the phone app (or Radio, or Music Player) and a pane to fill with app shortcuts or favorite contacts. There're only two homescreens now - the app launcher and the so-called Fastlane. It's a similar setup to what Windows Phone does with the Tile screen and All Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fastlane keeps track of all your recent activity, opened apps go there, along with contacts you've called, calendar events (birthdays, to-dos) and social network posts and goings-on. Not all apps are available in the Fastlane - the Settings, Browser and Camera, among others, didn't appear in the recently opened list - Alarms, Facebook and Gallery do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player will appear in the Fastlane only if you've played a track - that makes sense really. What you get is a line with the track name, a tap on which will take you to the Music Player app. Alternatively, a tiny play/pause button next to the track name, will simply resume or pause playback without going into the app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is a 4 x 4 grid, up from 3 x 4. All the apps you install reside here and you can rearrange them as you see fit but you cannot create folders. A tap and hold inside the app launcher triggers edit mode, where you can delete apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap to expand the status bar or pull it down to show notifications for missed events and quick toggles for sound profiles, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data. The two SIM cards have their icons in the notification area with the network ID and the custom names you gave each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a missed call, which requires your attention, the notification area drops down a bit to briefly display the number and then pulls back up, leaving a small handle as a reminder, which you can pull to see who's been calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To close an app you just need to swipe it away from either end of the screen and you'll be back to the app launcher screen. You can also close apps by holding the Back button but for some apps you'll get a prompt to confirm you want to close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps give you a context menu, which is accessible via a swipe from the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is a vertically scrollable list of settings, which is easy enough to navigate. The first options are connections, which lists Flight mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the SIM menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next menu handles Personalization - it lists the options for sounds and wallpapers. Glance screen is an option for the lockscreen, which displays a permanent clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the SIM menu you can enable Mobile data, check out the counters for calls and data. You can also choose a new name for either SIM, select Fixed dialing, change PIN and Network selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface runs reasonably fast and is easy enough to navigate but could've been smoother - scrolling animations could certainly use a higher framerate. Once you get a feel for the swipe navigation there's really no way to go wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you open an app by mistake it's only a swipe from either edge of the screen to exit and get back to first base. The notification area comes in handy for toggling quick settings like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and spares you the need to open up the settings menu. Recently opened apps are just a swipe away in the Fastlane.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays a list of names and pictures only. There is a search field at the top and a hidden alphabetical scrubber on the right. A swipe up from the bottom of the list gets you the Advanced menu and an Add new contact shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual contact details are displayed on a completely redesigned screen. You get the contact's picture on the left and the contact's name right next to it. There is also a small star on the right which will promote the contact to your Favorites list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, mail address, ringtone or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - SIM 1, SIM 2 or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved, linked to another contact or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony works fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone app of the Asha 501 is pretty straightforward and works well. In the new Asha touch interface it integrates with the Call log and the Dialer and that's more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is pretty standard, but sadly it doesn't offer smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're about to place a call you're prompted to choose the SIM card to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both SIMs are active at the same time and you can receive calls on either line - the ongoing call is put on hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call screen shows options for the keypad, muting a call, putting it on speaker, holding it and entering contacts. If you leave the in-call screen the status bar will notify you of an ongoing call and within a tap on it you'll be back to the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reception with the Asha 501 was consistently good and in-call sound was loud and surprisingly clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've put the Asha 501 loudspeaker through our traditional test and we found it loud enough not to miss many of the calls and notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in lets you delete the conversation. Creating a message is pretty straightforward. You can add multiple contacts from your phonebook or simply punch in numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text entry, you can choose between a multitap keypad and a QWERTY keyboard (the default option). You get a character and message counter either way. Unfortunately, there's no text selection or copying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose to attach an image, video or audio file, your message will be automatically converted to an MMS. If you opt for an email instead a phone number, you'll be also sending a multimedia message instead of a regular one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is completely redesigned and we found texting on the Asha 501 extremely easy despite the small screen and keyboard keys. The accuracy of the keyboard is really impressive. Both portrait and landscape modes of the keyboards are available as well as text prediction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default email view mode is Inbox but Folder view is supported too. Multiple emails can be deleted using the advanced menu at the bottom of the screen. You can switch between accounts from the Mail client's homepage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on an email will allow you to reply, delete, star, forward or mark it as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and a small asterisk appears over the Mail icon in the app drawer when a new email has arrived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chat client supports multiple services - Facebook, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, Yahoo and Nokia Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Useful file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has a long tradition of supplying file managers on S40 handsets and the Asha 501 makes no exception. The nicely functional app has a clean interface that first lets you select between phone memory and the SD card. You can mass copy, delete and move items and folders, create new folders and sort by name, size, newest and oldest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery offers editing options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Nokia Asha 501 has two tabs - the all captured tab, which holds all the images and videos you've captured with the Asha 501 and the folder view, which gives you the captured, favorites, modified and received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are shown in a grid of three by three that is vertically scrollable. You can pinch to zoom on images but strangely double-tap doesn't work here. You can also share photos via email or Bluetooth and edit them. Editing options include rotating, flipping, cropping, lighting and contrast adjustment and adding color effects. The edited images go into the Modified folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set images as wallpapers, add them to favorites, see details and start a slideshow from the pull-up context menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501's music player has a neat interface and starts up with album art on top of the available sorting options: songs, artists, albums and playlists. There's no folder view and no additional settings for sound, such as an equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen shows the timeline, album art, track and artist name, along with four toggles - skip, FF, play/pause and a home icon which takes you back to the start screen. The now playing screen features a pull-up context menu from the bottom of the screen, which gives you options to fav a song, shuffle, repeat and share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The song will keep playing even if you exit the player - you get a shortcut in the Fastlane and on the lockscreen with play-pause-skip controls readily available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a dedicated video app that has all of your videos in a scrollable list of thumbnails. You can share, delete or view detailed information from the swipe-able menu at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 is capable of playing 3GP/MP4/Xvid/DivX videos up to VGA resolution, but you can experience some hiccups with the audio if the bitrate is higher than the phone can handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers very basic user interface with just a Play/Pause button and a scrubber.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stereo FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia Asha 501 comes with a neat and simple interface. You can change stations with the dedicated controls on both sides of the centered tool for manual station tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there are three controls - a star to fav a station, play from speaker and a list of your favorite stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the music player, the FM radio will keep playing when you exit the app - you get a shortcut in the Fastlane and on the lockscreen with the station information and an off switch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 501 does decently well, achieving some good scores and garnishing them with nicely high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones leads to a rather large spike in intermodulation distortion and a moderate one in stereo crosstalk as well as a rather big drop in volume levels. Overall, the Asha 501 does well, although it's not quite in the same league as the best in the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3.15 fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 has a 3.15 MP camera which is capable of capturing images of up to 2048 x 1536 resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple - it offers a virtual on-screen shutter, a toggle for switching between camera and camcorder and a gallery shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a tap you get a zoom slider and the additional settings option. There you'll find adjustable white balance, self-timer, live effects and shutter sound, which can be disabled too. You can also preset the resolution of the images with a choice between 3MP, 2MP, 1MP and VGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the specs suggest, images produced by the Asha 501 aren't anything worth writing home about but they will do for the occasional visual memo (not for fine text though - no autofocus is a deal-breaker here) or contact picture. There isn't too much fine detail, but there are occasional purple fringing, over sharpening and pink spots. The colors are nicely punchy though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>3MP shooters are getting very rare these days, but there are still plenty you can compare the Asha 501 against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Asha 501 in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video at 15 fps fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video capture, the Asha 501 was way out of its depth. The camera can produce QVGA (240 x 320) videos with a framerate of 14fps. Sound is recorded in mono at 31Kbps and a sampling rate of 16kHz, the video bitrate hovers around 400 Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can tell, those videos are hardly good for anything and we can't see anyone actually using their Asha 501 for video capture. Still if you are interested in the results you might check out this untouched QVGA@15fps sample video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 is a dual band device (900 / 1800) and offers GPRS and EDGE class 12. There's no 3G (HSDPA) or Wi-Fi on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Wi-Fi b/g, which will get you faster data speeds and it doesn't eat into your data plan (if you have one to begin with). Bluetooth 3.0 with EDR handles things like wireless handsfree dongles but also local file sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging. There is no USB on-the-go support, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 501 also has a memory card slot (and a complimentary 4GB microSD card). Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data-efficient browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 has Wi-Fi, but sadly no 3G data speeds. Still, the Nokia Xpress browser uses server-side compression so it offers a passable experience on EDGE networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's tabbed browsing and you can save favorite websites as tiles in an Opera-like speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a neat start page with categories such as Featured, Mail, Sports, Social Networks, Entertainment, etc. The pull-up context menu gives you quick access to recent, favorites, downloads, web apps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings of the browser let you choose the quality of the preloaded images, from lower to best quality. Images can be disabled altogether too. There's a password manager as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing experience isn't spectacular on the Asha 501. Pages load reasonably fast but don't look their best on the tiny 3-incher of QVGA resolution. Still, the Asha 501 will certainly let you check the score of your favorite team's last game or browse through the news websites.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 501 is decently stocked and its apps have been nicely touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day view is also available but week view has gone missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding event has been unified and instead of various options available, you have a single interface. You can set start and end time, reminder, location and repeat interval. You can mark the event as a birthday which will set it to repeat automatically every year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses two rotation rings, making it easy to set the time and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple alarms are available, unlike previous version of the alarm app for the Asha platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing features include a voice recorder with 2 hours limit and a basic calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notes is a mandatory app for every organizer and despite the basic interface, Asha 501 Notes app does the job right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also pre-installed Facebook and Twitter clients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weather app is available as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Store and bonus apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories - Applications, Games, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a feature phone having an app store at all is a major bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a part of joint promotion by Nokia and EA, Asha 501 owners even have 40 games developed by the popular studio waiting for them in the Nokia Store - all for free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 501 is a great reboot of an already widely popular lineup. The no-nonsense Asha phones have built a reputation for offering great features at an amazingly cheap price, but until now it really lacked in the "fun to use" department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great news is that changed as Nokia introduced the completely revamped UI called Nokia Asha software platform 1.0. It's not only fresh, but it's also the closest an Asha has even been to a touchscreen and while the budget nature of the whole lineup means developers are never likely to fall in love with it, at its core the platform is not far from a basic droid or WP7.8 smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what does that mean for the Nokia Asha 501 and its prospects? Priced at just under &#x20ac;100 for the single-SIM version, the handset faces very few natural rivals, so offering this kind of solid performance makes it quite a hot prospect. Add another &#x20ac;10 and you get a second SIM slot join the Wi-Fi connectivity, FM radio, 3MP camera, and the cool design on the list of assets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's doesn't sound like a bad trade, but let's see if you can do better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 311 offers a snappy 1GHz processor with 128MB RAM, bigger WQVGA display protected with a Gorilla Glass, and better 3MP camera with VGA recording on about the same price as the Asha 501. It runs on the older version of the Asha UI, though, and it isn't nearly as solidly built, so we'd say you are better off spending the extra &#x20ac;10 and getting the Asha 501 on this occasion.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There are a couple of Android smartphones from this year batch that successfully compete with the Asha 501 price tag - the LG Optimus L3 II and the Samsung Galaxy Star S5280. They both offer dual-SIM versions and QVGA screens (3" for the Samsung handset and 3.2" for the LG smartphone) to go with the Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, since these are bottom of the barrel droids, the performance is far from perfect - lags and holdups are a rather frequent sight and even if Project Butter tries to mask much of it the CPUs inside simply can't keep up with the platform requirements. If you are of the patient kind, however, you will get far greater versatility with the two droids than you would from an Asha 501. Even excluding those that are too heavy for the limited chipset, the Optimus L3 II and Galaxy Star S5280 have access to tens of times more apps than the Nokia handset.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Then, there's Nokia's own Lumia 610 from the company's last year batch. Powered by the WP7.8 platform, the Lumia 610 is the clear winner when it comes to hardware - a Scorpion CPU and a 3.7" display of WVGA resolution really dwarf what the other contestants here have to offer. There's also more storage, 3G with HSDPA and the free lifetime navigation thanks to Nokia Drive. There's no dual-SIM version here, though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In the end of the day Nokia Asha 501 brings a number of features on a bargain price, which combined with its fresh look and solid build quality is bound to attract a large number of customers on a tight budget. At this point though, it's flying way too close to smartphone territory to be comfortable - it's up to Nokia to fix that with a price cut and set things right.</paragraph>
