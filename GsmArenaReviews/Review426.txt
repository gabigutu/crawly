		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's impossible to deny Microsoft's influential position in the entry-level smartphone market over the last few years. The company has always managed to deliver compelling budget packages at hard-to-beat prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While success has never been a given for any low-end smartphone, Microsoft seems to have perfected the formula. A light and resource-efficient OS such as Windows Phone has certainly helped. Microsoft's devices are typically capable of matching and beating the speed and performance of their Android peers with less processing power and RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 however is the first budget smartphone to run Windows 10 - which marks a new stage in mobile software for the Redmond company and a step towards platform convergence. It's too big a step though for the Microsoft Lumia 550 but even without the Continuum support, the phone isn't without its merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, the 4.7" screen has 720p resolution, which is quite a confidence booster at this price point. There's LTE support as well and a 5MP main camera - a feature Microsoft carries from the previous generation. The exterior hasn't radically changed and the polycarbonate case is simple and practical. While it may not be the best choice for the flagship Lumia 950, the plastic finish is perfectly fitting the budget Lumia 550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, Microsoft has done most of the things right. We're not quite sure about the choice of the Snapdragon 210 chipset - perhaps the high-res screen ate into the budget available for the chipset. LTE support is there though and that must've been Microsoft's main requirement. Let's hope too that the chipset pays back in terms of better battery life too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, we can't help but notice the striking similarity between the Lumia 550 and last season's Lumia 640. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. On the plus side, it's nice that the Lumia 550 shares a lot with the flagship Lumia 950 pair in terms of looks, but the design is quite obviously getting long in the tooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to the Lumia 550 though than its looks. We're excited to see what Windows 10 has in store for the entry-level smartphone space. Before that, let's explore the hardware and what Microsoft changed about it. Or didn't.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lumia 550<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 retail package is a bit barren - the phone itself, some guides to get you started and a charger with a non-detachable microUSB cable. Pretty standard so far, but there's no headset or a separate microUSB cable for data transfer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While most in-box headsets are not high-quality and get tossed in a drawer somewhere, a USB cable always comes in handy, even if it's a short one, so we kinda miss that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 550 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 550 measures 136.1 x 67.8 x 9.9mm and weighs 142g. That's a bit heavy and thick for a 4.7" device, considering the 2,100mAh battery. The top and bottom bezels are also oversized, considering there are no stereo speakers or capacitive touch keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 and Lumia 640 are similar in terms of build and even measurements-wise, they're just a few millimeters and grams apart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 comes from the same mold as some of its predecessors, namely the Lumia 640. As such, it offers familiarity, but not much in terms of excitement factor. However, we actually prefer Microsoft's approach in the budget-oriented sector - reuse design and spend more on better screen and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The polycarbonate plastic is not the best quality material we've seen, but it has a nice matte feel to it. Have in mind, that the black version we tested is prone to collecting smudges and fingerprints. The alternative white model should hopefully be more smudge-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, there's a 2MP camera that shoots modest 480p video. It's certainly not the new king selfie camera, but will be good enough for Skype videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a proximity and an ambient light sensor on the top right. The earpiece and mouthpiece are cutouts in the front glass and are hidden under a metallic mesh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only hardware buttons on the phone are on the right side. The Volume rocker is fairly comfy to use though the Power button is a bit low, especially if you try to push it with the thumb of your right hand. There's no shutter key here and we miss the times when Microsoft deemed those mandatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired ports on the Lumia 550 are split between the top and the bottom - the 3.5mm audio jack goes up top, while the microUSB 2.0 port is situated down under.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is positioned on the mid-line on the back, but it's some distance off the top edge. This leaves you enough room to put your finger there to hold the phone steady, without covering the camera and smudging its lens. A single-LED flash is next to the camera to be used for low-light shots and flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The small round grille for the loudspeaker is in the lower right corner. The camera and speaker are pretty flush with the back, which is good design-wise, but leaves the camera lens open to scratches and muffles the speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the back cover comes off, giving you access to the battery and the card slots - one slot is for the microSIM card, while the other one is for the microSD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 550 employs a 4" LCD screen with 720 x 1280 resolution. This works out a pixel density of 315ppi, which brings the Lumia 550 in the Retina display territory of the iPhone 6s (326ppi) and indeed it's visually quite sharp - we couldn't wish for more in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a microscopic image of the screen's RGB matrix - it does come with a standard pixel arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text and images render smoothly and even small fonts are fairly readable. Colors are nice and punchy and viewing angles are quite decent too. There's only little color and contrast loss even if you look at it at an extreme angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 has excellent maximum brightness of 546nits. The contrast is about average based on all phones we have tested, but it?s certainly very good for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of color accuracy, the Lumia 550 LCD screen is clearly not color calibrated (Avg. DeltaE 5.2) but we?ve seen worse even from flagship phones. Even better, you can work with the provided Color Profile setting to adjust the output by making it warmer and slightly less saturated and you would get a much more accurate result (Avg. DeltaE 3.4). Going to a warmer color representation however would bring the maximum brightness down to about 505nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone did fairly okay in our sunlight legibility test, the screen is a bit reflective, but crank up the brightness and it is usable outdoors in a bright sunny day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 550 battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 is equipped with a 2100 mAh Li-Ion battery and the manufacturers promises some nice battery life numbers such as 670h+ standby battery life and up to 14h of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our test, however, the Microsoft Lumia 550 managed an endurance rating of 42 hours. We were quite disappointed from the phone's video playback results of a nudge over 5 hours. It's important to note that at 50% brightness, the phone's display outputs 200 nits of brightness, which is relatively higher than recent phones we tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make note that our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows 10 Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 550 is among the select few to come with Windows 10 Mobile right out of the box. It builds upon the established principles of Windows Phone 8, but comes with an entirely new OS core, very similar to the one inside the full-blown desktop Windows 10 and the Xbox One's Windows 10. This is part of Microsoft's strategy of unification among its device lineup and should help developers easily deploy apps across the different devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 takes up around 5GB of storage, leaving you with less than 3GB on the Lumia 550. Happily, you can move apps and games to the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Windows 10 Mobile is fairly familiar, though refined and polished. There is the Live Tile homescreen, the all apps list, the action center with toggles, and a tightly organized settings menu. All seems the same and yet once you begin using it, you appreciate the numerous little ways that it's better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few components of the Windows 10 Mobile UI we'd like to mention, and those are in the order you'll encounter them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick off with the Glance Screen, which is an important feature in Windows 10 Mobile and, while it doesn't looks as good as, say Lumia 950's AMOLED display, it's equally useful on the Lumia 550. It displays a monochrome clock, the date and number of missed notifications. You can opt for night mode (warmer colors), display intervals or always on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 Mobile supports only two homescreens, just like Windows Phone 7 and 8. The main screen has all your live tiles, static icons and folders, while the second screen has a scrollable list of apps. You can resize the tiles as usual, and pinning a tile is very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Center is your place for four customizable toggles and all notifications in Windows. It works just like on Android OS - you access it by pulling down from the top of the screen and you can dismiss all notifications at once if you like. You can expand all toggles as well with a second swipe down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft likes Apple's way of handling apps running in background - most of the apps are suspended upon hitting the Windows key and will be resumed once you bring them back. There are others, of course, such as Navigation, Cortana and Battery apps, which will continue to run in background unless you specifically forbid them. So, any app, which needs to run in background, will do so, while the rest would get suspended.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Cortana does what Apple's Siri and Google Now do - it recognizes your voice commands and questions in natural human language and gives you spoken replies and feedback. It shows a very nice summary of your day upon launch (the weather, events and meeting, important news, sports scores), based on your location, search history and predefined interests (in your Notebook, which you can edit any time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can fully interact with your phone and carry out all kind or commands related to it. Cortana can also track various news topics, makes suggestions for cooking and dinner, plan trips, find places and make reservations, make jokes, among other things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like where Microsoft is heading with Cortana - it may have been around for a short time, but it has already caught up quite impressively. Keep in mind that as of the time of writing this review, Cortana is still a regional feature, which may still not be available in your country.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Windows 10 Mobile is an excellent match with the Lumia 550. The Snapdragon 210, however, isn't the best chipset to make the experience of the new OS as smooth as it should be.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub hasn't changed much since Windows Phone 8.1 It is the phonebook that you'll find on any Windows device and supports multiple accounts, including social ones, and has multiple pages like the rest of the WP interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell reception and call quality with the Lumia 550 are very good and we had no receptions issues or unpleasant sound problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker on the Lumia 550 scored Very Good in terms of loudness. Its audio quality is OK, but not impressive, as the sound isn't very deep, but that's ok.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with Skype integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 Mobile now fully integrates with Skype and once you sign in, you actually don't need the Skype app at all. The Messaging hub now supports Skype IM messaging and you can sent and receive Skype messages as they were texts/MMS. Attachments are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has made the QuickType keyboard even faster and smarter, plus there is a new dot, which acts as a virtual D-pad and allows you to move quickly through the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client is the mobile version of Outlook Mail. It looks a lot like its desktop app and works like a charm. It supports multiple accounts, and syncs across all your Windows devices. It is available on Android and iOS as well and we often prefer it over other solutions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the first noteworthy new apps in Windows 10 Mobile is Photos. Its default view is an overview of your entire collection of pictures (sans the screenshots). It is also capable of aggregating all of your OneDrive photos and listing them along with your camera snaps. Microsoft gives you 30GB for free plus 3GB for the each device on which you turn on the automatic OneDrive camera upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live images are available as well. If the option is enabled from within the camera interface, your image will open as an animated picture similar to Apple Live Photos, sans the 3D Touch gimmick. The live picture is stored in a standard jpg container, but only the Photos app of Windows 10 (Mobile, Desktop, Xbox One) can actually display the image animated. For all others image viewers/editors - it's a static image with double the size though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Groove Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app in Windows 10 Mobile has gone through some major changes. It is now called Groove Music, named after Microsoft's music streaming service. Groove Music service is integrated within the app and offers streaming and downloading music the same way Google Music and Apple Music does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groove Music sorts your local music by albums, artist, songs and playlists. It covers all the usual requirements for a music player, supports editing playlists and comes with a nice and clean interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groove Music app supports playing back the music you've uploaded onto your OneDrive storage, which is potentially quite useful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 comes FM Radio-enabled, but in most regions there is no FM radio app pre-installed. You can grab a proper app from the Windows Store and listen to FM stations using a headset connected as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this functionality may be locked entirely for some countries and also you'd need to get a headset separately as there is none in the retail package - at least ours came without one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is better than the price suggests<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 did very well when plugged in an active external amplifier. While its volume levels were only average, it posted great clarity scores top to bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones harmed the stereo crosstalk moderately and it also introduced some intermodulation distortion and frequency response fluctuations, but none of those is too major a deficiency. Volume levels remained flat for a solid performance overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera does the job alright<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 makes use of a 5MP autofocus camera. The sensor is the 1/4" type and the lens has a f/2.4 aperture. The camera is accompanied by a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia camera interface is perhaps well familiar - it offers adjustments for white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speeds and exposure. You can choose between 4:3 mode and 16:9 samples, there are no other resolution options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed the Lumia Panorama app from the Store just recently and the default Windows Camera app does not support panoramic images. Microsoft previously stated that it will be removing all Lumia lenses, and yet it doesn't provide an alternative. You have to rely on a third-party app/lens for pano shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP images taken with the Lumia 550 turned out quite good, with reasonable amount of resolved detail. Contrast is good. Unfortunately, a lot of our test shots came with the white balance off. Noise can also be somewhat of an issue - even in daylight but we are happy with the overall processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2MP selfie camera isn't as good. It manages to capture somewhat detailed and sharp images, but don't expect stellar white balance, contrast or dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we've added the Microsoft Lumia 550 to our Photo Compare Tool. We've pitted it against the Samsung Galaxy J2 as well as the LG Nexus 5X for the lack of a third, similarly equipped competitor in our database of tested devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video camera is subpar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5MP snapper records 720p video. The clips we took have a bitrate of 8Mbps and a framerate of 30fps. The single-channel audio is 192Kbps, 48.0KHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the quality of the videos - it's hardly exciting in terms of resolved detail and contrast, but perhaps we're spoiled by more expensive phones. The videos are quite smooth with a constant framerate of 30fps. If you're into video taking, you might want to take a peek elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also grab a raw camera sample taken from the Lumia 550 - 00:15s (15.5MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 also takes part in our Video Quality Compare Tool. Check out how it manages to compare to the similarly equipped Samsung Galaxy J2 and the more expensive LG Nexus 5X.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Edge web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Microsoft brought their new web browser - Edge (previously known as Spartan) - to Windows 10 Mobile as well. It looks a lot like the IE11 we saw in the last Windows Phone 8.1 OS, but it's lighter, faster and with an even simpler interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It supports bookmark sync with your Microsoft account, there is Reading list, Reading mode, incognito tabs and download manager. A Find on page option is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Edge renders pages great, it's fast and we can safely say it is catching up with Chrome on Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile comes with a rich preinstalled set of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First - you get the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Creating, viewing or editing documents and presentation is very easy, as is taking notes and checklists. It's the best office suite out there and it has tight integration with OneDrive, which means you will be getting all of your files synced across all of your devices, no matter the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneDrive is onboard of course, with 30GB free space for starters. Its user interface is getting friendlier by the day and it's a nice alternative to Dropbox, especially since it's tightly integrated with Windows 10 on both desktop and mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All other usual organizing tools are available - there is Outlook Calendar, Alarms, Calculator and Weather apps. The Calculator is quite like the one you would found on the desktop Windows - it supports scientific and programmer calculations as well as various conversions such as volume, length, weight, temperature, energy, speed, time, power, pressure, and angles, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated Xbox app is here too, you can view and compare achievements, chat with your friends, invite them to game sessions, as well as edit your avatar. You can shop Xbox One and Windows 10 apps from here as well, and they will later install on your console or PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new Windows Maps app, based on Here map data, allows you to search for places, view nearby POIs, and, of course, it can do turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation. Offline maps are available, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Lumia 550 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 offers great build-quality and neat, simple design. The black polycarbonate cover is more fingerprint-prone than the white one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased with the 4.7" 720p LCD display, which has excellent brightness and contrast</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have yet to properly test the battery life, but the outlook so far is not that bright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 Mobile is on the right track, refining the interface and catching up with features and services. It has tight integration with Skype, Office and OneDrive, it offers an Xbox app and satellite navigation with full offline functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise, the Lumia 550's Snapdragon 210 chipset feels slow and going through the Settings menu and changing stuff certainly takes its time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 550 scored Very Good at speaker loudness but the speaker sound quality is hardly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output quality via the 3.5m audio jack however is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player managed to play almost every video format we threw at it, except those files with AC3 audio encoding. There is subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera quality is very good despite the not so reliable auto white balance. It offers good detail, nice dynamic range and manual controls, the latter being quite unique to this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The captured videos are limited to 720p resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 is a low-cost smartphone and it looks like one. There's little on the outside to suggest you're dealing with an important milestone in smartphone history such as Windows Mobile 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, no big story behind the Lumia 550 - just the next installment in Redmond's entry-level lineup. Great things ahead for the platform but the budget handsets will not get a piece of Continuum. Not right now anyway. But to be fair, this should not be held against a phone that genuinely tries to build on a proven formula and ticks the right boxes in terms of user experience and build quality, at a very competitive price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By now it should be clear what Microsoft has been focusing on with the Lumia 550: the screen and camera. The Snapdragon 210 is an OK chipset, but it just doesn't like to get nudged into action. LTE is duly covered though and we can hope further optimizations to Windows 10 would result in a smoother overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Windows 10, it comes with a few tricks up its sleeve and a number of improvements both on the surface and under the hood. For the first time it ties together the App Stores of the mobile and desktop OS to bring Outlook, Office, Cortana, OneDrive and Xbox all under the same roof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft was clearly reluctant to splash on the chipset but the Lumia 550's display is great for the price. It's sharp and lets you further tweak the colors for an almost calibration level color accuracy, which not many low-end smartphones offer these days. What you'll have to deal with, and pretty soon too, is the 8GB of internal storage. It's of little use, considering Windows 10 takes more than half of it. A microSD card will be an obligatory purchase with every Lumia 550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 550 is in the sub ?150 category and will inevitably face fierce competition from the Android camp. Let's see what the Lumia 550, which has it's price recently slashed to sub &#x20ac;100, has to deal with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a few comparable offers and some start cheaper than the Microsoft Lumia 550. The Galaxy J2 has a slightly more powerful chipset and a similar 5MP camera, but it cannot match the cool 720p display of the Lumia 550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly larger Galaxy J5 is better in every way, but its price tag matches the specs. If you're willing to spend ?60 more, you're in for a Super AMOLED screen, Snapdragon 410 chipset, a larger 2,600mAh battery and a 13MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy Core Prime is even cheaper than the Lumia 550, but not by much. Here, you're sacrificing the display with a 4.5" WVGA screen. However, a Snapdragon 410 and a similar 2,100mAh battery will do their best to bring things back into balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Leon is similarly priced and rocks WVGA resolution on a 4.5" display. The Leon is equipped with a smaller a 1,900mAh battery, but has a Snapdragon 410 chipset. The 5MP camera also records 1080p, which isn't a small feat in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also offers the Magna, a 5" 720p smartphone with a Mediatek MT6582 chipset and Cortex-A7 quad-core CPU. Sounds like it's worth the ?10-20 on top of the Lumia 550's price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has the Xperia E4 Dual and Xperia E4g Dual in the budget range. The Xperia E4g Dual sports a 4.7" qHD display, but is powered by a MediaTek MT6732 chipset with a quad-core Cortex-A53.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E4 Dual is larger with a 5" qHD screen and sports a quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU and 1GB of RAM. Its 5MP main camera records 1080p, while the front cam does 720p. Both phones are similarly priced as the Lumia 550, but we aren't fans of qHD displays anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Xiaomi Redmi 1s, which is an excellent alternative for nearly half the price. It's not so easy to get one but the package is nearly impossible to beat: a 4.7" 720p screen, a Snapdragon 400 chipset and an 8MP camera. It runs a rather dated Android 4.4 KitKat though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, the Lumia 550 is rocking a brand new OS even though it just cannot take advantage of all the benefits of Windows 10. Yet, the very fact is certain to bring more attention to the budget handset, which looks like a perfectly good phone for the price.</paragraph>
