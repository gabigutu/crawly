			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's J-lineup is being fully renovated and the 2016 badge on the model name implies meaningful updates - albeit subtle, which is understandable. After all, this is the Koreans' economy class of smartphones. But the series is obviously important enough for Samsung to even add new digits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The J3 (2016) here is in a slightly different boat from its siblings. The J5 (2016) has its predecessor from a year ago, the same goes for the J7 (2016), even the basic J1 (2016) and J2 (2016). With no J3 from last season, Samsung is clearly enriching the selection and it's worth noting that there is a Galaxy J3 Pro in existence as well, but it seems intended for the Chinese market only. That one is technically a 2016 model too, released a mere month ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the J family has proven quite popular among value-conscious smartphone users in developing and mature markets alike. The new generation has a solid base to build on, and that definitely applies to even a fresh newcomer such as the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that Samsung did well to achieve is a full house of display sizes with the J series, a point that is still incredibly important. Whatever your needs and preferences may be, Samsung has you covered with a "J" device. They all come with the company's trademark Super AMOLED panel from as small as 4.5" WVGA in the J1, to 5.5 HD in the Galaxy J7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the allocation of features and overall performance, as well as battery life, isn't quite as linear across the lineup. The power-efficient 14nm Exynos 7870 SoC in the J7 (2016) is obviously the most potent engine while the rest of the family is getting the likes of S410 or a budget-class Exynos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) does come across as a compelling package. For around ?140, you get a versatile and well-made device, with a nice and sharp AMOLED display, a decent Chinese-made quad-core SoC, 1.5GB of RAM and a surprisingly well-optimized TouchWiz that makes the most of them. At least, that's what it seems from the surface. Well, join us as we go deeper than that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) comes in an ordinary white box, which doesn't contain much other than the basics. You get an AC adapter (5.0V/1A) and a USB cable. The charger is even less powerful than the 1.5A one in the J5 (2016) for some reason. You do also get a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) has a bit wider bezels than the J5 (2016) or the J7 (2016), but Samsung has still tried to keep the overall look and feel consistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is quite compact with a footprint of 142.3 x 71 x 7.9mm and tipping the scales at 138g. Bear in mind that this includes the 2600mAh battery as well. And even better, it is easily user-accessible by simply popping the plastic back cover - a useful feature that is becoming less and less common with the push towards slim, metal, unibody designs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware Overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) shares the same overhauled and modernized design of its bigger and more expensive siblings. However, in terms of materials, it is much more reminiscent of the previous generation in that it relies entirely on plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, thanks to clever coatings and painting techniques, the body does give off a metal look. Other than that, the small details are taken straight from the new Galaxy J design manual. The frame is chamfered at the front and back while the sides are finished in the phone's main color. They're also flat, for better grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, the plain plastic cover of yesteryear is replaced by one that imitates brushed metal. While there's a camera bump, it's not irritating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the main speaker and LED flash, they are still where you would expect them, on either side of the camera. These two are rather reminiscent of Samsung's older design language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the Galaxy J3 (2016) display is not afraid to flash some oversized bezels but it's actually alright. Below it, there's Samsung's traditional Home button, which feels nice and responsive and gives pleasant feedback. It's surrounded by a capacitive Task switcher on the left and a Back button on the right. A quick double press of the Home key would start the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's a front-facing camera on the right. Unlike the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), there is no front LED flash, just the earpiece and proximity sensor. The phone lacks an ambient light sensor as well so the brightness level can only be adjusted manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is on the right while the volume rocker is on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, you'll find the microUSB port and the main (and only) mic. The top houses the 3.5mm headphone jack only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals the 2,600mAh battery as well as the microSIM and microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Galaxy J3 (2016) manages to punch above its budget in terms of look and build quality. Everything is nicely finished, tightly put together and just feels sturdy. The weight distribution is a little uneven, but still, the phone feels nice in the hand.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) is equipped with a 5-inch display which, like it or not, is set to becoming the new compact. Yes, the J-series even has a 4.5-incher in the J1 (2016), but that one is really an entry-level model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of the Super AMOLED variety, obviously being made available to even smartphones as low in the pecking order as our J3 (2016) here. It's pleasingly sharp (294ppi), with rich colors and superb contrast - pretty much the screen alone justifies the handset's higher-than-average price tag, considering some of the direct competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would choose the excellent contrast that the J3 (2016) has to offer over a lower-midrange LCD any day of the week. And, with a brightness of 331 nits, the panel is perfectly adequate even in bright light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Outdoor mode, the display gets even brighter at 468 nits. This means that you shouldn't have any issues using the Galaxy J3 (2016) in any conditions. It is bright enough and has a 3.523 ratio. Yet, one thing that gives away the budget nature of the J3 (2016) is the lack of auto brightness mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for color reproduction, it would be both naive and unnecessary to expect sRGB calibration from the budget handset. Still, it maintains a fairly low average deltaE of 7.3. There are also a few Samsung display modes to choose from. In Basic mode, colors are most accurate, whereas AMOLED cinema notably oversaturates things. The middle ground is AMOLED photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a predictable Samsung fashion, the Galaxy J3 (2016) is available in single-SIM and dual-SIM variants, so you can get some flexibility in terms of carriers and plans. It is also worth noting that opting for a dual SIM option doesn't limit the use of a microSD card, as it has a dedicated slot of its own - another merit quickly being lost to slim unibody designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's try and get the chipset situation straight, as it has important implications on connectivity. Some units are powered by Spreadtrum SC8830 or SC9830. They have practically no difference in performance, but the former is only 3G, while the latter supports 4G LTE. If you get an Exynos 3475 unit, it will also have 4G support and the same goes for the alleged Snapdragon 410 variant. We weren't able to conclusively prove or disprove its existence, despite our best efforts, but it might very well be a reality on certain markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get Wi-Fi, but it only operates on the 2.4GHz band, so needless to say there's no Wi-Fi ac support. There's GPS with A-GPS and BDS on some markets, Bluetooth v.4.1, and an FM radio receiver. Sadly, unlike the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), there is no NFC in the J3 (2016).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also worth noting that the Galaxy J3 (2016) only has an accelerometer and a proximity sensor on board. That means no magnetometer or gyroscope - both essential for some apps. However, we can't imagine too many prospective buyers will be looking to use it with Google Cardboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) is powered by a 2600mAh battery and we can't really complain about the capacity all that much, as the battery on the Galaxy J3 (2016) is removable - you can just pop the back cover and replace it. This, of course, means no need for bulky power banks, just pack an extra battery for the peace of mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) managed an endurance rating of 66 hours. There's a lot to be desired from the video playback performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do measure standby battery drain, and even though it's not included explicitly in the scorecard, it has its influence on the overall rating.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike its J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) siblings, the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) still boots Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, just like the previous generation of "J" devices. This is a little dated and hopefully owners can at least look forward to an update to Marshmallow. But, even in this state, the company's traditional TouchWiz UI wrapper manages to keep things consistent and provides an up-to-date experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the icon set is the most recent Samsung one, many color accents and menus, however, like the blue notification shade somewhat give Lollipop away. Although, even that point is arguable, as some Samsung Marshmallow ROMs do still use the aforementioned color pallete. The only things you are really missing out on are Google features like Doze and Now On Tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen follows Android trends with a list of notifications and a couple of shortcuts - dialer and camera. You can double tap the Home key to quickly launch the camera and the gesture does work surprisingly quick even on the J3's low-end hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The added weather info on the lockscreen is perhaps not standard Android, but it's useful enough and is also a typical Samsung touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprint readers is a luxury the "J" lineup is deprived of, which does mean you only get the traditional locking methods on - swipe, pattern, PIN and password. There's no Private mode either, even though Private mode can be set to use only a password on other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As some form of consolation, however, the Galaxy J3 (2016) has access to the Samsung theme store. The preloaded themes aren't that great, but the store has been progressively getting more variety lately. Themes can change the wallpaper and icons, but also some Samsung apps (dialer, contacts, messages) and the notification area. We wish there was a search field, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is quite normal. There's an option to change the screen grid between 4x4, 4x5 and 5x5, the smallest one is the default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has one scrollable row of quick toggles and some have text underneath like the name of the Wi-Fi network you are connected to. The only way to view all toggles is to hit the edit button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider is below the toggles. Instead of an Auto toggle it has an Outdoors mode that temporarily boosts the brightness (it switches off automatically in a while to preserve battery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has remained loyal to the vanilla Android way over the years and is still sticking with an app drawer. The Galaxy J3 (2017) comes with a nice assortment of pre-installed apps, luckily, without much bloat. It tucked away Google's mandatory apps in a folder and placed its home-brewed alternatives up front. You can disable apps you don't want (but can't uninstall the TouchWiz ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has partnered with Microsoft so you get OneDrive (you get 100GB free as a gift), along with OneNote, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Skype pre-installed. The 8GB of on-board storage can be a little cramped since around 5GB are taken up by the system and only 3GB are available to the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the higher-end Galaxys, the Galaxy J3 (2016) does not have split-screen multitasking. We are pretty sure that this is just as much a business decision as it is a technical limitation, since 1.5GB of RAM can only stretch so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Setting menu features Quick settings - a selection of the most used options you can use. Below that is the full list, though we prefer using the search function as the extensive features that Samsung has provided can be hard to track down among menus and submenus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's price-conscious "J" series was never really intended to hit big in terms of specs, nor is it the first place you would naturally look for a good performer. But, while the Galaxy J7 (2016) does quite alright in this department, especially the Exynos 7870 Octa one and even, to some extent, the J5 (2016) as well, with its Snapdragon 410, Samsung really dropped the ball after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The J3 (2016) can be picked up with one of a few chipset options: the rather old Exynos 3475 Quad, with four Cortex-A7 cores, clocked at 1.3 GHz and built on a 28nm process or one of the Spreadtrum SC8830/SC9830 duo, which only differ by modem with slightly faster Cortex-A7 cores, at 1.5 GHz. The Exynos chipset comes with a Mali-T720 GPU, while the latter relies on the Mali-400 and as you can imagine, both are quite the underachievers. We did our testing on the 4G model with a Spreadtrum SC9830. We caught rumors of a Snapdragon 410 version as well, but we couldn't confirm its existence just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1.5GB of RAM can only take you so far and while Samsung has really done a terrific job of optimizing TouchWiz to feel at home on the sub-par platform and work smooth, synthetic performance is really disappointing. A shame, really, as there are many other budget chipset offers out there that other manufacturers have really leveraged for a major performance advantage, even within the same price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start things off with GeekBench, which is great at giving us a reliable reading of raw CPU performance. We can clearly see the Galaxy J3 (2016) being severely outperformed by practically every competitor out there, with the exception, of its little sibling - the J2 (2016).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 6 is a compound benchmark but the Galaxy J3 (2016) doesn't really have any particularly strong points to make up for the CPU, so it understandably ranked quite low.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time for some GPU testing, where we don't really expect the Mali-400 to shine. In fact, it is such an old graphics processor that the only benchmark it managed to run is GFX 2.7 T-Rex - one we have been planning to phase out for some time now, as most current devices simply breeze through it. However, even in this department, the Galaxy J3 (2016) didn't even manage 8fps when rendering at 720p on its display - far from a playable rate. And when tasked with 1080p rendering, it struggled even more, barely putting out 4 frames per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, we wouldn't recommend the Galaxy J3 (2016) at all if you intend to do any Android gaming at all. Well, perhaps the most casual games of them all, but nothing really beyond that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark in both its general compute and graphics forms. Sadly, we can't really say there is any redeeming aspect of the Galaxy J3 (2016) and its performance to be noted here either. It is almost embarrassingly under-powered compared to other similarly priced offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (medium)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, benchmark scores for the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) are really poor, even by entry-level standards. Despite bringing usability down quite a bit, this doesn't bode well for long-term performance. While the fresh Android installation ran smoothly and we didn't experience any glitches, but Android does slow down a bit over time so things will probably be less rosy once you get all your apps up and running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming is a no-go right from the start, unless you are into light 2D gaming, and even then you might see an odd stutter here and there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) has a strong reception and good in-call audio. It comes with either one or two SIM cards (two micro), the Duos version has dual-standby. Only one card has access to 3G and 4G networks, the other is for 2G calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is visible behind the keypad (you can hide that to view the full list) and it shows which SIM was used to place/take the call on the Dual SIM model. You can also filter the log by which SIM was used. The other two tabs show your favorite contacts and all your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook is a list of contacts with a search field and an alphabet index. The contact info card has been cleaned up and shows the contact image (you can swipe down to view it fully), below that are the phones and emails with quick buttons to call/send message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you'll also find the latest messages and calls with that contact. The View more toggle displays all the additional info. You can swipe left to call a contact straight from the list, right to send them a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in call rejection feature lets you block calls from certain numbers or all numbers not in your phonebook. Do not disturb mode can be scheduled on select days and during certain periods of the day. You can set it to make an exception for certain notifications, including allowing only calls from your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single loudspeaker on the Samsung Galaxy J3 proved rather unimpressive. On a positive note, it does feature a slight bump, which is really a necessity, considering its position on the back panel. By contrast, the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) employ Samsung's new grill design that is absolutely flat and can be muffled a lot easier. Other than that, however, the Galaxy J3 (2016) was quiet in all three tests, scoring a final Below Average mark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default messaging app is Samsung's own Messages. It has a clean looking UI and lets you can customize font size, backgrounds and speech bubble style. You can use pinch zoom to change the font size in a conversation thread. We didn't find the custom wallpaper/bubble styles though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Receiving a new message displays a popup that lets you view or quickly reply to a message, a handy functionality that Hangouts lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A built-in spam filter weeds out messages from select numbers or containing certain phrases. You can also schedule messages to be automatically sent later (so you don't forget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-modified Email app looks almost identical. The top row is a shortcut to show emails only from just priority contacts or you can view a combined inbox if you have multiple accounts added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app also handles multiple accounts - even ones not on Gmail - and adheres more strictly to Material design principles. Add push notifications and we end up using it more often than the Email app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung keyboard features a dedicated numbers row. You can assign preset phrases to them so simple messages like "on my way" can be typed in a second. You can add text shortcuts (so 'brb' gets replaced with 'be right back') and there's predictive text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tweak the size of the keyboard slightly, making it taller or shorter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can update its database with popular words weekly and learn from your messages and contacts. Swiping can be set to move the text cursor or as an input method. Unfortunately, there's no floating mini keyboard though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the J3 (2016) has been borrowed from last year's Galaxy flagships, but with a slightly reduced feature set. The default view shows photos grouped based on time. Thumbnails are shown on a clean white background and you can change their size with a pinch zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing tools include simple things like cropping and making collages. There's no support for online galleries though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share button allows you to send a photo to a wireless printer, but the DLNA/TV sharing functionality is missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only Google Play Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's TouchWiz music player was one of the most feature-rich apps, but Samsung dropped it in favor of Google Play Music, at least in the budget-friendly "J" family, that is. This means no Sound Alive, not even an equalizer. But if Google Music is good enough for the Nexus phones, it should be good enough for the Galaxy J3 (2016).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a capable player for offline music play, it does online streaming too. You can bolster your music collection with stuff from the Google store too. And, if you prefer streaming, but don't want to necessarily pay for a subscription, Google allows you to upload your own MP3s to the cloud and enjoy them on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) also features an FM radio. It offers a clean dual-color interface and features RDS and recording. Although the latter is subject to local laws and regulations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is similar to the gallery. It supports all kinds of video file types and codecs, but don't count on the SC9830 too much for high resolution video. It feels comfortable at 720p and you should probably leave it at that. As usual, multi-channel audio (AC-3, DTS) is not supported out of the box and the same goes for DivX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pop-up video player is gone, but you can still beam audio over Bluetooth. There are extensive subtitle settings with adjustable font and text size, text color, edge and background. Multiple presets are available and you can make your own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is solid<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) started off well in our audio quality test. The smartphone achieved excellent scores for clarity when hooked up to an active external amplifier and had above average volume levels - it's more than we actually expected from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headphones test brought some intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk, but neither is too bad so we'd call this another good showing by the entry-level device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) only has 8MP at its disposal as a primary shooter. We know fairly well that megapixels alone are no reason to criticize. As the iPhone family can definitely attest, 8MP can go pretty far, but the sensor in the entry-level J3 (2016) can't really impress in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, as at least some form of conciliation, the camera UI is pretty unified among Galaxy phones, the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) even has Pro mode. It isn't as advanced as what you get on a Galaxy S or Note. All you get is sliders for ISO, exposure compensation and white balance but nothing on focus and shutter speed (the key settings for Pro mode, if you ask us).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting the Mode button gives you access to other goodies like Panorama, Continuous shot, HDR, Sound &amp; shot and a couple of others. On the viewfinder you also get some additional options including color effects and metering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of quality, the rear camera looks passable at first glance and it is, as long as you confine yourself to the 720 display. Once you offload photos to a bigger screen, however, the lack of detail becomes apparent - even for in the 8MP league. Colors also come out washed out and the occassional wrong white balance gives the photos a tinted look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the camera app launches really quickly with Samsung's universal shortcut - double press on the Home button. However, we would advise against trying to capture too many photos at once, as on our testing some of these photos ended up corrupted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its smaller sibling, the J3 (2016) does have HDR. It is a separate mode that you have to enable and can't just leave on auto, but that is far from its biggest problems. The effect it produces is very subtle and almost unnoticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama mode is actually really good. There is a noticeable lack of resolve detail, but, on the other hand, also absolutely no signs of stitching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't all that many 8MP cameras out there in 2016, but they aren't completely gone yet. Here's how the Galaxy J3 (2016) holds up against some of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016): photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front shooter is, like the main camera only adequate, considering its specs. Nothing special, no front-facing flash, just your average selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't expect much out of the video recording of the J3 (2016) either. For some reason it is limited to only 720p in terms of resolution, which is odd considering even the Spreadtrum SC9830 should be able to support 1080p, according to specifications. It might be a business decision, but it is a shame. Still, HD is good enough for viewing on the device and sharing on social media. There is no image stabilization, however, so handheld videos look shaky.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Browser and Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While Samsung dropped its music player, it kept its custom browser. It supports multiple tabs (including incognito ones), but the option to sync tabs between devices is gone. There's no fingerprint sign-in either (obviously, since there's no fingerprint reader).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome comes on most Androids as part of the Play Services package. It can sync tabs (based on your Google account) and has the data-saving option of compressing pages before they are sent to the device. It will even automatically detect foreign language sites and offer to translate them. In recent versions, Chrome abandoned the concept of spamming tabs within the app switcher and now they are back within their own little interface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other preinstalled apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, Samsung has partnered with Microsoft and offers a few preinstalled apps that you can't uninstall either. There's OneDrive to handle cloud-syncing needs (including photo backup). You get 100GB worth of bonus free space with your phone. OneNote for a more advanced note taking and syncing experience than the Memo app offers. Next, there is Word, Excel and PowerPoint. And finally, Skype is also on board to handle instant messaging and Internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Manager is a one-stop shop for maintenance of your device. It's divided into four parts. Battery shows estimated battery life remaining/time until charged and will warn you of abnormal battery usage. The Power saving and Ultra power saving modes can be activated from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storage section leans on Clean Master to free up some storage by deleting unnecessary files. RAM closes running apps to free up RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth section is Device security. It offers My KNOX, which create separate working spaces for personal and work apps (think BlackBerry's Balance). KNOX Active Protection promises to safeguard you against hacks - it's disabled by default for casual users and enabled for enterprise users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It slows down performance a bit and adds a few seconds to the boot time. What you get is verification that the system apps haven't been tampered with and has real-time kernel protection to avoid unauthorized access from apps to the core of the operating system. There's also a McAfee-powered malware scanner on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner is the familiar Samsung replacement for the Google calendar. Tapping on a day shows in Month view a preview of the scheduled events for that date. You can add a 7-day weather forecast and multiple calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is the built-in file browser. It's beginner-friendly with its Category view (e.g. view all photos), but you can browse the whole internal storage)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no Google Drive integration like in other versions of this app and no OneDrive integration either (despite the 100 gig bonus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder app features a single mode - voice notes. The option to automatically transcribe them has been cut. You can write down notes yourself with the Memo app, which lets you add checklists, images and voice memos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Good build and finish, phone is made to last. It may be all plastic, but it looks the part;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vivid display with excellent contrast and punchy colors. 720p resolution on a 5" diagonal shouldn't be an issue in this price bracket;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset can be found with quite a few different SoC's, which are hard to keep track of. The Spreadtrum SC8830 notably lacks 4G;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery is adequate with a rating of 69 hours, but the budget chipset isn't power-efficient enough considering the screen size and resolution. Video playback takes a heavy toll;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basic Android user interface experience, enhanced with just a dash of TouchWiz extras. The UI runs surprisingly smooth;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only 3GB of storage available to the user, which means downloading many apps from the Play store will be a huge hassle even if you purchasea microSD card. Luckily, the latter has its own dedicated slot, instead of sharing one with the second SIM;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is disappointing by 2016 standards. Gaming is not this phone's forte;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is on the quiet side and scored Below Average in our loudness test;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera produces nice photos, albeit with poor dynamic range and easily apparent lack of detail, worsened by aggressive noise reduction;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos come out fine considering the 720p resolution cap. Good enough for viewing on the device itself or for sharing on social networks. No image stabilization means shaky footage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) is one of those devices that will likely end up free-on-contract or a similar carrier-subsidized deal. There really isn't all that much about the handset to leave a lasting impression. Now that the J2 (2016) is officially out, this became even more apparent, as the two devices are identical hardware-wise and price-wise, only the J2 has the added novelty of Samsung's new Smart Glow notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, even though the J3 (2016) is a basic package, there is still a lot to like about the value-conscious handset, even though it reminds us how little has changed in Samsung's strategy in the low-end in past couple of years. Actually, the latter point will be illustrated even better by some of the J3's competitors and how far they've come. But even with its basic hardware, the phone still has one undisputed draw - the colorful Super AMOLED display, which not too long ago was actually out of reach for even midrangers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J3 (2016) might be a one trick pony, but if punchy AMOLED colors happen to be at the top of your wanted list, there is no easier way to get one on the cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, how cheap exactly? For starters, Xiaomi has you spoiled for choice even below the ?150 mark. The excellent value-centric Redmi family is right on the spot. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 has a 5-inch HD display, an octa-core Snapdragon 616 SoC, 2GB of RAM and a 13MP main snapper. And, surprisingly, you don't even have to go for the basic model - for the amount the Galaxy J3 (2016) would set you back, you could get the Redmi 3 Pro with a fingerprint reader, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 might actually be an even better deal. For about the same price, it somehow manages to bring the same features on a 5.5 FullHD screen. And if that wasn't impressive enough, it appears the company's ex-flagship is now within reach as well. The Mi 4 or, even better, the Mi 4c.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Meizu is not more than a step behind with a few budget offers of its own. The excellent Meizu m3 Note is definitely a top option with its Helio P10 chip, up to 3GB of RAM, 13MP snapper and 5.5-inch display. Then, we have the aging, but still high-end MX 4. It ups the stakes with its 1152 x 1920 pixel, 5.36-inch panel and 20.7MP camera and for just a few bucks extra, there is the MX4 Pro and its even finer 1536 x 2560 pixel, 5.5-inch display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE deserves a mention as well, with excellent offers like the Z9 mini, with its 5-inch FullHD panel, Snapdragon 615 SoC, 2GB of RAM and a 16MP camera. The same goes for Oppo and the F1 Plus, which has been selling like crazy. The LeEco Le 2 is also a prime candidate, with a 5.5-inch, 1080p panel and the powerful Mediatek Helio X20 on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to more readily-available options in the Western corner of the world, Lenovo has the Vibe K4 Note to offer with a 5.5-inch FullHD display, a Mediatek MT6753 SoC and up to 3GB of RAM, as well as the Vine Shot for a camera-centric experience. And we can safely add the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) on this list as it's a really close match to the Galaxy J3 (2016), but with the added bonus of near stock Android, timely updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess the list above helps explain where Samsung is coming from. In 2016, ?100 or so can stretch surprisingly far, especially if you start considering some online deals direct from China. Going down this road, however, inevitably means overcoming availability, warranty and after-sale service issues. That is likely why Samsung still feels relatively safe in pushing more of its under-specc'd entry-level phones through its behemoth of a supply chain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The use of underpowered Spreadtrum chipsets in both the recent J3 (2016) and J2 (2016) is an example of blatant cost cutting and the low performance of these chipsets defies the purpose of getting a smartphone in the first place. The low-performing chipset and the limited on-board storage would actually hinder proper enjoyment of a variety of apps and online services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get more bang for your buck from other manufacturers if you are willing to walk the extra mile, but if you are not, Samsung phones remain a safe and solid choice. If you're taking this road, however, our advice would be to try and spend a little more on your new phone as ?200 euro or so would get you an entirely different category of a device both in features and performance - all without any compromise in after-sales support.</paragraph>
