			<paragraph>Samsung E800 offers a very luxurious design, quality color display, excellent ringing and an integrated camera for a price above the average. It's not an impressive phone from the function point of view but it will probably suit the needs of most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Siemens introduced its sliding SL55 model, it caused a little storm on the mobile market. Nobody remembered the SL10 model from the end 90's and people were just mad from the flashing phone with a sliding construction. Time goes on and slide construction phones are becoming a trend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Siemens got more than satisfactory successor (Siemens SL65), Sharp TM100 appeared exclusively in the T-Mobile network, even Sagem introduced a slide conception model (Sagem myC-4). Samsung did its bit as well, first with the rather technical model SGH-D410, but soon also with the more attractive SGH-E800 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The likes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, Samsung SGH-E800 is a stylish phone, thanks to the renowned quality Samsung design and also for its size. Somehow it is said that a phone of this kind must be small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung E800 is really small</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find Samsung E800 in the T-Mobile network under the E820 designation but it's still the same phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What's inside the egg?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The whole phone is made of plastic, even though it looks like it's made of some kind of a fine metal. Most of its surface is of a matted white plastic, which looks at sight better than a drab silver color. But you won't be spared of that, because the front part, which is trimming the display and the soft keys, is silver. I can imagine also some other color variants but Korean designers won't hear a word against the silver color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to the rounded edges, the entire phone looks rounded. Comparing to the older Samsung D410 mobile phone, this model has an integrated in the body antenna. In the right upper corner where you should look for it, you'll find a slot for hanging the phone on a strap instead. Together with the phone you'll find an eyelet as well as a silver strap with an integrated handsfree in the package: you can use also a piece of an ordinary string.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Short eyelet - for the finger? ? strap slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the phone, just below the mentioned slot, you'll find the masked handsfree connector. I discovered it after quite a long search because it's very dexterously hidden behind the button. After removing the silver cover (it's fixed and you don't have to worry that you might lose it) you'll find a connector looking like a small USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Connecting the handsfree is not comfortable ? headphone can be placed in a clip ? bigger part of the handsfree cable is hidden "in the string"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the contrary, the silver label, placed a bit lower, can't be removed. It's an authentic button and is used for camera control. On the bottom part of the mobile phone there is a charger connector, protected by a non-fixed cover, which you'll probably lose early. Left side of the phone is occupied by a volume double-button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Buttons and infrared port on the side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with a magnifying glass you won't find a camera lens on the backside. Except an incised Samsung sign and a web address there is nothing at all. Yes, there is a battery safety lock taking a small place, but that's something inseparable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Look under the battery ? camera lens, mirror and a light diode are on the inner side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera appears when you slide the top part of the phone. A camera lens with a mirror and a flash diode are hidden right there to avoid dust, shocks and scratches. It's not possible to shoot with a closed phone, but this minor inconvenience protects the lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still the same display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is on the front side of the mobile. There is nothing to reproach for; it's the same quality as displays with other Samsung mobile phones. After Samsung came with a 262 thousand color display in the SGH-D410 model, I expected that we'll find similar displays with all following phones of the producer. But the time still hasn't come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display and keypad illumination</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thus Samsung E800 display can show "only" 65K color shades. It has 128 x 160 pixels available, which is today's standard resolution. It's an active TFT display, with physical size of 28 x 34 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where is the oval?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keys are in a form of small ovals. With outside columns these ovals are cut on one side, and the bottom row of keys is deformed in the same way. The oval size is changed so if you close the phone step by step, the top part covers only one row of keys. Keys in the middle column must exactly joint the edge of the top part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad detail ? keys are surrounded by a raised edge</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something else is important for practical use. Keys have sufficient distance from each other so there's no danger to press some other key than the one you want to. Their stroke is quite small but the press works well. Overall, the keypad of this phone is good above the average.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only numeric keys on the bottom part of the phone. The top part is occupied by display and several control keys. The four-directional control button is dominating. Each direction is assigned to some of the traditional functions - camera, ringing tones, calendar access and messages editor. Unfortunately it's not possible to change the assignment, even if you consider ringing tone change as not important and you'd rather use the button to access the phone book or run your favorite Java game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Center of this button is highlighted in blue and it starts the WAP browser. Fortunately you won't press this button by mistake whenever you open the phone, because a small rubber strip is placed under the display where you can put your thumb at rest. Just a short note about the way of opening, which is easier by Samsung comparing to other producers. You should just get over the initial resistance of the spring and then the top part goes by itself to the end. It's a big difference in comparison with e.g. Siemens SL65 where the opening goes quite stiffly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Top part of the phone slides on slim guiding bars</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next you'll find two soft function keys, green and red earphones and a correction key "C" on the top part. These keys are sorted kind of randomly at first sight. I prefer previously used ellipse of jammed keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Here on the rubber strip you can rest your finger ? function keys detail </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Menu new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After entering the main menu a diehard Samsung fan may experience a heart attack. He will probably switch the phone off and check it from all sides to assure himself that it's really a Samsung phone and not some Nokia or Sony Ericsson - the menu is absolutely the same. The excellent animations known from former Samsung models are gone - the menu is formed as a matrix of nine icons, which are a bit animated. Next menu levels are in a text form; the way it was before. Of course you can select functions on any level by using numeric shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung and matrix main menu ? next menu level style</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Whom am I going to call today?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can save thousand of multi-item records in the phone memory. Add a phone book stored on a SIM card that is displayed simultaneously, and you get quite sufficient capacity. You'd certainly appreciate the growing number of phone numbers, which can be related to one person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display in standby mode ? entering a phone number ? dialing a number</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So with every contact, besides the name and surname, you can have four phone numbers, one fax number, an email address and a text note. You can sort contacts to several groups, assign them special ringing tone and even picture. And with the integrated camera you can have an actual photo for every contact in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the phone book by entering name stepwise. Unfortunately it isn't possible to synchronize the phone book with a PC, the included program can load at once only the whole phone book or selected items to/from the phone. The ringing sound can play 64 voices, but melodies sound the same as with former Samsung phones. Either I am not able to tell the difference or the producer used old melodies, or growing number of voices has no impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the message menu you'll find that Samsung E800 can send, beside normal text messages, also MMS, that are becoming more and more popular. It's nothing to wonder about, a phone with an integrated camera, which cannot send an MMS would be a real shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Messages main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During text message writing the phone displays the number of remaining characters and also the number of message that you are currently writing. The phone supports T9 dictionary. You can set whether it will send messages in standard GSM alphabet or in a short length in UNICODE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Text messages editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia messages can consist of more pages, however total size can't exceed 100 kB, due to the restrictions from the GSM providers. Besides pictures MMS can also include sounds that you can record during message creation. As with Samsung E700 you can use this feature as a voice recorder, because you won't find such in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Multimedia messages editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I miss the email client. Partially we can substitute this shortage by using the multimedia messages. Samsung offers to send a message (text, pictures and sound attachments) to an email address. Moreover we can insert up to twenty recipients. Unfortunately there is not way to compensate for the missing support of the POP3 protocol for downloading emails to the mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We'd like a megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated camera can shoot in resolution 640 x 480 pixels only and cannot record a video. When you make pictures in dusk you can turn on a light diode to help. It's not a real flash, but it manages to light the night scenes after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Light diode functionality: normal mode on the left, using a diode on the right</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you'll use the diode or not, you have the possibility to choose from four different quality levels. Also special night mode and self timer are available, you can rotate pictures during shooting and also put them into funny frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung takes pictures on width while the display is height oriented. How to deal with this situation? Most of the phones don't show pictures on full display but only in its center. Samsung has chosen the worse possibility: during shooting you see only a central crop and side parts are added to the picture after you press the release. Forget precise composition. Update 26 Jan 2005: Press "1" during shooting to fit the picture in the display (Thanks, Mark).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Taken scene is shown on full display ? pictures gallery ? picture detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature is the sequence shooting. Depending on selected resolution the phone can take up to fifteen of successive photos. If you get tired from normal pictures you can turn on some of the effects. It will help you to create grey, negative, sepia or outline pictures. There is 22MB of memory available for saving photos, which I find absolutely sufficient. Take a look at the samples and decide for yourself, but our opinion is that the quality of the photos is well above the average for a VGA camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Snooooze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung features three types of alarm. Two of them are named Alarm1 and Alarm2, the third is called Morning call. They differ just by the possibility to postpone the warning at the Morning call, so you can snooze for few more minutes. All three alarms are repetitive and all of them allow you to tick days when the phone alarms you. So if you'll get bored someday, with suitable combination of these alarms you can create a sophisticated system of alarms for the whole week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Setting the alarms </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're quite limited at alarm melody selection. You can't use all the melodies available, there are only five different tones to choose called Alarm1 - Alarm 5, what an imagination :)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar week still begins with Sunday and you can't do anything about it. It offers you two basic views - monthly and daily and it works with colors, which are used for highlighting days with an event. Events can be of four types - memo, to-do, call, and birthday. You can insert hundred of items in total, twenty-five of each kind. Looking at total memory capacity (22MB) you'll probably ask the same question as I did: why does Samsung save the memory right in the calendar?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Month view of the calendar ? event detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is quite simple, but besides four basic mathematical operations it can handle also brackets and percents. It prefers multiplication and division to addition and subtraction. Units converter can tell you for example how many square yards is your piece of land large and what is its value in Euro. Countdown timer and stopwatch are the further functions of time organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calculator ? units convertor</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pleasure comes before business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You have only two and a half megabytes from total 22MB of memory available for saving Java applications. Producers occupied approximately 400 kB with two pre-installed games - falling color balls (very nice Tetris variation) and a snowball fight. You can download other games, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connection to the Internet runs via GPRS class 10 (4+2 TS). If the WAP browser is not enough, you can connect the phone to a PC via infrared port or a data cable (not included in standard package). But it's a pity to degrade such a nice phone to a mere modem, don't you think?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Wap browser</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good, but Samsung can do better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Prime advantage of Samsung SGH-E800 will be the design, that's for sure; price will be the prime disadvantage on the other hand. The functions of the phone are sufficient for most of the people and I think that most of the reproaches I wrote in this review won't discourage the common users. Nine out of ten people won't use an email browser or synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a bit different with the video recording possibility. I am sure that also less technical skilled users would use that. Many people would mind the small capacity of calendar, as it's an often-used feature. Approaching the style of the menu to other phones would be also appreciated. Looking at specifications I can't keep from the impression that Samsung can do better. With D410, which I've mentioned many times, Samsung came up with many new features that would be suitable also for the new model. Beginning with the 262k display with very good resolution and ending with e.g. an email client. Samsung E800 really doesn't show off from the functionality point of view. From the software point of view it's the same as last year's E700 model, with the same pros and cons. And that's perhaps a pity.</paragraph>
