			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo F1 is the ambassador for a whole new potential line of handsets within the manufacturer's portfolio and as such, it definitely deserves some attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, despite the lofty "F1" title that instantly sparks up images of Formula One cars or fighter jets, swooping at phenomenal speeds, the Oppo F1 has no actual aspiration of blowing users away with performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the contrary, the 5.0-inch phone has its roots set firmly in the mid-ranger realm. It sets out to offer some decent hardware, wrapped in a very signature Oppo-style body, akin that of the R7 line, all the while keeping pricing more reasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of pricing, Oppo seems to have a rather odd pricing policy, with the R7 often going for more than the R7s, so, hopefully, the F1 can help bring some order. Cheaper or not, the Oppo F1 is still a very nice-looking phone. We still find it rather refreshing to see Chinese companies exploring a design language of their own rather than simply shadowing industry leaders, like Apple's iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides its charming, albeit familiar exterior, the Oppo F1 has another trick to lure potential buyers - a superb selfie experience, or at least that is what the marketing team has decided to focus on. The Selfie Expert is definitely a catchy tag line and the team is justifying it with the 8MP front-facing camera with an aperture of f/2.0. The tiny shooter does look impressive on paper, especially considering it is on board a phone that costs around $250. However, a digital camera is only as good as its software and processing, so we'll make sure to check its virtues for ourselves. But, more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Oppo F1 doesn't really shine with any particular point on its feature list. Even more so, with the increasing number of interesting budget offerings, these days $250 can definitely get you more power or a bigger, higher resolution display from manufacturers like Xiaomi or Meizu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Oppo has been happy to offer similar hardware in the R7 line so far for lot more money, so the F1 still has its place in Oppo's current lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What follows is a short and sweet review (shorter than usual, anyway) to get you through the most important aspects of the Oppo F1, while keeping our impressions and observations brief and to the point.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have seen any of the R7 models - the Oppo R7 or R7s or R7 lite, then you could easily confuse the F1 for being just another member of this device family (there is also a R7 Plus, in case you were wondering). The design is almost identical and Oppo has also endeavored to carry over as much of the materials and build quality it can.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The F1 is advertised as being made of an metal alloy and you can tell it's metal by the way it can become really cold, though Oppo's description is anything but straightforward - "an exquisite metal alloy, treated with zircon sand surface coating applied in a low-pressure, low-speed spraying process". However, we can't wholeheartedly agree with the "exquisite" part. Due to the soft touch finish it doesnt really feel like metal. There is no actual flexing or give in the body to complain about, but the back just doesn't feel quite right to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, we are fairly certain that the frame is not metal, although they still feel and look just as nice. Speaking of which, Oppo also puts a lot of accent on the fine details in the F1's curves. It is nice to see that the 2.5D display glass has been carried over from the R7 line and the rest of the, so-called "Micro-arc" frame generally fits nicely as an extension to the existing angle of the screen curvature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the controls on the F1, Oppo has stuck to the familiar R7 distribution. The front of the device is clean. Despite its lofty aspirations, the selfie shooter is still relatively small, so it doesn't stick out like an eyesore. Beneath the screen there is a standard set of thee capacitive navigation buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen itself doesn't feel as responsive as we're used to, but it might be due to the factory pre-applied screen protector though that would be a first. Anyway, you would probably be fine without it either as the front glass is Gorilla Glass 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the back of the phone, we already had our say about how the metal feels there. A soft touch finish on a metal back just doesn't feel right to us - but that's nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The signature square camera is placed in the left upper corner and so are the two plastic segments on the top and bottom. There are also the cutouts for the speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two sides are the typical affair as well. On the left there is only a volume rocker, while on the right we have the power button and hybrid dual-SIM/microSD card tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone only has a lone 3.5mm audio jack and the bottom isn't much busier either, with a micro USB port, flanked by the main microphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is one area where the Oppo F1 definitely punches below its price range. As already mentioned, $250 can definitely buy you a FullHD panel from a variety of other vendors. At 5.0 inches, the IPS, LCD panel is rather underwhelming and doesn't really offer much to impress with. It is the most notable downgrade compared to the R7 and R7s. Still, unless you go out of your way to look really hard, you won't really find any grain or lack of detail on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much more troublesome, however, are the relatively bright blacks, which subjectively, ruin the contrast for us. The actual value is pretty close to the mean within our database, so, it is more of a subjective observation. Contrast is a little below average, sunlight legibility is also decent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo F1 is equipped with a 2500mAh sealed in battery, which is perfectly decent for a mid-ranger, especially one with a 720p display. Furthermore, this is a bit more than the R7 and R7 lite, which have 2320 mAh batteries, but still less than the 3070mAh in the R7s. That being said, there is no point in beating about the bush, the Oppo F1 has an underwhelming battery life, at least in our experience with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It only managed to score an overall endurance rating of 58 hours and that is with only one active SIM inside. Throwing a second one in brings the number down to 56 hours. Talk time isn't particularly bad at 12:53 hours, but it is still only half of what the Oppo R7 is capable of. Web browsing and video playback are also on the low end, but the score is at least consistent with the one on the R7. Besides the talk time, the other real culprit for the significantly lower endurance rating is standby with around 7 to 8 percent easily being drained overnight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important note to make concerns Oppo's VOOC technology, or rather, the lack of it. Oppo's patented fast charging tech is still one of the best implementations around, but sadly, the F1 lacks support for it altogether. And it is also not simply a matter of getting a VOOC charger - using one did not help, we tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make note that our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The F1 is one of a growing number of Oppo handsets, which are running on a Lollipop-based Color OS build. In this case, it is version 2.1.0i, but little has actually changed since Oppo upgraded to an Android 5.1.1 core. In this respect, The Oppo F1 has it better than the original R7, which launched on KitKat, as it did take Oppo quite some time to jump on the Lollipop bandwagon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is quite understandable, seeing how ColorOS is simply based on an Android core and makes it nearly unrecognizable, with a custom lockscreen, homescreens, icon packs, a custom task switcher and settings menu, as well as extensive theming support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have never come across ColorOS before, then there are just a few basic facts you need to know about the OS and its design ideology. We already mentioned the Android core and you can generally expect most any app to run on the platform, but optimization and performance are sometimes an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, process management is not exactly standard, so your mileage may vary with apps depending on specific services running in the background. So far we've found only one such app, but it's enough to prove that Oppo's phones handle background process differently than the phones by major brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another big piece of the ColorOS proposition, as with many other custom ROM's out of China, is a customized permission and notification management model. You can generally allow or deny granular permissions per app, the same goes for notifications and the autostarting of processes. It's certainly a lot more than what vanilla Android 5.1.1 would give you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI itself is slick, filled to the brim with lots of animations, transitions, as well as lots and lots of styling and customization options. There is no app drawer within the launcher, you have to make do with the home screen panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another big notable part of ColorOS is the myriad of gestures it supports, from double tab to wake and sleep, all the way to quick navigation, fast app launching and even custom gestures, you can define yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, the Oppo F1 is lodged firmly in the mid-ranger realm in terms of hardware. The observation that a 720p display is a little underwhelming considering its price tag and today's market is also absolutely valid. We also made the point that the F1 resembles the R7 line so closely that it is odd it is not actually part of it. However, be that as it may, the handset has one quite definitive feature to set it apart from said sibling, namely a new chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It might not be a benchmark breaker on any kind, but the Snapdragon 616 inside the Oppo F1 is a clear upgrade over the 615 model. Despite the single number increment in the model name, the new silicon is undoubtedly more powerful with all eight of its ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.7GHz. This might not come close to the bit-churning power of any of Qualcomm's 800 series chips, but is still quite sufficient for a complete Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to illustrate our point, we put the Oppo F1 through our standard benchmark routine and pit it up against a few other devices that we deemed close enough rivals. We won't go into too much detail, but the definitive conclusion is that the F1 can definitely hold its own against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, there are quite a few new mid-range offers that generally compete for the same crowd, like the Xiaomi Redmi 3 or the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). There are also some other notable offers, often slightly aging flagships in the mix, that happen to currently fit the budget and still pack quite a punch, like the Xiaomi Mi 4i or the LG G2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Graphics are typically a weak point for both the Snapdragon 615 and the Snapdragon 616, due to their shared use of the Adreno 405 GPU. However, one of the Oppo F1's weaknesses in terms of specs - the 720p resolution, is somewhat of a lifesaver when it comes to onscreen graphics performance. If you are into mobile gaming then opting for the lower resolution panel actually makes a lot of sense in this price group. That of course assumes graphic-intensive games are rendered in higher than 720p resolution on competing phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera experience is center stage in Oppo's marketing campaign for the F1. The phone features a 13MP main camera with f/2.2 aperture and phase detection autofocus. The camera is practically identical to the shooter used within the R7 family (perhaps even minus the Schneider-Kreuznach optics, but we can't be sure). So, considering the F1 is an overall cheaper offer, nobody is actually trying to pass it off as a spectacular camera phone, but rather a decent shooter within its price bracket. This is actually a statement we can support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has definitely put a lot of effort into the camera experience of the F1 and it definitely shows. The camera app looks fairly simplistic on the surface, with a hassle-free default auto interface, but hidden away is a vast array of powerful advanced features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, a quick tap on the settings button reveals quite a few interesting modes, like filters and video GIF's. Outside of effects and little novelties, there is also the slow shutter option that lets you manually control the shutter speed and also the Ultra HD mode that uses a clever stitching mechanism to produce photos with a resolution of 51MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, the real fun starts when you explore the More Functions option within the settings. From there, you can download a few extra camera modes, including Double Exposure, Super Macro and also a pair that really take the camera experience to the next level - RAW shooting mode and Expert Mode. The latter has Manual focus, exposure and white balance controls - all awesome additions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for quality, the 13MP sensor is definitely outgunned, but a camera is just as dependent on software, as it is on hardware. Manufacturers like Apple or HTC have proven time and time again that a lot can be achieved even with a rather low resolution cap. The Oppo F1 produced surprisingly good shots during our tests. Mind you, conditions were less than ideal, but we did manage to catch a few glimpses of sunshine. This nicer, but variable weather, however, does pose a bigger challenge to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shots have plenty of detail, as well as very nice contrast and sharpness. It is far from perfect, but, for its price, the F1 is definitely a versatile little photo studio, especially if you know enough to get your hands dirty and tweak things in Expert Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below are three samples, the first done in Normal auto mode, while the second has HDR forced. The third demoes the Ultra HD mode, which, we have to say, does produce some pretty impressive results, although it can't handle challenging lighting quite as good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at how the Oppo F1 stacks up against the competition in our Photo Compare Tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Oppo F1 in our photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, with a slogan like "Selfie Expert", it is clear that Oppo is keen on selling the F1 as a perfect tool for all your self-portrait needs. The front shooter is an 8MP one with a pretty wide aperture of f/2.0 but with a rather small sensor size - Type 1/4".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, as far as selfie cams go, this can definitely be considered as an effort on Oppo's side. A wider field of view would have made the F1 even more impressive in this respect, but, we can't really complain that much on a mid-ranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of shots from the front cam as well. They turned out pretty good, but nothing really that spectacular to back the lofty slogan up. Mind you, the second sample is done with Beautify 3.0 turned on to medium, which, despite being in its third iteration is just as over the top as ever. Palm shutter, on the other hand, is a convenient little addition to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video could benefit from some more detail and sharpness is not stellar either. But, still, the Oppo F1 managed to pump out a steady 30 fps frame rate and results were quite satisfactory. There is also an interesting slo-mo feature on board, but with an output resolution of 720 x 480 pixels, it is more of a proof of concept than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can use our Video Compare Tool to see how the Oppo F1 stacks against the competition when it comes to video capturing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo F1 represents an effort to retain as much of the elegance and high-end feel of devices like the R7 and R7s, while keeping costs down for a better chance on the mid-range market. And indeed, in a lot respects, the Oppo F1 looks to strike the right balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite a few cutbacks in materials, the Oppo F1 has the characteristic look and feel of its siblings, while also offering an updated mid-range performance, thanks to Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 616 SoC. Overall, the Oppo F1 looks like a perfect candidate for any price conscious buyer who doesn't want to sacrifice aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We realize $250 can get you a wide choice of Chinese-made phones. One such device that instantly springs to mind is the Xiaomi Redmi 3. It is available internationally for about $160. What you are getting is pretty close to the Oppo F1 regarding hardware - a 5-inch HD display, a Snapdragon 616, a 13MP camera. There are little sacrifices here and there, but the Redmi 3 has a much better battery life to show for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the Xiaomi Mi4i. It costs about as much as the Oppo F1 and has similar hardware. Its 5-inch display, however, is FullHD in resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another close contender would be the Huawei P8 lite, also frequently praised for its signature and exquisite aesthetics. Specs-wise, it is quite similar. Other viable options, albeit with slightly slower processors, include the Samsung Galaxy A3 (also metal) and the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen). There is also the option to shop for a now dated flagship, like the LG G2, but that's a whole other sea of options we won't get into.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until recently, Oppo has been striving to stand out by focusing on the premium segment. While this is not necessarily a bad strategy, Oppo phones are slowly finding themselves where Samsung or HTC phone are - their market positions severely undermined by the likes of Xiaomi or Meizu. These companies have been churning out attractive and affordable phones and have been changing the rules of the game for the other manufacturers. So the Oppo F1 is perhaps the first glimpse of a change in strategy, which will see even more competitively priced phones come out of Oppo's factories.</paragraph>
