			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is easily a phone you can pretend doesn't exist. And you don't have to try too hard either. The Meizu MX is something of a chimera. An iPhone body and a droid mind. It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to. For a phone coming from China, the Meizu MX has no qualms with imitation. But it's not a characterless low-cost replica either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strictly speaking, the Meizu MX is an Android smartphone, but it goes to great lengths to emulate the Apple iPhone in its strengths and even some of its failings. The result is a unique Android experience that differs from iOS as well - it's a very curious device, the Meizu MX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to deny that the Chinese company went all out loading up the MX for a fight. The phone packs a 4.0" ASV LCD screen of 640 x 960 pixel resolution (the same res as the iPhone 4/4S) and an Exynos chipset straight from the Samsung Galaxy Note (a tad faster than the one in the Galaxy S II).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressive stuff for sure, at least when you read the features off the specs sheet. Here are the rest of them, plus the disadvantages we found:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all perfect, but the Meizu MX can certainly go against a lot of Android flagships and show them a thing or two. But can it match the highly polished iOS experience and the trend-setting iPhone hardware?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tough question. After using the MX for a while, you get the feeling that Meizu went trough the trouble of emulating even the downsides of the iPhone. But then you notice things that you wish iOS and vanilla Android had. The same goes for some areas of the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're still not quite sure what to make of the Meizu MX, so this will be an interesting journey. Just try to approach it with an open mind, if you dismiss it as yet another replica, you'll miss out on an impressive (if derivative) device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, December 30: We updated the Meizu MX with the retail firmware, which runs the CPU at 1.4GHz (it used to be 1.2GHz before) and re-ran the benchmarks. Check out the results on Page 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing an engineering sample box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What we have in our office is an engineering sample, which means that this isn't the retail box. Still, it should contain the same things, so here we go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were no surprises here really. There's a compact charger with a USB port, which is where the provided microUSB cable plugs in to charge the phone. There's also a microSIM adapter, so you can use your card from the Meizu MX in other phones easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not sure if there's going to be a headset in the retail box. No one seems to have one yet, so we'll have to wait for the answer of this mystery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX measures 121.1 x 63.3 x 10.3 mm, which is roughly the same as the Samsung Galaxy S and slightly bigger than an iPhone 4/4S. The MX weighs 139 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX has a strong, undeniable resemblance to the iPhone - at least when you view it head on. Whether or not that resemblance was intentional doesn?t matter as differences become apparent as soon as you turn the phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MX's outer shell is mostly made of plastic and we have to say we're not big fans of it. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, while the white battery cover is much better. Still, the glossy plastic there isn't particularly pleasant to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beveled edges of the back are an instant giveaway that you're dealing with something other than an iPhone 4 or 4S. There's little chance of mistaking it for a 3G/3GS either - the camera placement is very different and there's no Apple logo, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the device is rather iPhone-like as we said, but the 4" screen is noticeably bigger than the Retina display even if you don't have the two side by side for direct comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is protected by Gorilla glass to ward off scratches. Its 640x960 pixel resolution is slightly higher than most competing droids (save for the ones with 720p screens) and with a pixel density of 288ppi it's really sharp-looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an ASV LCD unit, which in theory should provide great viewing angles, although the reality is different. Contrast loss becomes very noticeable as soon as you start turning the screen. Depending on the angle you tilt it, there's even a prominent color shift - grey turns to yellow pretty quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are nothing to write home about and the maximum bright ness of the screen left us wanting. Here are the brightness and contrast measurements for the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a very thin strip of metal running around the screen, which seems to comprise the antennas of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the other interesting features on the front, we have a narrow slit for the earpiece and a tiny, tiny video-call camera next to it, both sitting above the screen. Ambient light and proximity sensors are also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is where it gets interesting - the central Home key is small and rounded, protruding from the surface. That makes it easy to find by touch and it's fairly comfortable to hit, despite its small size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On either side of it are the two capacitive soft keys. They are rather special - a patent by Meizu actually. The context aware keys change appearance and function depending on what's happening on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left one is typically a Back key and shows a &lt; symbol but switches to a single dot when there's nothing to come back from (it serves as a lock key in this situation, it takes a press and hold to lock).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right one spends most of the time as a Menu key (displaying ...) but turns into a single dot when there's no context menu available. Here it gets slightly confusing - this dot won't lock the phone if you press and hold it. Instead, it launches a heavily customized task switcher. That also works when there's a context menu - again, you press and hold to activate the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all for the soft key tricks though - the capacitive controls are haptic enabled and they actually rotate their icons to match the orientation of the screen. Also, you can adjust the brightness of their backlighting individually from the screen and when you tap a key, it pulses brighter (even if they're at the brightest setting).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, such keys may not seem like much, but Meizu's implementation is really cool (and one of the highlights of the MX), so we wanted to cover them in detail. You can see them on video in the User interface section of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the tour will go pretty quick. The left side houses the volume keys while the right side is bare. The volume rocker is really uncomfortable - thin and quite flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top are the Power/Lock key, the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone for noise-cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is home to the microUSB port and primary microphone along with two connectors that are most likely for the dock. The microUSB port serves many duties - data connection to a computer, charging, HD TV-Out over a MHL link and S/PDIF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock sounds interesting, but there's not much info on it at the time of writing. S/PDIF is a common way to stream multi-channel digital audio, commonly found in home theater systems. If it can coexist with MHL, the Meizu MX combined with the dock can be an excellent media player option. We'll know more once details about the dock become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Meizu MX features the 8MP camera lens with an LED flash right next to it. The loudspeaker is also here, located at the sloping edge of the back. The loudspeaker doesn?t get muffled, but you should be careful with the camera - it can get scratched and is usually covered in fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover can be popped open to reveal the microSIM card slot, which uses a metal tray to get the card in and out easier. You can also see the battery, but it's not user replaceable (not easily anyway), as it's wired. The battery is a 1600mAh Li-Po unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX is comfortable to hold in the hand - it's not too big, too heavy or too thick. We wish the exterior was made of better looking plastic, but if you can get over that (or are going to use a case/pouch) there are no complaints about the build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it has its flaws, the hardware of the MX has a few tricks that can get the attention of serious buyers. Let's see if the software holds up this well - on to the interface section of this review, followed by some Exynos 4210 benchmarking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - Android is almost unrecognizable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu have thoroughly modified the OS and they're even calling it "Flyme OS" rather than Android. It still has the Android Market and will run apps from there, but the skinning goes deeper than what Samsung and HTC have with their TouchWiz and Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video that shows off some of the changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the slide up to unlock type, but borrows the idea of launching different things depending on what you swipe. The padlock icon just unlocks the phone, but you also have Phone and Message icons for the dialer/inbox too. These shortcuts are non-customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the homescreen is a panel with the time and date, which is joined by a panel for the track name when there's a song playing. Pressing the Menu button expands it to include music and volume controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is a fairly standard Android homescreen with a twist. You can put shortcuts, folders and widgets on the homescreen and there are three docked shortcuts at the bottom - dialer, web browser and messaging - that are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far so good, but here's the twist - there's no app drawer. All installed applications have their shortcut on the homescreen instead. That's an odd decision as you can't hide shortcuts of rarely used apps, the usual gesture for removing icons (dragging them to the bottom of the screen) uninstalls the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You only get three homescreens at first (there's an indicator for the currently active one), but as they start to fill up, you can grab a shortcut or a widget and drag them to the side and a new homescreen will appear. There's no overview mode where you can easily add, delete or rearrange homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned widgets - the Meizu MX came with very few preinstalled. There's the Google search widget, the service widget that turns Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/etc. on and off, a notes widget, a calendar widget and the News &amp; weather widget. That's it, there's not even a clock widget. If you want more, you'll have to get third party widgets off the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that each widget can be placed only once on the screen, even third party ones. So, the News &amp; weather widget (which has News, Weather and News &amp; weather modes) can be used only once - you can't have one for news and another for weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you can set the homescreen wallpaper as usual and there are quite a few provided. Live wallpapers are enabled too, but there's only the Maps live wallpaper preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is mostly unchanged except for one detail - it will only slide down as much as it needs to display the current notifications plus the Clear button on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more element of the general UI we need to cover - the task switcher. Actually, it's quite different from what you're used to in Android. For starters, it's launched by the Menu button, not the Home button. Also, it offers a lot more functionality than the vanilla switcher. Let's call it control panel, as "task switcher" is largely inaccurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's closer to the beefed up notification area of Sense UI. It offers toggles for Wi-Fi, mobile data, Bluetooth, GPS and syncing. Then there's the list of Wi-Fi networks plus a mobile network mode dropdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only then we reach the task switching bit. It's paginated and fits a row of four of the most recent apps per page. The leftmost page is a special one with a "Close all applications" button (you can close apps individually by a tap and hold). The number of pages grows as you open more apps, so you get a longer list of recent apps than the usual 6 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of all this, are the music player controls (previous, play/pause, next and a volume slider).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few more toggles available from the menu that pops up when you press and hold the Power/Lock key - they switch on and off the ringer, the vibration, airplane mode and GSM connectivity (those are two separate toggles) and the screen auto-rotate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more trick to the interface that eluded us at first - when you're scrolling through lists, you can tap the top right corner of the display (where the clock is) and the list will automatically scroll to the top. It's something that most people might miss, but can come in handy when dealing with very long lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's about it for the general user interface. We just want to note that screen transitions - entering and leaving an app, moving between menu screens - have been directly lifted from iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software behaved well most of the time but it would occasionally act up and cause problems we don't like seeing on a platform as mature as Android. Whether it was a "missing application" error for an app we had just installed or connectivity problems with a computer, the heavily customized software is experiencing some growing pains that you'll have to live with at first, until Meizu get them fixed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, December 30: We received the stock firmware image from Meizu and we re-ran the tests with the CPU clocked at 1.4GHz (it used to be 1.2GHz). We've left the old results in so you can see how much of a difference 200MHz make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi performance was already pretty good, but after the update the MX became one of the fastest droids in this test. It rivals both the Samsung Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Nexus, with the Galaxy S II following slightly behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something went wrong with Linpack and it started reporting very low results after the update. Considering pre-update the Meizu MX was doing 92.3 MFLOPS, we expected it to match the Galaxy Note post-update (both use the same chipset at the same clock speeds). We've had an issue like that with Linpack before (after we updated LG Optimus 2X).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mali-400MP GPU did very well at the graphics benchmark, almost matching the Galaxy S II, which has about 40% fewer pixels on its screen. Android games will run buttery smooth on the Meizu MX. The update changed nothing - it was only the CPU clock speed that was reduced, it turns out the GPU was running at the final speed all along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it came to browser benchmarks, the Meizu MX overtook the Samsung Galaxy S II in Sun Spider and ended up slightly behind the Galaxy Note. The updated JavaScript engine in the ICS-running Galaxy Nexus is the leader here due to some amazing optimizations for the new OS on Google's part. In BrowserMark (which tests both JavaScript and HTML5 performance), the Meizu MX almost caught up to the HTC Sensation XE, which is still the best Gingerbread droid in this particular test (with ICS having an impressive lead again).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook could use more SNS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Meizu MX is pretty basic. At its core is a list of all contacts but you can view only a specific group or filter where contracts come from - phone contacts, email account or a Meizu account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't add Facebook or Twitter or any social network out of the box. Installing the Facebook or Twitter app will allow you to sync your contacts from there. You can link contacts, but the functionality is annoyingly limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook will automatically link contacts with the same name, but that's it. You can't manually link or unlink contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact's info shows you all the available info and that's about it. We liked how phone numbers are listed though - the whole line is a button that will dial the number, but there's a message icon to the right to send a text message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is a part of the same app as the dialer and the call log, but there's a fourth tab that lets you search contacts (which is identical to the phonebook tab save for the search field on top). You can use the alphabet scroll too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX had no issues with signal reception and the in-call sound was good, though not very loud even at the loudest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer of the Meizu MX lacks smart dialing but it does have one interesting trick - dial a number and it will tell you the country (e.g. "United States" for a number starting with +1, "United Kingdom" for +44 and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call, the proximity sensor will lock the screen when you put the phone next to your ear. There's an option for the phone to vibrate when the call is connected, so you won't miss it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the first tab of the telephony app and it keeps a list of all your recent calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turned out that there is a way to set custom ringtones, but we missed it at first. You need to copy the ringtone you want to the special Ringtones folder, which will make it accessible in the Settings menu. You can't just use the music player like on most Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed our traditional loudspeaker test on the Meizu MX and it scored an Average mark. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is iOS like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, the input field starts out at only one line tall, but will grow to up to seven lines if need be. To the left of it is a smiley button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Batch operations are enabled for multiple threads - Mark as spam and Delete are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, there's the standard Gmail app available along with a generic email client. The Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. The top row holds two labels ? the first is the name of the inbox you?re currently viewing (tap it to change the inbox) and the one next to it is the name of the current folder (again, tap to change it). There's no combined inbox unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Batch operations are supported by the email client though - Mark, Filter and Delete are the available options. Filter acts against spam to weed out unwanted email addresses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text entry is handled by a custom keyboard with well-spaced keys. It's quite easy to use and the relatively big screen helps too. Weirdly, there's no landscape mode anywhere in the messaging department, so you'll rarely get to use the roomier landscape keyboard (it is available if the app supports landscape).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX packs a gallery that looks similar to the vanilla Android gallery, but it's actually a custom-made app. It stacks images from folders just like the regular app, but this is about where similarities end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the folders, images are arranged in a rectangular grid. You can share or delete multiple images by picking them one by one from a Cover flow-like interface or the usual way just picking them from the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a dedicated brightness setting and slideshow options. Zooming is done as usual by double tapping and pinching. Everything works smoothly thanks to the powerful chipset and the high-res screen does a good job, provided you don't look at it from an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool way to navigate across a folder while looking at individual images is to tap somewhere outside the image, which reveals a line of thumbnails at the bottom of the screen. You can tap thumbnails or even slide your finger over them - the Meizu MX will switch images as fast as you can slide your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX came with a very good file browser preinstalled. It lets you browse the contents of the built-in memory and offers features such as copy, paste and delete for multiple files. Sharing files over Bluetooth or email is also easy as are batch operations with multiple files and folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also handled opening and extracting ZIP files, which can come in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with excellent codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX comes with a dedicated Video app, but it expects videos to be placed in a certain folder. You can use the file browser to get videos to play from elsewhere - it offers thumbnails and everything so we used it all the time instead of the Video app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the player, things really start to look up. The player handled all the DivX, XviD and H.264 files we threw at it played trouble-free (in .AVI, .MKV and .MP4 containers) and resolution didn?t matter either - 1080p videos played without a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a lot of nice options - a dedicated brightness setting for the video player and zoom mode (fit width of the screen or fit height). You can also switch audio streams and turn on subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Too bad you can't load subtitles manually though. On the upside, the name of the subtitles file doesn?t have to be exactly the same as the video file for it to work (as is most often the case), the player will find all similar files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the MHL connectivity, the Meizu MX turns into a very capable video player. Even without it, at 4" big and with 960x640 resolution you can enjoy 720p videos comfortably - though the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen will require some cropping if you want to use all the pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the only thing we didn?t like about the video player is that the volume slider is placed right under the playback controls. It's an iOS thing and might be confusing to people who expect it to be a scrubber (you can do that too, that slider is on top).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player looks like it belongs in iOS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the video player, the music player can only find tracks located in a specific folder. You can open folders too, it just takes several extra clicks and you music collection isn't consolidated into one library as you would expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, tracks are sorted into several categories like Recently added, Favorites, by album (but not by artist) or you can just look at all songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the album art at the center with track info above it along with repeat and shuffle controls, and the playback controls and volume slider below the album art. Again, this is a volume slider, if you want to scrub through the song you need to tap above the album art to reveal that slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't have album art, the Meizu MX can search for one automatically or you can go to the equalizer visualization by swiping left. This visualization also does a karaoke-style display of the song's lyrics. A swipe to the right brings you to the current playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an equalizer you can use to tune the sound too. It features several presets, which you can edit manually if they're not to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget that you also get music player controls in the control panel invoked by the Menu key and also on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a shutdown timer which can turn it off in 5-60 minutes and it will even let you manually edit the ID3 tags (that's where artist, album and so on info is stored).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX went off to an impressive start in our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone got excellent scores and its performance showed no weak spots whatsoever. It was only average in loudness, but that wasn't enough to ruin an otherwise flawless performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, things weren't as good in the second part of our test. When we plugged in a pair of headphones, plenty of distortion appeared in the Meizu MX output. Both the total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion readings dropped to poor and so did stereo crosstalk. The other elements of the performance remained excellent and the volume was one of the highest we have seen, but the overall performance still remained pretty mediocre here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things, the Meizu MX has an 8 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 3264x2448 pixels and an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty decent, similar to the stock camera app. The three main controls are on the right side of the viewfinder ? from top to bottom, they are the still shot/video switch, the virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which shows the thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of the viewfinder are the front/back camera toggle and the flash mode setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the usual settings ? scenes, color effects, image adjustments but also a Wide Dynamic Range option. Photos can be geotagged and there's a smile detection option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the iPhone, you can use the Meizu's volume rocker to capture a photo. Unfortunately, neither that nor the virtual shutter can be pressed and held to autofocus, you have to rely on the continuous autofocus instead (and that gets it wrong sometimes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, it would refocus all the time, which got really annoying. Also, framing a shot turned out to be difficult to get right because of a discrepancy between what the viewfinder shows and how the gallery displays the captured image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is average for an 8MP shooter. The MX does well when it comes to noise suppression (it left only traces of color noise, but there was image grain) but the levels of fine detail are average at best. Colors are accurate but shadows are often underexposed. Overall the results are quite passable if you're not expecting excellence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that our sample had very prominent lens issues in the left part of the frame, plus some problems on the right edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a couple of photos in Wide Dynamic Range mode, here they are. The photos were taken with WDR set to off and set to high, respectively. What it does is lighten up the shadows and while it helps to even out lighting in high-contrast scenes, it also reveals the generally abundant noise in the shadows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's the Meizu MX in our Photo Compare Tool in the 8MP category. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the synthetic resolution chart, the Meizu MX does really well but that doesn?t translate into actual performance. The work of the noise reduction algorithms is easy to spot in the second chart - not the worst we've seen, but there have been others that spare more fine detail. The third chart is shot under artificial lighting on auto and shows a strong blue tint, which is something to keep in mind.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder uses the same interface as the still camera, except the bar to the right side is now transparent to make room for the 16:9 video. You can control the video light and pick scenes for the video before you start shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX captures videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps in MP4 files. The bitrate is around 8Mbps, which is much too low for FullHD videos, with AAC-encoded stereo sound (with 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality is far below the leaders in the field, with noticeable compression artifacts. The framerate of 30fps is achieved easily but the practical resolution is nowhere near 1080p. 720p mode doesn?t help the situation either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a 1080p and 720p video samples so you can see for yourself. Just don't forget to choose 1080p resolution and view them in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here's an untouched 1080p@30fps (11MB, 0:10s) video that comes straight from the phone without any re-encoding.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX is in our Video Compare Tool database. The third chart shows decent (but not great) synthetic resolution Compression artifacts are very noticeable in the blue background of our setup. With the lights off, most of the fine detail disappears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the setup shows that the Meizu MX shoots better videos of close subjects that distant ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Expansive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX does very well when it comes to travelling - it does quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE along with penta-band 3G with blazing fast HDPA+ - the downlink reaches up to 21.6Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locally, you get Wi-Fi b/g/n with WPS for easy and secure connections to new Wi-Fi routers. The Meizu MX uses Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, which is getting old but still gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi reception on the Meizu MX is very weak. It's not a death-grip issue, but if you move away from the router with some moderate obstacles in the way, the signal drops to the bottom threshold. It works most of the time, but it cuts out too. Other phones have little issues working in the same area. 2G/3G reception wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is quite interesting - it supports mass storage connections with a computer as you would expect, but also does USB host for hooking things to the phone, MHL for HD TV-Out and also S/PDIF, which is a digital way to output multi-channel audio and will be used for the dock.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Redesigned web browser is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser plays a central role in the Meizu MX as evidenced by its shortcut's position - the middle shortcut in the dock at the bottom of the homescreen, which is usually where the app drawer shortcut goes (or the dialer shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser has been completely redesigned and we found a couple of things we really liked about it. The back end is the same as on all Androids, so you can expect the same level of compatibility and speed you're used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser interface dedicates almost the entire screen to the web page, save for the status bar on top. To bring out more controls, you tap the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls include the standard stuff - address bar on top and several buttons at the bottom (reload, new tab, close tab, bookmarks and more). Above those controls is a line of thumbnails of all the tabs. You can switch tabs or close them from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the best tab management solution we've seen in an Android browser yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming. It's really fast and fluid too. There are also goodies like text reflow or sharing an URL over email or SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser came without Flash preinstalled, but we installed it manually from the Market and it worked. 720p YouTube videos played mostly fine (with some lagging occasionally), but we expected 1080p to be smooth, like on the Galaxy S II. It seems like a software issue rather than a chipset issue. At least Flash games played without a hitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android also supports HTML5 videos, which are the future of mobile video streaming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Hidden Office document viewer on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you look through the homescreens, you won't find a document viewer app but if you try to open an Office document from the file browser, one will appear. It supports .DOC, .XLS and .PPT (both Office 2003 and 2007 files) and PDFs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewer works very fast in both zooming and panning. It lacks functionality like searching inside the document though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can't edit files, but there's a paid upgrade that enables that option too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has all the basics, but no extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX features a calendar that supports multiple online accounts. It offers monthly, daily and agenda views and is pretty straightforward to work with. Creating a new event lets you set which calendar to store it in, along with multiple reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In an iOS-like twist, the icon for the calendar displays the current day of the month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we have the Alarm Clock app that will handle multiple alarms with custom repeat patterns, ringtones, snooze time and labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Notes app, which offers four different colors for the background of a note, which will be helpful if you want to organize them into several categories. There's a widget accompanying the Notes app, which displays the most recent notes and offers a quick shortcut for adding new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recorder app rounds off the organizer functionality of the phone. It offers the option to record calls, which some might find useful.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX comes with a GPS receiver, which took less than a minute to get satellite lock from a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks or the network positioning if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with Maps 5.1 out of the box but we easily updated it to 6.0.3, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings, two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, those features aren?t available everywhere. 3D buildings are available mostly in the biggest world cities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view is, as usual, a part of the standard package - it gives you a panoramic view of every bit of road in the covered areas. With the compass mode enabled, it feels like a virtual tour of the place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market and Meizu's Mstore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market has several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-app section is untouched by the recent redesign and we still find it quite unattractive. It offers useful info on the app, like rating and comments along with the info, screenshots and demo videos by the developers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on board the Meizu MX is the Mstore. It's an alternative app store run by Meizu with both free and paid apps and games. The content in there is targeted at the Chinese market, so it's a good place to look for apps if you speak the language, but otherwise you should stick to the regular Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX made some big promises when it entered the scene and it has delivered on several of them. But it also failed to fulfill others. Also, the pursuit of imitating the iPhone is a big negative in our opinion - it goes beyond borrowing ideas (which practically all makers are guilty of), it straight up copies a few pages. That puts it too deep in iClone territory for comfort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're some things about the MX that scream "Come on, Apple, sue me!" But Meizu seem beyond the point of looking for this kind of? erm? publicity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MX is well put together but it's made of some unflattering materials. The screen while of high resolution and pixel density leaves something to be desired when it comes to contrast and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also doesn?t quite live up to the standards set by the current 8MP leaders, but the situation-aware keys were pretty neat. Best of all we liked the Exynos chipset, which offers plenty of oomph and will get even better once Meizu finalizes the software that gets the best out of the processor at 1.4GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of software, there were some real advantages over vanilla Android but also steps back in a few instances. Still, it's a truly unique Android experience even if it is inspired by iOS in places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the Meizu MX is up there with the best of them. Still, if you're not willing to take a chance on an unproven manufacturer, you can go for the usual suspects like the Apple iPhone 4S, the Samsung Galaxy S II, the HTC Sensation XE or the Motorola RAZR XT910.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Apple iPhone 4S ? Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II ? HTC Sensation XE ? Motorola RAZR XT910</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of them aren't much pricier than the Meizu MX, so if you were looking for a cheaper dual-core deal you might want to check out the LG Optimus 2X or the Samsung I9103 Galaxy R.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or if getting the best Android experience is your main concern, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is a safer bet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus 2X ? Samsung I9103 Galaxy R ? Samsung Galaxy Nexus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're guessing the Meizu MX will find plenty of buyers in its home market. As for going international, we're not so sure. It's a solid phone no doubt, but it has flaws that could be deal-breakers to some. You'll have to deal with mocking comments too about it being an iPhone knockoff. The question is how many of those mocking are secretly a little jealous.</paragraph>
