			<paragraph>Windows Mobile wars are at their fiercest and a truce is nowhere in sight with new recruits marching to battle as we speak. HTC Touch Pro is adding some heavy firepower to the Touch Diamond campaign for domination of the WinMo realm. The new pro by HTC is a true all-rounder, with multimedia and navigation just part of its ammo, and has every premise of becoming the most complete Windows-powered device to date. Armed and dangerous it is, but will it get a license to kill?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having already seen this phone doesn't make us any less excited to take it out for a spin. Yes, you will hear us call the Diamond and the Touch Pro twins and there will be déj?-vu aplenty in this article. After all, it's the same platform and design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro is armed to the very last one of them QWERTY teeth, almost every worth having mobile phone feature on its list. So much so, that a viable alternative is hard to find on the current market. The arch enemy however is just a quick look ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 spec sheet is almost identical to the one of Touch Pro. In addition they run on the same Windows Mobile Professional 6.1 OS. Now, add the fact that it's HTC that actually manufactures the X1 super phone, and you've got quite a clone war shaping up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you aren't dying to have a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, the options are quite clear. The HTC Touch Diamond (the Touch Pro keyboardless and much slimmer twin) and the Samsung i900 Omnia have been around struggling for the upper hand over the past three months. You can check out our comparison article or the dedicated reviews of the Omnia and the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now take your time, we'll be back to the looks and feel of the HTC Touch Pro after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most notable thing about the HTC Touch Pro retail package is its shape. It's the same design as the Diamond's box: a reverse truncated pyramid. Made of glossy plastic, it's a high-end box of a high-end handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as contents are concerned, we've been there with the Diamond. We knew better than hope for a memory card inside. To put it mildly, HTC are letting everyone decide how big a card they need. As for those keen to accessorize their handset, HTC have launched a whole series of nice little extras for the Touch Pro that can be purchased separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of items that come with the Touch Pro isn't too long: there's a charger/USB cable combo, a pair of wired headphones, a spare stylus and a CD with software of arguable use. Much like with the Diamond, the headphones of the Touch Pro aren't quite our kind of stuff for the really low bass levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice surprise here is the leather carrying case for the Touch Pro. There is also a bunch of leaflets and guides, along with a catalog of available accessories to order. Finally, a screen protector is included to help protect your precious handset from scratches (which are inflicted rather easily). We would definitely recommend using it, we still can't get over the scratches we inflicted on the Diamond screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Pro 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro measures 102 x 51 x 18.1 mm, which is hefty by almost any standard. It sure isn't Nokia-E90-huge but still is among the big ones out there. Nevertheless, the Touch Pro is a nicely sized device for its class, and an ergonomic feat compared to HTC TyTN II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 165 g just can't be overlooked - do not expect to just slip the Pro in you pocket and forget it's there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro is one diamond of a looker. The gem-inspired back panel is here of course but it's less pronounced and the glossy plastic is now replaced by mat rubbery finish. This way the handset is more practical: it provides for a better grip, it'won't bruise along the edges as easily as the Diamond and finally, it doesn't attract fingerprints that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, it's quite obvious that in reality the Touch Pro is darker than the Touch Diamond. It's closer to the pitch black color of the HTC promo shots. The somewhat cheap looking bluish grey color of the front in certain light conditions is now far less prominent. The difference can be easily noticed on those comparative photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side, the usual problem with glossy panels stands with the Touch Pro too - fingerprints do make a mess of it. At least the back panel is now impossible to get covered with smudges, which is a welcome improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is dominated by the 2.8" screen of the superb VGA resolution. While not exactly a novelty among PocketPCs, the VGA screen is really one of the highlights of the newest HTC devices. We'll be back to the display a little later trying to see if VGA can show its full potential on a screen of this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the secondary videocall camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front panel is taken by the four hardware controls and the special scroll wheel/D-pad combo. The regular keys do not have the best tactility we have experienced, which ruins some of the user experience with the Touch Pro. After all, you wouldn't expect this kind of compromises in a company flagship, much less with something as trivial as this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, HTC do deserve credit for finding room for a back key on the Touch Pro. It gets you one screen back wherever you are in the interface and though this might seem the simplest of things, it is missing in other WinMo devices. In the Touch Pro and the Touch Diamond, it's a real boost to user-friendliness and handling is a step closer to a regular phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is a bit of a letdown. It combines the regular 5-way functionality with a touch sensitive overlay to use as a scroll wheell. The touch-sensitive scroll wheel can be used for zooming on images, web pages, messages, and doubles as music controls. It basically is the same as the HTC Touch Cruise scroll wheel, only in touch disguise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, pressing the D-pad rather frequently results in accidental presses on some of the other keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the Diamond there is only the power key, which is also used for toggling the standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no controls to be seen on the right side of HTC Touch Pro. A dedicated shutter key would've been welcome. Instead, the HTC R&amp;D team chose to leave that to the D-pad. The dual focus-and-shoot action is all there: a tap on the touch-sensitive D-pad counts as half-press, while pushing the confirming center all the way down is a full press. Not the most comfortable solution but it does the job alright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Diamond we find the volume rocker, which is large enough and comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the miniUSB port for connecting the data cable, charger and the headphones. The other thing to note here is the stylus compartment, which scores another point for the Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're tucking the stylus back in, you don't need to push all the way down. The slot is magnetic and it literally pulls the stylus in. Furthermore, the stylus is active, so when you take it out, the phone automatically wakes up. In addition, taking out the stylus during a call automatically activates the Notes applications, so you can quickly put down a phone number for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the HTC Touch Pro retains the gem-inspired pattern of the Diamond but the facet edges are less prominent. Adding the rubber finish, the Touch Pro is much more stable when laid on its back on an even surface. The quick wearing down of the edges we saw with the Diamond also seems unlikely with the Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as functional elements are concerned, the HTC Touch Pro features a 3 megapixel camera and a LED flash on its rear. The flash isn't the most powerful around, so shooting in low light conditions is still pretty much out of the question but it is better than nothing - which is exactly what the Diamond had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice surprise is that the camera of the Touch Pro, unlike the one of the Diamond, hasn't got a layer of plastic over it. The Diamond image quality suffered and we are glad the Touch Pro approach is different. An out-and-out description of the performance of the camera will follow towards the end of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 1340 mAh Li-ion battery that powers the HTC Touch Pro. Powerful as it may sound, you shouldn't expect miracles from the battery. The VGA screen is really power hungry and the Touch Pro has quite a lot of other energy-consuming features. Still, the Touch Pro will give you slightly less than two days of really hard use, which sounds decent in our point of view. It's better than the Diamond by just as much as one might expect (given the capacity difference: 1340 mAh in Touch Pro against 900 mAh in Touch Diamond).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also managed about five days of stand-by in a 3G network when barely used. Still we doubt that this will be the case with any Touch Pro user - a phone like that is meant to be used and abused.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest under the battery cover is the microSD card slot. It has no problem handling cards with a capacity of 8GB, which is the largest currently available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the build quality of the HTC Touch Pro makes a decent impression. It looks well sturdier than the Diamond though we still have our doubts about its long term durability. It's rather pleasant to look at, except the fingerprint prone front. It's got good ergonomics but the thick size doesn't make it the easiest to handle. You can't have it all we guess - this is the price to pay for the QWERTY keypad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display - for 307,200 reasons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro flaunts a 2.8" 65K-color screen of VGA resolution. Thanks to the unmatched pixel-to-inch ratio, the Touch Pro has truly great picture quality. Here's the quick math: HTC TyTN II has the same sized screen, featuring only a quarter of the Touch Pro's (or Diamond's for that matter) pixels - where there are exactly 307,200 of them. This makes the new HTC releases one of the best WinMo devices in terms of picture quality. Those are even comparable to some of the best displays on the market, which was hard to imagine not so long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many would make a case of the Pro's 65K-color support "only". But hey, there aren't really that many cases when the difference between 65K and 16M colors is visible to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the problem with the sunlight legibility still stands. The HTC Touch Pro by far isn't the best device to have with you in the bright sun. There is a slight improvement over the TyTN II but the result is still far from impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another potential problem with the Touch Pro (judging by our Diamond experience) is the display's proneness to scratches. As already mentioned, you can get around this by using the screen protector.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keyboard - five rows of texting bliss<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard slides out from the left side. The sliding mechanism itself isn't the best around, a rustling metallic sound produced every time it locks in an open position. Upon opening the keypad the screen automatically rotates to landscape orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is brilliant, with great ergonomics. The five-row layout is a great help here and the keys are still big enough to handle comfortably. The press is solid and touch orientation is quite good so, in general, there is little reason to complain about the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typing experience is second to Nokia E90 only but it's mainly because size does matter here and the Nokia monster has plenty of that. So, unless you don't care what your handset does to your pocket, the HTC Touch Pro is probably your best choice for a QWERTY device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is strong and even enough with little reasons to moan about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Pro vs HTC Touch Diamond<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track, by this point you would probably have noticed that the HTC Touch Pro and the HTC Touch Diamond are pretty much the same. In fact, the differences boil down to the hardware, so this might be a good time to sum them up. Here is a quick list of why one might pick any of the HTC gadgets over the other.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Diamond over Pro<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pro over Diamond<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as software is concerned, the HTC Touch Pro and the HTC Touch Diamond are virtually identical in terms of their latest ROMs, though there's notable evolution from the very first Diamond firmware. There are now less fly-out effects throughout the TouchFLO menu but the responsiveness and speed have been greatly improved. Some users may prefer the eye-candy of the previous ROMs to the speed of the newer ones, so it's a matter of priorities we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few Touch Pro goodies that aren't shared between the devices by default have been kindly unlocked by third-party solutions in the Diamond, so there is nothing in the software to make you favor one over the other. This means that if you have been keeping track of our recent reviews, the software part might seem rather familiar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchFLO<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You don't have to be a hardcore WinMo geek to be familiar by now with the previous implementations of the TouchFLO UI - we saw them in the HTC Touch and the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the HTC Touch it was a launcher application in the form of a cube, controlled via finger sweeps. To that the HTC Touch Cruise added finger scrolling in applications such as Contacts, Messaging, and Internet Explorer Mobile. Users can also enjoy some fancy image flipping and zooming in the custom image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, HTC Touch Pro brings all that a level up - meet the TouchFLO 3D. It does offer those same things as the HTC Touch Cruise, adding however some extra cool looking Home screen that is as touch-optimized as it gets in the WinMo realm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just so you know, for this review we are running our Touch Pro on the latest ROM version available: 1.90.401.1. It's a standard ROM with no system tweaks applied. We have to note that we do find the TouchFLO 3D on this newer ROM faster than on the previous ones. The TouchFLO 3D is pretty responsive once you learn the various ways to control it and it only lags when for some reason you switch to the underlying Windows interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting started - the home screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D Home screen consists of several full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the tab thumbnails at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need. The list is long and includes the home screen (with a large clock), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, photos and video, music, weather, settings and a customizable application launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the official HTC TouchFLO 3D demo isn't very indicative to changes the latest ROM brings, here is quick video walkthrough showing what the current performance of the Touch Pro is like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's have a closer look at those tabs. A nice thing is that each tab comes with its own set of context keys. This means that with the TouchFLO 3D at hand, you would rarely need to use the Windows built-in interface (except for file browsing and setting the alarm). On the negative side the context keys aren't customizable to suit your needs on any of the tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than showing the clock, the Home tab gives you access to the HTC Call log, Windows World clock, Windows Alarm application, windows calendar application - in case you have pending events for the day, they too get listed here. The context keys give you access to the Phone Pad and the TouchFLO Programs tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the second TouchFLO tab called People, you can set favorite contacts, which would be displayed with their assigned images or, in case you haven't set those, a generic image. You can scroll images with a finger sweep. A tap on the photo will take you to the contact's details, while a tap on the number below the image will automatically dial it. You can scroll the favorite contacts by using the thumbnail bar on the right too. The context keys give you access to the regular Windows Mobile contact list or several settings for managing favorite contacts, such as remove or change picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab shows your latest SMS/MMS. A single finger sweep displays the next message. A small shortcut in the top right corner will automatically start a new SMS/MMS with the default Windows message editor. The context keys will give you access to the Windows Mobile SMS/MMS inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email tab shows your emails in an attractive way and, again, you can flip through them one by one. Flipping them however is hard as more than often it happens that you open an email instead of flipping it over. So all in all, the email tab is rather redundant - except for changing email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dedicated shortcut starts the editor for composing new email. The context keys take you to the Windows Mobile Email inbox, and handle several commands such as Send/Receive or Email Account management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet tab launches the Opera 9.5 web browser or the slick preinstalled YouTube video client. You can also scroll your bookmarks and launch one directly from there. The first context key displays all of your bookmarks but this time within the browser, while the second one? starts the browser. HTC must have lost their focus setting up this tab. A shortcut to the preinstalled RSS reader and streaming media player would have been much nicer. There's no option either for changing the default Opera browser and there's no way to type a URL directly on the Home screen and open it in the browser. Those are exactly the same issues we identified in the Diamond and, no, we didn't expect them addressed in the Touch Pro. We just feel they're worth pointing out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most useful tabs is in charge of the Photos and Videos . You can scroll them with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here. It's pretty much the easiest way to do it, as there is no dedicated camera key. The context keys launch the Album application, which is used for viewing all your images and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab displays albums with their covers and you can flip through them much like you would on the iPhone and its gorgeous Cover Flow. The context keys let you access the music player options and the music player library where you can sort your music based on other filters beside album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab is self explanatory but it easily amazes with graphics. You can check the weather in several locations and you can alternate them with a finger sweep. You can also get a 5-day forecast for these locations via the first context key. The second context key allows you to manage the locations, for which the weather will be monitored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Settings and it lets you control various system options saving you the effort of using the confusing Windows Mobile Settings page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, you can set the ringing profile, volume level and ringtone all from one central place. Now, that's really handy. Even pressing the volume rocker brings up a fancy custom-made fullscreen slider instead the usual WinMo mini sliders. The original Windows Mobile sound settings are accessible from here too and are listed under Advanced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have access to the HTC custom Communications manager, which handles all on-board transceivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have added the so-called System status screen, which pops up when you touch the icons on the top of the Home screen. Those status icons are usually too tiny to press accurately with a finger and you would normally need the stylus to check battery status (by touching the battery indicator), regulate volume (by touching the speaker icon), or open the communications manager or phone and connectivity settings (by touching the signal indicator or network type icon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the System status screen, once you touch the area of those icons with your finger, all of them get listed fullscreen so you can easily pick the one you want. It's an extra step but it's nice nevertheless!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last tab is the customizable Application launcher where you can set shortcuts to the most frequently used features. Using the context keys you can also open a finger-scrollable list of all programs currently installed on your device. The list is dynamic, so as soon as you add new apps, it gets updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the alternative home screen the Touch Pro has to offer. It is only revealed when you slide the keyboard out in stand-by and offers a set of 8 shortcuts. Those include email, messages, bookmarks, web search, calendar, tasks, notes and contacts. The soft keys give access to the phone and call history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that pretty much gets all of them covered. We guess, it's been a long reading and that alone should hint you that the number of tabs is a bit too much. Some of them are totally redundant, such as the Internet tab, while others have some limitation imposed, which renders them useless (like the number of contacts in the People tab). There are people that don't use email on their mobile too, so basically our biggest grudge against the TouchFLO 3D interface is that you can't select which tabs get shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that thanks to a third-party software solution, you can re-order and, if necessary, hide some of the Home screen tabs. But there'll be more on it in the dedicated Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows beneath<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get past the Home screen and all the finger sweeps and animations though, all you are left with is muddy waters of the not-so-thumbable Microsoft OS. We are not against Windows Mobile by any means, however having to poke about your device with a little stick called stylus is so 1990s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC however have made some efforts to tweak up the core Windows usability too. Some of the most used system settings, contacts management, and the messaging department have all benefited, and so have image and web browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contact management clicks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contact list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. However, the small font and tiny fields make the stylus a must when you are searching a contact or editing its details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC offer the default WinMo contacts list, however they have added thumb scrolling courtesy of TouchFLO (a short sweep scrolls them gradually, while a fast single sweep scrolls the whole list from top to bottom). Secondly, you can pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right. Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact you have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance those are not enough - you can always rename some of the existing ones and use them instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the long list of available fields, when viewing a contact's details only those that are actually filled show up. A really nice feature is the Last call details that appear alongside every contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is the job of every cell phone and - believe it or not - smart devices such as the HTC Touch Pro do get a lot of that too. The Phone application offers smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you lift the Pro up to your ear, the display automatically switches off to avoid accidental presses. To do so, it doesn't rely on a proximity sensor like the iPhone, but uses the embedded light sensor instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside to that is you need to press the On/Off key to turn the display back on during the call. But once you do, it stays on until you've finished your conversation. If however you don't like that solution, you are welcome to check out the Tweaks &amp; Modding section of this review for a quick remedy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC Touch Pro an extra cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself. It's quite unlikely to get your calls accidentally muted in your pocket - the feature is so set up that it's more likely to not engage at all, rather than engage for no reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that if the Pro is already face down when a call comes in, the feature won't be available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro boasts another couple of user-friendly features that make call management even better. First of all, pulling out the active stylus during a call will automatically turn the display on and launch the Notes application. It even puts down the call details (the other party name and the time of call) on the note for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And secondly, the HTC Pro comes with a feature that's available on many feature phones - reject call with SMS. When you reject a call, the handset automatically sends the rejected caller a preset text message. We've never found that particularly useful, since you may have a dozen of different reasons to reject a call and there's hardly a universal message text that can cater to them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with the HTC Touch Pro, the SMS is not sent automatically. Instead you are prompted to review and possibly edit the template before dispatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. HTC have perked up the looks of the regular WinMo calls log and have added thumb scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we conducted our traditional speakerphone test to conclude the phone part of the Pro review. You aren't likely to miss too many calls with it, as it's scored a Good mark, ranking well above the average. Here's how the HTC Touch Pro ranks along several other smart devices. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor. Thanks to TouchFLO you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and longer messages. Dynamic font resizing (zooming in/out with the scroll wheel) is also at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of Windows 6.1, users enjoy threaded SMS, so you can be sure you get that feature on the Touch Pro. Also, contrary to what some users report, the HTC Touch Pro DOES offer Message delivery reports in its Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly debated feature of the Touch Pro concerns receiving SMS in standby mode. When a message comes in, the handset only produces a tone with no vibration. The SMS alert doesn't wake the device up either - it stays in standby mode. We find that a perfectly usable solution and we don't object at all. Furthermore, the scroll wheel backlight blinks at regular intervals to alert you of an unread message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox holds no surprises to experienced WinMo users. A nice upgrade is the dynamic zooming with the scroll wheel, which is available when you are reading an email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the Touch Pro. In addition to the perfect hardware QWERTY keyboard, HTC have equipped the device with a set of home-grown thumbable virtual keyboards. It's a commendable feature since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are outdated and uncomfortable, to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first software keyboard is full QWERTY, the second one is Sony Ericsson P1-style QW-ER-TY and, finally, the third one is a regular 9-key multi-tap keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open the slider causing the screen to rotate to landscape mode, you also get larger landscape versions of those keyboards. However we can't quite see the need of them in this mode with the hardware keys at your disposal. Unfortunately, the rotation without opening the keyboard isn't normally available. It's strange that HTC haven't taken care of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, thanks again to third-party app developers, users now have more control over the screen rotation feature and that has made landscape typing possible. You can read more about it in the dedicated Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia management and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro doesn't offer the generous amount of internal storage of the Diamond but thanks to the built-in card slot you can reach much greater heights. In addition, the existence of a card slot makes running software that ships on a memory card trouble-free. This is the case with most GPS navigation applications for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the read/write performance of the Touch Pro both against software benchmarks and in real life tasks. Both tests gave similar results so we are publishing only the real-life one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We concluded our real-life test on a Windows XP-based PC paired with the Pro in USB Mass Storage mode. Overall, it showed really nice results in the Read operation (copying from handset to PC). However the Write operation was three times slower. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro copy/paste performance to an inserted memory card:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you should bear in mind that those figures will be lower on a Vista-based PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously those results are almost exactly the same as the ones we achieved with the Touch Diamond and its built-in memory. Since the Diamond's built-in memory is no faster than the Touch Pro operating with a memory card, we can't really understand why HTC didn't equip the Diamond with a card slot instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro offers a nice thumbnail browser straight from the Photos and Videos tab on the Home screen. There's another thumbnail browser in the Album app available from the context menu on the Home screen or the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the image is opened, you can make use of the auto screen rotation feature to view it in landscape mode or you can zoom with a circular gesture on the display (it's TouchFLO, baby) or on the scroll wheel. Once you zoom in on the image you can start panning by dragging your thumb, or you can use the D-pad. The Albums application also offers a customizable slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling to the next image is a matter of a single finger sweep and it's almost instantaneous. The image viewer actually has the same functionality as in the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, switching to landscape mode is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got to be said that the Touch Pro has a certain advantage over competing devices when it comes to image browsing since this is one of the applications where VGA does count big time. The images look great on the high resolution screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player iPod style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro has a good music player, which makes heavy use of album art. The music player is accessible straight from the TouchFLO home screen with a cool iPhone-like cover flow animation for you to pick an album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other criteria beside album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and stunningly reminiscent of iPhone's very own music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no 3.5mm audio jack on the Pro or on its headphones, so unless you get hold of a third-party adapter, you're stuck with the supplied headset, which - simply put - sucks. The headset does look good, but listening to music is not among its strengths - it's best left for making phone calls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You'd hardly ever hear us praise Windows Mobile devices for their audio quality. Most have so far got away with way below-par audio output thanks to their business mindset. However, with passable results of the Diamond in mind we did hope the Touch Pro won't be a disappointment either. It did bring a nice surprise, surpassing the Diamond in almost every single reading. The differences aren't huge but they are still a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems though that HTC have put some sort of a high-pass filter in the Touch Pro, hence the frequency response graph you can see posted below. Compared to the Diamond, the Touch Pro is closer to the real thing but still far from the best.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's an FM radio, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pro's built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in. As we already told you however, you would be better off using a third-party headset with some sort of 3.5mm audio adapter, as the original set is not well suited for listening to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the Touch Pro FM radio has an excellent interface much like the rest of the multimedia players on board and offers memory for some 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is available too - so overall, it's a nice job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Portable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro has a nice video player but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to Winodws. To enjoy a more versatile video support on the Pro (DiVX or XViD for example), you will probably need to purchase a dedicated video player, which has support for more file types than the stock variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We resorted to the well-known Core player, since the free TCPMP player didn't run on the handset, probably due to some compatibility issues with Windows Mobile 6.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Pro is pretty good at near VGA-res XviD video playback - we played an XviD encoded DVD rip for PC playback and, luckily, there were no skipped frames. Credit probably goes to the dedicated graphics chip. We are glad that HTC have finally sorted the video performance issues that plagued their previous generation of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro VGA display did count here: the video looked excellent, well ahead of other devices. We guess the Pro is a sealed deal for movie aficionados.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera is a step ahead too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. It offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It lacks a dedicated camera key so, in order to pre-focus before you snap a picture with the Pro, you simply tap the touch-sensitive D-pad. Once focus is locked, you can take the picture by pressing the confirm button of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro camera packs a LED flash, but having in mind its power it isn't making that much of a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interface and features </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro viewfinder is free of any overlaying controls by default but you can display those by touching the display once, while in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC Touch Pro is regularly equipped and offers the standard self-timer, white balance presets, as well as color effects, and a viewfinder gridline. You can shoot images with the front-facing video-call camera too and there's some nice custom resolution setting for contacts' images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest letdown, when it comes to features, is that the camera lacks geotagging. Why that's left out is beyond us. Nevertheless, we have found a free third-party fix for that, but we'll discuss it in the Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Touch Pro you can shoot macro images easily without changing modes or anything. However focusing in close-ups is rather hard and is more of a hit-or-miss - sometimes the Touch Pro focuses correctly, while other times it's way off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a panorama mode that offers on-screen framing guidance. After all the individual shots for the panorama are taken, the Pro stitches the images automatically. The downside here is that in Panorama mode each individual image is shot at roughly 480 x 480 pixels. Plus, images are badly stitched. Obviously the Panorama mode is only ok if you intend to show your images on the handset display exclusively (which is exactly 480 pixels wide) with no further zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the HTC Touch Pro doesn't have the fishy layer of plastic over its camera lens like the Diamond. That's the right thing to do for HTC and picture quality has improved quite notably. Contrast and the resolved detail are also at a decent level and, as a whole, the performance is above average for a 3MP shooter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out some more photo samples from the Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro video capturing capabilities are not impressive by any means. All you get is CIF recording (352 x 288 pixel) at 30fps in MPEG4 format. It's not that bad: after all the VideoCD standard uses that resolution, but it's nowhere near what you would expect in a high-end smart device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles that of the still camera. You can only adjust white balance, the resolution and brightness and finally add some color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro offers excellent connectivity options - HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi and stereo Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR are all on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro has quad-band GSM and dual-band HSDPA support, however it will have two localized versions to cover markets world-wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 support is also present of course and every time you plug in the USB cable the Touch Pro prompts selecting between ActiveSync and USB Mass Storage connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Touch Pro packs a memory card slot, which proves quite comfortable for quickly transferring large amounts of data to or from it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro is equipped with the latest version of the Opera browser, which makes the Internet Explorer Mobile redundant. The Opera 9.5 browser is extensively touch-optimized and seems heavily inspired by the iPhone Safari browser. However, it's such a new piece of software that the public beta has only been available for a few weeks and the release version seems far ahead. That alone should tell you that the web browser is in for some early development bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VGA display snatches a point again in the web browsing department. When the browser loads the full website preview, the minute text still remains recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it fails to deliver the same level of usability as the Safari browser, the Opera 9.5 makes up for it by throwing in a few features that totally lack on the iPhone, such as text copy/paste, Flash support (Flash Lite 3 on the Touch Pro) and a download manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, when you zoom in the browser wraps the text, so the content fits the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a few words about the Opera 9.5 interface. By default web pages are opened fullscreen free of any overlaying controls. A tap on the bottom right corner however brings up the available controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher, the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one drawback we've noticed on the Pro implementation and the reason probably lies in the early development stage of the Opera 9.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here it goes - at times trying to pan a web page makes the web browser just zoom in or out without any logical reason. That behavior can be a real bugger and we hope they fix it in some of the next software updates. With time this can get really annoying and some users end up downloading the Opera Mini instead, which is proved to perform much better on the Diamond.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are a breeze to synchronize with MS Outlook. As of Windows Mobile 6.0, the Calendar allows browsing the events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. You can also hide weekends from the Calendar if you use it for business strictly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder and Calculator go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the little customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your office in your hand<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of the Office Mobile, you also get the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the VGA display of the Touch Pro proves superior in fitting documents contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the Pro in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search software, capable of searching throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro comes loaded with additional third-party software to meet various Windows Mobile user needs. It's got the regular stuff like RSS Reader and Streaming Media manager, but it has some really original applications to go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's nice of HTC to have preinstalled a Task Manager on the Touch Pro. Unfortunately, it's only available via the TouchFLO homescreen interface upon a tap on the top right corner. We would have liked it better if the Task Manager was available across the Windows Mobile interface too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSSHub app is an RSS reader for staying abreast of the latest news and content at your favorite web places. The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro also ships with the MP3 Trimmer app. It allows you to crop MP3 tracks to make your own ringtones. Another goodie is the Remote Desktop Mobile client. It allows you to connect remotely to any Windows-based computer. It's a really handy feature that - if you ask us - should come preinstalled on all PocketPCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the Touch Pro impresses with the amusing Teeter game, which puts the built-in accelerometer to good use. Navigating a ball around a maze of holes became a favorite pastime among our team. Teeter easily impresses with its polished graphics and the handset even produces well-balanced vibrations each time your ball hits the walls of the maze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have also included an excellent YouTube client, which offers a fluid and great looking interface - even better than the one on iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we come upon an application which we didn't find in the Touch Diamond. It allows the user to calibrate its accelerometer by placing the Touch Pro on an even surface. We are guessing that due to the uneven back such a thing was impossible in the Diamond.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro features a built-in GPS receiver - it's the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, which comes along with the Qualcomm 7200A platform. It's the same chipset used in earlier HTC models such as the HTC TyTN II and the HTC Touch Cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro doesn't have a GPS navigation application pre-installed, so you have to purchase one separately. With a dedicated GPS app installed, it performed admirably as an in-car navigation unit. When it comes to displaying maps on screen, the Touch Pro's VGA display is a clear advantage. It offers much more detail than the iPhone for example at relatively the same level of magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick head-to-head using the free Google Maps for Mobile app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are pretty happy with the GPS sensitivity of the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, the same doesn't go to its energy efficiency. The competing SiRF Star III chipset is much better at that. Coupled with the high-res display, the Pro can't simply offer as much power autonomy with the GPS switched on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks and modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this is where a WinMo device review gets really exciting. After all, if there is one great thing about Windows OS, it's that it allows vast customization and all you need is a PC to pair with. While some of the tweaks are so logical you can't help but wonder why Microsoft or HTC didn't get them done in the first place, there is also quite some fun in boosting your own device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out, most of the applications that were verified to run on the Diamond are now available for the Touch Pro too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gsen app for the Touch Pro makes automatic screen rotation available almost all across the interface - except for the Home screen. An added bonus is that turning the handset face down on a flat surface automatically switches it to standby. However, it has compatibility issues with some of the ROM versions of the Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most valuable application is the TF3D Config app that allows you to tweak the Home screen tabs - you can hide the unneeded ones or freely re-arrange the current setup. It works nice and deals with our biggest grudge against the TouchFLO 3D Home screen - lack of customizability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, it now allows changing the theme of your home screen, redrawing every single one of its tabs. That functionality wasn't available at the beginning but it sure is a welcome addition now. There is already dozens of themes available, thanks to all the enthusiasts out there, so if you are bored with the same home screen over and over again - give it a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge list of system registry tweaks is also there for you. No matter if you want to turn on geo-tagging or unlock some hidden camera modes - all it takes is modifying a few registry settings here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft key functions on the Home tab can be altered too. The TouchFLO scroll speed is also adjustable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find a really helpful source of information and downloads here. Most of the just-described applications are covered, plus dozens more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the end of this review, we're back where we left off. The Touch Pro and the Diamond just go together. In the face of Touch Pro, the Diamond has lost some of its one-of-a-kind design-driven edge and gained elsewhere (beside the waistline). It's not the most obvious QWERTY add-on only: the TV-out port, better battery and microSD card slot sound just as sweet. It's not as simple as "we liked the Diamond, so we like the Touch Pro even better". It just so seems the Touch Pro comes closer to the definitive PocketPC concept.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it's time to draw the line and, from what our experience shows, the Touch Pro quite deserves every penny you spend on it. The price tag is hefty but it's worth noting that HTC Touch Pro costs less than the TyTN II used to upon release. There is no better device on the market in this class (yet) and if this is the kind of phone you are after - just go for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news for all the rest is that there's choice. The HTC Touch Diamond and the Samsung Omnia make pretty good keyboard-less alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say, the Touch Pro is still to receive its trial by fire. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 will also have its say on the market success of the Pro. Now, that's good news for all of us: an exciting clash awaits.</paragraph>
