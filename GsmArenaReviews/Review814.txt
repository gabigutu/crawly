			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy series has been showing no signs of slowing down and Samsung's shift into the limelight of modern technology can in large part be attributed to the emergence of the world's most successful smartphone line. A winning combination of R&amp;D, production, and marketing, the S5 and its predecessors have become a measure for an entire industry to go by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They say that excellence is contagious, and that's exactly where the LG G3 comes in. Crosstown rivals recently unleashed the G3 a whole two months after the S5, but did so with quite a splash. The G3 is the first device from a major manufacturer to sport a QHD screen, and it immediately ups the ante by rewarding those of us patient enough to wait until the second half of 2014 with a future-proof and robust competitor that can stand its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>They say the greatest minds in history were spurred on by their most competent rivals, and that couldn't be truer than in the case of these two tech giants. Let's see if the G3 has enough to make up for lost time; below are the key features that set each apart. Keep in mind those differences are on paper only and the advantage might shift from one side to the other in the actual tests that we are about to undertake.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy S5 over G3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Korean ingenuity has resulted in features we never imagined we'd see on a portable device - from heart rate sensors and fingerprint scanning to compact screens with resolutions greater than our TV at home. Smartphones have become the pinnacle of technology, an industry that sells in the millions and continues to grow each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we'll be pitting the top devices by two Korean companies at different stages of success - one at the head of the pack with no chance of slowing down; the other clawing its way up, trying to make its mark without necessarily emulating someone else's. Does the G3 have enough to put LG in the fast lane, or will the Galaxy S5 prove too hard to dethrone? Let's find out.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our shootouts have so far put the S5 at a disadvantage in the looks department - on certain occasions it was the extra hardware goodies and IP certification helping it salvage a hard-fought tie. Truth be told, polycarbonate construction is by its nature inferior to the glass/ceramic/glass unibodies of some of its competitors. This time around, though, there is a more level playing field, as the LG G3 is also made entirely out of plastic as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's design is essentially a unibody-like construction, which resembles the all-metal construction of the HTC One (M8), all the way down to the rounded rear panel. The faux brushed aluminum finish also lends to this illusion, while the back panel fits snugly on the device yet is easy to remove.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's design for the Galaxy S5 calls for a Gorilla Glass front, faux perforated leather on the back and a glossy plastic frame along the sides. The back is not everyone's cup of tea, but it hides fingerprints and scratches better and it's got more grip. Plus, it's a notable improvement over the last Galaxy S generation, for what it's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While looks are certainly a key feature of a smartphone (it's always in your hand or on ear), there are more things to consider before declaring a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the Galaxy S5 is more compact and lighter. The exact measurements are 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm and 145g for the Samsung. The G3 measures 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9mm and weighs 149g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arguably the most important measurement here is width where both phones are fairly close, but the extra 2mm surprisingly feel like much more, and the G3 definitely feels bigger if you hold the one after the other. Oddly, in terms of usability the larger screen diagonal actually play against the G3, as your thumb has even farther to travel in one-handed operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has IP67 dust and water certification, while the LG G3 does not. In case you're not familiar with IP ratings, the first digit is dust protection and the second is water resistance. A 6, as in the case of the S5, means no dust can get in at all. As for the second digit, a 7 indicates the Galaxy S5 can be submerged up to a meter of water for half an hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While having an IP certification is clearly an advantage for the S5, LG has made some compelling arguments against it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their primary skepticism is that quality standards set by the IP board are not clear from a user's point of view. For example, what happens when a device rated for 30 mins of water resistance is submerged for 29 minutes, taken out, then immediately submerged again? Does a new 30 minute period begin, or do you really only have one minute left? How long after submerging does this period reset? Submersability is a moot point, which is hard to grasp for the regular users and it has resulted in many drowned portables of various makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also argues that the force of the water jets you may expose the device to is also not specified. Certainly, you're talking about vastly different needs if you're trying to build a device to withstand a small splash of water or one to withstand a high-pressure jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both of these arguments are valid points from LG, but we still would have liked to see some sort of official protection from the elements - after all, we're not talking about a small investment here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the G2, LG has moved its physical buttons from below the screen to the display itself, while the power/lock and volume rocker are located below the camera lens on the back as part of the company's proprietary control deck. It's been refined since its initial implementation and both the volume rocker and power/lock button feature pleasant textures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung takes the more conventional approach of placing its physical buttons on both sides of the device, and retaining its hardware home button below the screen. The buttons are of ample firmness and are positioned relatively high to be reachable by thumb or index finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware Home key is a necessity on the Galaxy S5 since it houses a fingerprint sensor, the functions of which we'll cover in the software section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a microUSB 3.0 port (more on that later), which is covered by a protective flap for the sake of water resistance. Day to day it proves to be more of a nuisance, though, as you have to open and close it each time you charge the phone or connect it to a PC. LG's offering is neither protected, nor of the USB 3.0 flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices feature speakers located on the back, rather that front-facing ones like on some of their competitors. The Galaxy S5 has a small nub to keep the speaker from getting completely muffled by the surface it's resting on, while the G3's curved rear panel accomplishes the same task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera lens on the Samsung is the second element on the back that protrudes, causing some wobble. The 13MP shooter on the G3 is flush with the back, even slightly depressed to prevent scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the camera on the Galaxy S5 is another element we'll leave for later, the heart rate monitor. The G3's control deck feature below its camera is something we've covered above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panels of both devices are removable, revealing user-replaceable batteries underneath. Both rear panels are fairly easy to remove using the dedicated thumb crevice on the side. The LG G3 houses a 3,000mAh unit, while the Galaxy S5 runs on a 2,800mAh pack.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going into this shootout, you'd expect that it's pretty clear which of the two devices will have a distinct advantage when it comes to display fidelity. But before we go declaring the winner outright, let's keep in mind that there's more to a screen than the number of pixels it has. Contrast, colors, and sunlight legibility all factor into how good a particular display is, and we'll be taking everything into account before we give a final verdict.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones represent each company's screen-making expertise. Samsung put their Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy S5, while the LG G3 sports a True HD-IPS + LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1" screen of 1080p resolution and 432ppi. The G3's panel is of 1440 x 2560px resolution, which at 5.5" comes out to a pixel density of about 534ppi. Looking at them both under our microscope under the same magnification, you can clearly see which one is which.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung took several years to perfect Super AMOLED for it to finally offer the most accurate colors in the market. Using the display mode settings you can tweak that to a more saturated look if you prefer. It has excellent viewing angles and practically infinite contrast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G3 is another story, however, as it's markedly worse both at 50% and 100% brightness. At 100% brightness the black luminance is among the highest we've seen, while the whites are markedly dimmer than on the G2. Here's how it stacks up to other top flagships:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two screens differ wildly in sunlight legibility as well. The S5 is among the best we've seen in the current batch of flagships, while the LG G3's highly reflective display will make it a challenge to make out in bright environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've also seen Samsung's Air View, which detects your finger at about an inch distance thanks to its highly sensitive digitizer. It triggers special previews of image folders, messages and calendar events.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones are powered by Qualcomm chipsets and enjoy all the connectivity benefits that come with it. The Galaxy S5 beats out the G3 in the number of supported bands, especially when it comes to LTE, though both should have you well covered for whatever region you buy the device in. The two flagships also enjoy the fastest mobile data around with Cat. 4 LTE (up to 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up), but even without an LTE network where you are, they'll still go quite fast at 42.2Mbps down and 5.76 up courtesy of HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connections are blazing fast as well thanks to dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac (a/b/g/n are supported too). Bluetooth 4.0 is available for connecting accessories, although the S5 has the advantage of EDR in this regard. Both phones also support the ANT+ standard, which is popular with sports accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connectivity is where the two flagships start to diverge. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a microUSB 3.0 port, which will provide faster data transfers between the phone and a computer with a USB 3.0 port. It also integrates MHL 2.1, which means it can, with the right adapter, output 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones sport USB On-the-go as well, which means you'll be able to plug in expandable storage drives, although again you need the correct adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones feature NFC for use with tags and easy pairing with most devices. They also both have IR blasters to control electronic equipment at home, including TVs, disc players and even air conditioners. LG's QRemote app seems slightly more robust in this regard, but a software update or app store download could even things out in that regard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes in underhanded in this test due to its smaller 2,800mAh battery, compared to the 3,000mAh unit on the LG G3. The G3 may need every advantage it can get, as its large QHD screen should account for quite a bit of extra consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this section, we're still in the process of testing our newly arrived European G3 review unit, so we'll be using the figures we got from the Korean LG G3 we've had for a while. We'll update this section once we have the final numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is able to achieve a respectable score of 72 hours, which equates to exactly three days of usage on a single charge. The LG G3 achieves a very comparable score of 69 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3G talk time was one area where the LG G3 excelled. It ranks near the top of our battery life table in this aspect, scoring a full 3 hours longer than the S5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The decisive victory - or should we say embarrassing defeat - in the individual tests comes in the web browser department, where the Samsung Galaxy S5 enjoys nearly a three hour lead on its rival. The poor web browsing performance is one of the more disappointing aspects of the LG G3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things are a bit closer in the video playback test, although here the S5 still has an advantage over the G3 by about an hour. If you think about it in reverse, the S5 will be left with more charge in the battery after watching the same movie on both phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Samsung Galaxy S5 will likely last you longer than the LG G3 in an identical use pattern, although if you tend to do a lot of web browsing, the G3 will definitely disappoint. Both phones have super power-saving modes that disable some of the phone's features to extend the time to the next charge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interfaces<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the user interface on Android, different manufacturers take the time to add a fair dose of visual flair and functionality. As far as LG and Samsung are concerned, the two companies provide very similar user experiences - both sticking to the conventions put forth by Google while giving you an extensive array of extra features. The two rivals also vie to match each other in extras, so you'll find a lot of similarities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you an idea we have short videos showing both in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is into biometric sensors this generation and the fingerprint sensor on the Home key is a highlight. This enables a secure lockscreen that isn't based on passwords or patterns, instead you swipe a finger down the key. In case it fails (it happens when your fingers are wet, for example), then it falls back to a passcode so there's no danger of getting locked out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG doesn't have any fancy sensors to unlock with, but it does feature the company's proprietary Knock Code feature, that lets you get straight into the lockscreen via a series of taps on certain places on the screen - even when the screen is off. Otherwise, the other standard unlock methods as well as lockscreen widgets and shortcuts are available across both devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's homescreen looks fairly standard except the My Magazine feature replaces one of the homescreen panes. It's a news reader that will pull news and content from multiple sources in several categories and your social networking accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the LG G3 is reserved for the so-called Smart Bulletin, which is a special space similar Samsung's My Magazine (except not as robust). Smart Bulletin posts at-a-glance info from LG's Health app and Smart tips that highlight aspects of the phone's technology and usage, but nothing else beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast with the minimalist lockscreen, Samsung stuffed the notification area with features. Some of them we like - the quick toggles and brightness slider are used often enough to warrant a place here. The S Finder and Quick Connect buttons are debatable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we like is Recommended apps. It's a response to certain events, e.g. plugging in a pair of headphones brings out shortcuts for multimedia apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's notification area is more customizable. You can remove the brightness and volume sliders, or any of the toggles in the topmost row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S5 isn't limited to the lockscreen - in the co-called Private mode, it secures files (photos, videos, documents) in an encrypted part of the phone's storage. They are only visible when Private mode is on, which takes a finger swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor can also secure payments with PayPal. You can set up to three fingers to be recognized, so you can share the phone with someone and let them access Private mode and PayPal payments or keep those to yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG provides an equivalent feature to Private mode called Guest mode, which is virtually the same thing. It lets you pick which apps the guest has access to, including a custom Guest gallery of photos and videos, while restricting access to the settings or multitasking features of the G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For multitasking, Samsung pushes its Multi Window feature that puts two apps side by side. You can copy and paste text between them or snap a screenshot in one and use it in the other. Apps that go well together can be grouped into a single shortcut for added convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG can also run split screen apps with their own Dual window feature, which offers identical capabilities to Samsung's offering.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our review of the LG G3, we were left unimpressed by the underperforming Qualcomm MSM8975AC Snapdragon 801 chipset. Our Korean model G3 showed lower numbers when compared to other flagships, which could have been due to unfinalized hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we've retested with the LG-D855 model available in Europe and other regions, which should hopefully reflect a more finalized build than the one launched for the Korean market, despite having less RAM (our 16GB model comes with 2GB of RAM).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also comes with a Snapdragon 801 processor, except that it's of the Qualcomm MSM8974AC variety. It's also clocked in at 2.5GHz with four Krait 400 cores alongside an Adreno 330 GPU, so we're expecting similar performance across both devices - except when it comes to graphics benchmarks. In this latter case, the LG G3 has way more pixels to push out than its competition, so we're expecting slightly lower numbers due to the QHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to CPU performance, the European LG G3 again underperforms like its Korean version. Using Basemark OS II we see that Samsung's lead narrows.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Graphics benchmarks was where we expected the G3 to struggle more compared to other flagships, but again it surprises by coming in very close to the competition. The only real area where it struggled was in the onscreen Manhattan test, where the high screen resolution and the high-quality rendered graphics account for what seems to be a relatively poor performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG and Samsung have respectable camera divisions and compete in image quality as well as value-added features. We'll take a look at camera performance in the next chapter, but first we'll visit the multimedia apps each company has preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both galleries feature a standard tile view that can be sorted by album or time, among others, while the thumbnails themselves can be enlarged with a pinch zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gallery supports Facebook and Picasa, plus Dropbox. It can group photos not only by the people in them, but also in other categories: scenery, documents, pets, food, and vehicles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG gallery is a bit more pedestrian, and doesn't have as many sorting options. Editing is done through Google's Photos app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Music players are again very similar. They feature Now playing screens with prominent album art and playback options on the lockscreen and in the notification area. Both have great equalizer settings, with the G3 also letting you adjust pitch and playback speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a slight edge here with its Music square feature, which lets you build playlists automatically after you select a mood (Passionate or Joyful) and tempo (Exciting or Calm). The S5 also uses a similar square interface to simplify picking an equalizer setting, while Adapt sound can tune the settings automatically for your headphones by playing a series of beeps to assess which frequencies work and which don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Galaxy S5 suffers from relatively poor codec support. Notably DivX is missing, though the XviD works, as do MP4 and MKV files, which have overshadowed AVI in recent years. Unless they have multi-channel audio that is, as only MP3 and AAC sound works here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G3 has a very simple interface, more so than Samsung's, but is still very powerful. It doesn't have as many features as those found on the S5, but it does make up for it with the ability to play all sorts of file types and video/audio codecs - virtually everything we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support subtitles and carry over the sound options from their music players. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has Pop Up Play, which puts the video in a small, resizable window if you want to use another app while watching video. This is matched by the G3's QSlide function, which takes things a step further by letting you adjust the window transparency as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 results in the first part of our audio quality test are nothing short of amazing. The smartphone produced the best numbers we've ever seen including a perfect -100 on the stereo crosstalk score. Sadly, the volume levels weren't quite up with the best so we can't unequivocally crown the G3, but it will be for those that value cleanliness above loudness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones tells a similar story - the output is almost perfectly clean (the stereo crosstalk reading while excellent on its own, is no longer the best we've seen), while the volume levels are slightly below average. The volume level difference is far easier to spot, though, and it's in favor of the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5's camera has a wider field of view (FoV) than that of the LG G3, as it defaults to its 16:9 sensor. The G3 photos come out slightly taller than those of the S5, but it's only by about 130 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail is higher on the Galaxy S5 and this results in crisper images. There is a very faint trace of corner softness on the S5, while the G3 has perfect edge-to-edge sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices use some sort of noise suppression, but both are finely tuned as to not affect the image in a negative way (oil-paint effect). Up close, the level of detail is very similar, while the S5 is helped by its larger sensor when shooting medium to long distance objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color-wise, the two cameras are very accurate, although when looking at side-by-side samples, the S5 has a slightly more neutral color tone that we liked better than the LG's warmer tint. The S5 samples looked the more natural of the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved dynamic range was slightly in the favor of the LG G3, but contrast goes in favor of the S5. In both cases the differences between the two are minimal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This crop has the three primary colors visible - Red, Blue and Green. Neither phone is exactly spot on with the rendering - the contrast is a bit too much in both cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we see the superior resolved detail of the Galaxy S5, particularly in the foliage. The colors are also sharper and more pronounced on the S5, but there are also sharpening halos - on the stairwell and on the gray roof - something that the G3 doesn't have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some full res samples, if you feel like performing your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to HDR, both devices tell a much better story. Any problems with dynamic range are all but gone, and you get some very high quality shots with little to no drawbacks. Shooting speed is perhaps the biggest downside on the G3, as it takes significantly more time between shots. The S5 doesn't have such issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We moved to our dark room to try the low-light performance of both phones. The two phones have similar cameras, although the Galaxy S5 should enjoy slightly better performance with a wider f/2.2 aperture and larger 1/2.5" sensor, while the LG G3 has a regular f/2.4 lens and 1/3" sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test is with the flash off. The camera samples of both shooters have clear traces of camera shake. The Samsung Galaxy S5 photo was taken at 1/33s shutter speed and the color temperature leans towards red. The LG G3 chose to shoot at 1/20s and looks just about the same, except with a more natural white balance. The OIS doesn't seem to bring an extra benefit in terms of camera shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we enabled the LED flashes (which only work at relatively short distances) and took more photos. The Galaxy S5 retained its shutter speed but dropped the ISO to half, eliminating the handshake and capturing a good deal of detail. The white balance is still noticeably skewed towards the reds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 features a dual-tone flash and produced more natural looking flash images than the Galaxy S5. It dropped the shutter speed slightly to 1/25s, and retained its accurate white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, an LED flash really isn't effective beyond 2m / 6ft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, check out our Photo comparison tool that pits the two phones against each other, or any other device in our extensive database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G3 ? Samsung Galaxy S5 ? Sony Xperia Z2 Superior auto</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 lets you create Virtual tours (though you might be better off just shooting video) and packs a bundle of effects in Shot &amp; more (removing moving objects, cloning them and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done away with many of its identical extras in favor of a simpler interface. It does have the nifty magic focus feature, that lets you choose an object to focus on after you take the picture. It requires some setup and a steady hand, however.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since videos are shot in 16:9 mode, both phones have almost the same field of view, with the Galaxy S5 enjoying a slightly wider one. The LG G3 gets a little wider when you go from 2160p to 1080p, but it's nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that both phones are limited to just 5 minutes of 2160p videos, so if you need longer clips you'll have to settle for good old 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP4 containers with the AAC codec are the choice for 2160p videos, but the Samsung Galaxy S5 uses a higher framerate, 48Mbps, than the LG G3, 30Mbps. The two have the same audio bitrate, 128Kbps, and they both sound about the same in terms of fidelity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher bitrate gives the Galaxy S5 an advantage in terms of fine detail, and the colors are also more accurate thanks to the good exposure. In the 2160p sample below, the LG G3 has comparatively darker shadows, and the color temperature also gives things a slightly orange-ish tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 1080p resolution, things are a lot more even. The bitrate on the Galaxy S5 comes down to 17Mbps, while on the LG G3 you get a solid 20Mbps. The audio bitrate stays at 128Kbps for the S5, while on the G3 it actually goes up to 145Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the Galaxy S5 image still looks better, though the margin is very slim. The LG G3 is slightly behind in resolved detail and dynamic range, suffering from the same dark shadows as in 2160p mode.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 camcorder has some extra shooting modes - 1080p @ 60fps and 720p @ 120fps. The LG G3 also has 720p@120fps mode, but the quality is very poor and looks like it is upscaled from a much lower resolution. The Galaxy S5 has a video HDR mode as well, but it doesn't work at the highest available 2160p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices come with image stabilization, with the Samsung Galaxy S5 relying on software to do the trick, while the G3 has an actual hardware stabilizer. We've taken a quick side-by-side video of the stabilization in action - both results are very similar, but we'd have to say that the G3 ultimately does a better job.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't go into detail about the phone and messaging apps, but the flagships offers some features that deserve a mention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 offers in-call voice modes - including support for the cool Adapt sound feature from the music player. The LG G3 goes a bit farther by including HD voice settings, as well as the ability to reduce background noise and even enhance voice clarity in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is also pretty concerned with who calls you. Blocking mode disables notifications for calls and messages (even alarms and timers) during select periods. Only priority contacts can get through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will also help you fight off spam by blocking certain numbers from calling or sending messages. Other message features include delayed send, which waits 3 to 30 seconds before actually sending the message (you know how you spot a typo only after you've hit Send?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies worked on their own keyboards. They have the basics like predictive input, swipe typing, and even floating layouts. LG has added a lot of nifty tricks that let the keyboard learn from your habits, including not only commonly used/misspelled words, but also the ability to register key-presses differently so you make fewer mistakes while typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 lets you download Polaris Office 5 for free but you'll need to sign up for Samsung Apps. The LG G3, on the other hand, uses the ThinkFree Viewer for office applications, which doesn't allow for editing of files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to health and fitness tracking, Samsung is the premier smartphone manufacturer, thanks to their heart-rate sensor and robust S Health app. It tracks your calorie intake and exercises in detailed logs, and the heart rate monitor allows it to get a more accurate reading on how many calories you've burned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer-based step counter always works in the background, so you get credit for walking during the day too. S Health can connect wirelessly to external accessories - both over Bluetooth 4.0 and ANT+, and both Samsung-made and third-party accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's own Health app also performs basic fitness tracking functions, but feels more tacked on as a feature thrown in to compete with Samsung's offering in name only. It tracks basic activities including walking, running, and cycling, and you can create a LG account to compete with other LG Health users as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No matter how long and hard you look at the Android ecosystem, the Korean design excellence in both hardware and software cannot be denied. Over the last several years, Samsung has proven countless times why it deserves to be the number one smartphone manufacturer, taking a robust technological offering from Google and making it even more capable. LG, however, has grown tired of sitting on the sidelines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 wouldn't have been what it was if not for the high bar set by the Samsung Galaxy S4. With the G3, LG came not as a follower, but a pioneer decisively stepping out of their compatriot's shadow. By being the first manufacturer to offer a QHD screen on a smartphone, LG has thrown down the gauntlet and beaten Samsung in its own game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But at what cost? Despite doing very well by including the impressive screen with only a minimal markup in terms of overall size, the impressive-looking flagship is left behind its main rivals when it comes to horsepower. Taking into account that LG's engineers had several months to fine tune the performance due to the G3's late release, it was expected that the device would be able to hold its own on that front. Well, it does not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were hoping that the eventual European version would be more finalized in that regard, bringing the G3 up to par with the competition, but that also turned out to be wishful thinking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we just can't ignore that screen. QHD content is the same impressive jump as when 1080p was first introduced, and as more of it becomes available it should make the G3 even more viable - at least until other QHD devices get released.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A technological tour-de-force and sweeping financial success, the Galaxy S line is loved and loathed, watched and imitated. LG was one manufacturer which grew tired of the latter, and took a gamble by being the first to introduce a QHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 enjoyed the largest ever global rollout of a Galaxy device, and was able to sell 11 million units in its first month alone. Needless to say that's a steep mountain to climb for the likes of the G3, and it may not be able to rest on the laurels of its superior screen alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 has all the features you would expect of a 2014 flagship, but the Samsung Galaxy S5 expertly backs apps with hardware features - the fingerprint and heart rate scanners enable functionality outside the reach of even the Apple iPhone 5s (where the fingerprint reader is exclusive to native services). The software package is one that LG struggles to meet but ends up merely imitating at best, resulting in very few characteristics that are uniquely LG, and many that are "borrowed" from Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware-wise the Galaxy S5 is hardly the best looking flagship around, particularly when it comes to design. Although the Galaxy S5 saw a refresh of the hyperglaze back panel, almost every competing flagship offers an arguably better finish, including the LG G3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gamble that LG took with the G3 this could ultimately end up paying off, but past trends indicate that the Samsung has responded well to challenges from its rivals. But until that time comes, the unmatched screen, the excellent camera, and compelling design make the G3 a tough one to beat, despite its shortcomings. The Korean derby will only be getting more interesting to watch. That's for sure. Not everyone will end up choosing a side - but many will be tempted.</paragraph>
