			<paragraph>It is the first Nokia phone with a touchscreen display - with a huge display. Running on new version of Symbian OS, the Nokia 7710 has a megapixel camera and extensive multimedia features. We have made a very detailed review.</paragraph>

			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 communicator review wasn't a piece of cake for me. Although I was using the mobile a lot for several days, I was doubtful until the end. Nokia 7710 is brand new type of mobile device and I have to admit we were "fighting" from time to time. On the other hand, I read reactions of the first users, who are basically exhilarated, so I cannot take just my feelings for the evaluation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is a multimedia widescreen smartphone. There is no keypad, just a wide touchscreen display with pen input. This phone is meant for people who I dare to call "pioneers". With Nokia 7710 they stand right on the start of a platform that can be successful or a flop - that is what makes it so exciting. Nokia 7710 will entertain them; they can play with it, boast with it and have a good feeling of "being the first".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is the first smartphone based on Symbian Series 90. It was supposed to be Nokia 7700 initially, but its development was stopped and here they come with a smaller and lighter successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More like a game console<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For common work, Nokia 7710 is held flatways, like Nokia N-Gage. Only for telephony, it is held as a normal mobile phone. Comparing to mobile phones it is a very big device, 128 x 70 x 19 mm, but compared to smartphones it is about the average. The same stands for the weight of 180 g; it is elephantine for a mobile phone and about normal for a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Comparing sizes: with Nokia 6630 ? in hand ? on a CD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a bright variant of the smartphone available. I haven't found on Nokia web page how many color variants will be available but I have seen some pictures of dark versions. Covers are not replaceable; it is possible to remove just a back shell that is covering a battery. I do not have underlying remarks to the construction of the phone but some reproaches are coming on from the users of the smartphone, considering facing of the covers. I can say that a tested piece is O.K. in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> It is possible to remove back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is a block with slightly rounded side edges. The display is not placed symmetrically but it is moved a bit right; the left border is bigger than the right one. Holding the phone with both hands the right thumb touches straight the cursor key with confirmation button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Yellow cast on the display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the phone is really huge, we haven't seen bigger at any Nokia yet and I don't even remember any other phone or a smartphone, which can compete with the 7710's display. The display sizes are 80 x 50 mm, 90 mm diagonally and it feature resolution 640 x 320 pixels. Moreover it is extremely crisp, with 5120 pixels on 1 square cm. Of course it is active and displays 65K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The illumination is not really regular - the display is noticeably darker in the corners and in the right part. Considerable imperfection is the strong yellow cast. It is not so visible on our pictures, because the camera was set on auto white balance, but actually the yellowish display stroked my eye straight after I switched it on for the first time. The graphics and pictures representation is otherwise perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Display looks pretty white on the pictures but that's thanks to the camera support.Actually the display is distinctly yellowish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally - the same as other color displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it goes with devices like that, a large display gets dirty very easily. Just touch it to your face during a call or touch it by a finger when you are too lazy to take out the pen. Nokia knows well why they included a rag in the standard package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Confusing keys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Part of the control keys is placed on the side edge. These are keys for calls control (green and red earphone) and a voice recorder key. All keys have also other functions, e.g. call register opening or voice dial activation. Next, still on the side edge, you can find a key that releases the back cover. Removing the cover is quite tricky, the other three keys need to be pressed properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Call control keys ? back cover lock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is just a main switch button placed on the right side. It is jointed with control of ringing profiles. On the left bottom there we can find a Pop-Port system connector. Here I have one remark for the construction. The connector is protected by a metal case, which is in contact with a plastic cover. If you press it, the plastic slides on metal edge and you can hear an unpleasant sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Switch button ? Pop-Port connector and slot for charger; the small slot in the corner is the microphone</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the first sight, it seems that keys on the front part are placed completely chaotically. On the left side is positioned the already mentioned cursor key with confirmation button in the middle. Below that there is a key used for roll out the menu of actual application and for shifting among bookmarks in dialogues. The key for going back to the main display is touching it by its corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keys on the left side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bar with the list of the running applications appears when you hold the key that is used for going back to the desktop. That is the way to switch from one program to another. Applications are usually not running on the background, hence, it is not possible to look somewhere else while waiting for a web page to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By holding the key, you can see the list of the running applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three keys on the right side. The functions of two of them are different in various applications; the bottom one is the escape key. The earphone is in the middle. The keys on the front side are not illuminated, contrary to the volume control keys on the upper edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keys on the right side</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Normal size card<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A big battery appears after removal of the back cover. The battery has different size than any other Nokia phone. It is Li-Pol battery with 1300 mAh capacity. The producer claims that the smartphone with battery like that lasts up to 14 days on standby or max 12 hours of calls. In fact, I had to charge the phone every day during the testing. Charging takes about three hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Look under the back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a memory card slot under the back cover. This time Nokia has used normal size MMC card, not a reduced size version. The card is exchangeable during phone's operation; it is necessary to remove back cover first (the phone can recognize the removal). You will get a 128 MB memory card in the package; the smartphone itself features 90 MB internal memory. You cannot insert a SD format memory card in the phone; it just does not fit into the slot. It is necessary to remove the battery to access the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Memory card slot and space for a SIM card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The input stylus is hidden in the right front corner of the smartphone. It is a plastic stick with a metal decoration in its upper part. If you lose your stylus, you will find a spare one in the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The stylus is hidden in a slot in the corner</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia also delivers with the phone a specially constructed black leather case. It protects the smartphone from damage and the display from dirt. It is possible to make calls with the phone in the case if you really try but the sound is not good enough. There are ports in the case for a system connector, for removal of the stylus, for the switch button and three keys for calls control. Unfortunately, it is not possible to hang the case on a belt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The controls are accessible even if the phone is in the case</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A good camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the embossed Nokia sign on the back of the phone you will find the camera lens. It features 1 MP resolution and you can form your opinion looking at the sample pictures. Comparing the pictures of Nokia 7710, it is obvious they do not belong to the top of the camera phones but on the other hand, it is really not bad. It depends much on the conditions, taken scene and on luck, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 makes better picture from a longer distance than from a shorter; in the latter case, the picture is fuzzy. If you do not need the highest resolution, try middle format 640 x 480 pixels. It makes excellent pictures (see the sample below). The centre of the cursor key is used as a shutter release. Taking pictures is comfortable if you hold the phone in both hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera lens on the backside</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting application can be started only from the menu; there is no key shortcut available. The taken scene is displayed in a small frame in the center. For changing the settings it is necessary to roll out the menu and only 2x zoom is available. The settings menu offers you contrast and brightness adjustment but it is necessary to experiment, as you have to quit the setting dialog to view the result. In addition you can select where the pictures will be saved and to set a picture size in three levels. You can switch off the preview of the picture before saving or set a picture's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera environment ? picture settings ? video recording environment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                 With and without zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pictures in 640 x 480 resolution look good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 can also record a video up to 60 minutes with resolution 176 x 144 pixels in 3GP format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Picture gallery: with preview on the left, text list on the right</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How do we call?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia 7710, we call as with a normal phone. We hold it in hand "standing", which means that the receiver is in the top part. Nokia 7710 is generally intended for right-handers who can use keys on the left side together with the pen or holding the pen in the left hand as well. For telephony it is possible to use the delivered headphones or a Bluetooth connected handsfree.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After you turn on the Nokia 7710 it displays the main desktop with many icons of the integrated and later installed items. The user can easily modify the desktop item's layout: put them on the desktop wherever he wants. The icons need not to stand only for applications; it is possible to assign a shortcut to any file. To avoid the chaos on the desktop, the user can sort icons to various groups and use them for filtering of the display. There are many icons - 44 in my case and I installed just a few programs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Desktop: huge list of applications and other shortcuts ? creating new group of shortcuts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 supports graphic themes, so called Motifs, which allows you to change a look of the user interface. In the phone that I have available there are two themes and I am sure that others will appear on the Internet. Moreover, Nokia released a Theme Studio tool, which can be used for creating customized graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Darker motif</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What can we see on the display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Series 90 display consists of several sections:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is good that individual bars can be mostly manually switched off and in some application you can even activate a full screen mode. So the application's desktop can have several resolutions:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Workspace resolution 480 x 218 ? 480 x 250 ? 607 x 218 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Workspace resolution 607 x 250 o full screen mode 640 x 320 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can select a size of the font and graphic objects in three levels for most of the programs. You do not have to go to the menu; one of the keys on the right side can do it. Each application remembers its own setting. I personally prefer the most detailed view, where the font is really extremely small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Three levels of zoom at the desktop</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Three levels of zoom in the messages menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fingers control<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even that hardware keys can control smartphone's basic functions, you cannot do without the stylus. The latter is necessary every time when you need to enter characters, it is also necessary to tap on various icons and other items. For example, only the stylus can control buttons in the command bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Application for calibration the touchscreen display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is impossible to connect a Bluetooth keypad; you have to choose from two methods of typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is a keypad on the display: when you tap to a text field it displays a drawn keypad - either small or big, it depends on the setting. With the stylus you peck on the letters and put the words together. If you choose the big keypad, it is possible to press the keys by fingers. It could be better: the fingers control would have been very comfortable if the keypad can be stretched over the whole display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad for typing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Setting of entering the characters ? language selection ? small version of the keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you can use handwriting recognition: when you tap on a text field, it displays a small frame, where you can write with the pen. Identification is reliable but if a person has a specific handwriting it is possible to learn the smartphone for each letter individually. The frame with the software keypad and with a block for entering the characters can be moved anywhere on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Learning mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How to write?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From the two methods of writing I used more the second one. The identification method is very reliable; moreover, it is not necessary to wait for representation of every letter. Just write the characters fast one by one and the smartphone will fold them up then. It is sure that you have to be in standstill during writing or typing; it doesn't work by walking. This is what makes the 7710 a bit unpractical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrary to other touchscreen systems, it differs by way of taping the stylus on the icons. Single tap is the same but a double tap works like with the old Psions. It doesn't matter on the time duration between two taps. You can tap once and for the second time in five minutes if you want; fast double-tap is not necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Series 90 supports work with clipboard - it is possible to copy, cut and paste items. The clipboard is controlled from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running applications cannot be closed in a standard way. There is an applications manager that can do it, but you have to shift to the manager first. The system doesn't mind that programs remain open; it will close them by itself when more memory is needed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ouch, stability!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is regrettably quite slow machine. You have to wait until the application is loaded in the memory and the reactions to the user input are not instant. Although I am, in this respect, very tolerant to the smartphones and I do not irritate e.g. at the speed of Nokia 9500, which is often under strong criticism, I suffer a bit with the tested 7710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I cannot praise the stability also. I had to restart Nokia 7710 several times by removing the battery, because it stopped responding at all. It happened mostly at the Internet browser but also during emails reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian Series 90 is a completely new operating system and there are just few applications at this time. It is interesting that sometimes it allows us to install applications designed for smartphones series 80. For example, I installed Agile Messenger for instant messaging to Nokia 7710. On the memory card, you can find several demo versions of programs and games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  "Warning" before running a demo - three times and stop ? Agile Messenger in version for smartphones 9300/9500 works also on the 7710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   One of the demos: mobile guide </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 supports Java and here are the jBenchmark tests results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some games available:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calling with an excellent sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia 7710 the numbers are dialed by tapping on keys shown on the display. You can take out the pen for that or simply use fingers. Initially you have to unlock the keypad and the display by pressing two keys. Each one of them is on one side of the smartphone and you cannot do it by one hand. In addition, you must watch the display as there is no key response. To receive an incoming call just press a key on the side of the phone or tap on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad in basic state ? entering a number ? fast selection panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Dialing a number ? call progress ? missed call and incoming message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have to praise the quality sound, both of the earphone and of the loud handsfree. That is how it sounds when a big device can take a big speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Really big speaker ? grids for sound in the back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone book uses shared memory; it is not limited by a number of names or items. Synchronization with a PC works just perfect; you can do it just with a normal PC Suite version, without installing any other application. We can look at the contacts in two views: simple, which is used during telephony, and complete, where you can see all items.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Searching can be slow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Searching in the phone book is a bit slower. It works by consecutive writing of initial characters of a name to a field, but it is necessary to wait quite long until the phone filters entire database (I have more than 500 contacts in my phonebook). Sometimes it could be faster to use directly a sliding bar but this way of searching is very sensitive in large lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Searching in a simple and in a big phone book</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is great that you can set a template for displaying the contacts. There will be only the items that you need, not a complete structure of the database. Then you can add other fields to each contact. The structure of the phone book is extensive, I am sure it will be sufficient. Every name can be assigned with a picture, which appears during the call, and with a personal ringing tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Two details of the contact view ? contacts template</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 supports ringing profiles with filtering by groups. The ringing is - thanks to a big speaker - high quality. Besides MID files with 24 voices polyphony, it is possible to use MP3, AMR, WAV, AAC and RealAudio music files. A special profile is available, so you can switch off the phone part and use the device as a pocket computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Selection of ringing profiles and their setting</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Proper music mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 supports music formats so let's go to the multimedia applications and firstly to a MP3 player. We can listen to the music with delivered headphones (stereo) and over a loud speaker (mono). The quality of the sound is very good in both cases. I compared identical songs played at Nokia 7710 and at Apple iPod with standard headphones (of course it is not like with Koss Porta Pro) - the phone should play more bass, but the difference is not so big. No doubt, it would play a better sound with normal headphones, but traditionally there is no standard port for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have found that Nokia is coming out with a Pop-Port to 3.5 mm plug adapter. The producer claims that the adapter is compatible only with a new model 6881. I dear to doubt and believe that in this case it will work also with other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standard headphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph> MP3 player environment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is possible to load playlists from PC to the phone but they cannot be created right in there. Users can listen MP3 files on background; music is muted during a call but once a call is finished the playback is not restored by itself, it should be done manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Visual Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 features Visual Radio. This function is based on synchronized transmission of normal FM broadcasting with graphical information via GPRS/EDGE. Therefore, you can easily see on the display what song is actually played or other details, also it is a solution for various competitions etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In countries where Visual Radio is not supported Nokia 7710 works as an ordinary radio receiver after you connect the headphones, which work as an antenna. The radio has more "tinny" sound than the MP3 player. You can store twenty stations to the memory. You can also use an Internet service which stores stations to the phone automatically; just choose a city. As with the MP3 player, the radio will not restore automatically after finished call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Radio doesn't play without the headphones; not over the handsfree ? radio environment</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is equipped with RealPlayer for playing video. In fullscreen mode it is really a good multimedia experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video records overview ? playback in a small window and in fullscreen mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia will offer an accessory Nokia Streamer SU-22 (not included in the standard package). When connected to Nokia 7710, it allows watching digital TV in chosen countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TV module will be probably plugged to some of the connectors under the back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Normal messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are back at boring functions of a mobile phone, namely at messages. Nokia 7710 understands text messages, multimedia messages and emails. Because it is a smartphone, one can install instant messaging application and in some time Push to Talk function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Inbox (fullscreen mode with a command bar) ? folders with messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One application is managing all messages - I especially mind long time lags; especially when the system releases it from the memory. Text messages editor is clear and it counts down written characters from the beginning. In addition, you can activate delivery reports (for all messages or individually) but the report will appear on the display for couple of seconds, it is not saved anywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing a text message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In multimedia messages editor all objects are composed on a page so a text appears beside a picture. You can insert a graphical file, a video from the memory, to add a sketch drawn with the pen, a music file or just captured image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  It's possible to draw on the touchscreen display ? and send the result in an MMS ? of course you can insert a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email is not bad but we have seen better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Email browser supports POP3 and IMAP4 protocols, you can work with more accounts at once. Possibilities are quite standard; mailbox handling could be better from ergonomics point of view. I have the same reproach to some other applications: they permanently push me to open the menu and search for necessary command. I would appreciate just a simple icon on the display. Nokia 7710 allows for messages a manual setting of functions assignment to three software buttons on the command bar but you can choose only among four selections without Receive emails function?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Emails overview ? you have to go through the menu to download an email</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?but you can set an automatic check of emails in remote mailbox or to set an interval (5 minutes minimum), days and time range when it will download emails. You can also select whether you want to download just headers or complete emails with attachments. Additionally, SMTP verification, secure connection and ports settings are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 can read HTML formatted emails and moreover, it keeps their formatting. Of course, it handles sending and receiving attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HMTL formatted email ? message with attachments</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email client is not bad but compared to Nokia 9300 and 9500 mail clients, lacks some functionality and usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is equipped with applications, which can handle the most important office documents. There is a text editor, spreadsheet processor, presentations viewer and Acrobat Reader (install on demand). With the text editor and the spreadsheet processor, it is possible to create text documents and tables right in the smartphone, the rest are just viewers without a possibility to edit anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I practiced the potential of these programs with several documents with different difficulty level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Simple text in Word: no remarks. After editing the text in the smartphone, I sent a document to a PC where all changes I made were displayed correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Word document in the smartphone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Simple table in Excel: I opened a file in the smartphone and it looked exactly as in a PC Excel. After editing, I loaded the file to a PC where all changes were shown correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Simple table </paragraph>
			<paragraph>More complicated text in Word: it was a news release with a graphical header and advanced formatting. Graphics in header on the 7710 disappeared and I discovered some problems with text alignment on width - there were frequently big spaces between words because the 7710 cannot split. Otherwise, the text was readable without problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Graphical header is gone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More complicated table in Excel, including formulas and graphs: In this case the conversion during the file opening took longer. The table looked visually good but only simple formulas were transferred correctly (addition, subtract ?). For example, instead of basic function SUMA just a result number appeared. On the other hand, the graphs were looking well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   On the cursor's place there should be a formula =SUMA() ? graphs were transferred correctly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint presentation: pictures are displayed correctly. Because Nokia 7710 has different format of display than computers, pictures are either small or too large for the display. Therefore, it is suitable to use widescreen format for presentations at the 7710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PDF documents: PDF is quite massive format and its viewing is quite uncomfortable, as with other pocket devices. Still it is better, of course, than not to read a PDF file at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  PDF document: By representation, I would say that Acrobat Reader was originally designed for smartphones 9300/9500 with narrower display </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great for time organization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Clock application displays two world cities of your selection. You can set several alarms and select a repetition for every one of them: daily, weekly or in weekdays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clock and alarm</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has daily, a weekly and monthly view. As with the phonebook, it can be synchronized with a PC and I am pleased with the calendar possibilities. The time organization can be set in respect of subject, location, start, end, reminder, repetition and note. To-do list is another application, but single tasks can be also displayed in the calendar at a relevant date. Nokia 7710 does not contain Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Monthly and daily view in the calendar ? weekly view</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Adding a new item to the calendar ? new task</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key on the side of the phone controls the voice recorder. Record length is limited by the memory size only; you can set whether to record in AMR or WAV format; recording a call in progress is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I find the calculator a bit confusing due to its ornamented keys. It ignores priorities of some mathematical operations. The Converter application is doing exactly what you expect it should.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Two looks of the calculator ? units converter</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>To the Internet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 supports GPRS and EDGE class 10, a connection via HSCSD is possible too. Nokia knows how to add Wi-Fi to its smartphones, but they forget to add it to 7710. The infrared port is also missing. The smartphone includes a hardware modem that connects to a PC via a USB cable or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Active GPRS connection ? transferred data counter</paragraph>
			<paragraph> List of data and voice connections ? detailed information</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Bluetooth handling </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right in the phone there is an Internet browser. This is the place where you will appreciate the advantage of the widescreen display. The web pages are displayed as on the computer; they are not deformed in any way. The rendering of the web pages on full screen is great. However, even if you use the biggest enlargement the font in the browser is still very small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browser's basic page ? bookmarks ? Mobil Mania text version </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is acceptably fast compared to Nokia 9300 and 9500 internet browsers. Sometimes the 7710 decides to strike and gets frozen for a while; I had to take out the battery several times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Graphical MobilMania in a window ? fullscreen CNN </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only in the Internet browser, there is a context menu, which appears after holding the pen on one place. At a hyperlink, it offers for example an option to open it in a new window. It is a pity that this is not available in other applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What else?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now I am just going through all the icons and looking for what I have not mentioned yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files manager:  its function is clear but with limited functionality - it doesn't let you go out of the documents folder</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Control panel:  smartphone's settings centre</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search: function for searching in all databases and files in the smartphone. It doesn't matter where a searched string is located - it searches everywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>MobiReader: install on demand reader of e-books. Reading is very comfortable on the large display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   E-book in a window ? and in fullscreen </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Right or wrong?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The end of the review will be doubtful, just as the beginning. Perhaps we all agree that Nokia 7710 is a pioneer; that there was no similar device before. Other opinions will differ. There are people who adore the touchscreen display with pen input. The 7710 will be an ideal smartphone for them. Users, who are convinced that there is nothing more effective than a key shortcut, should focus on other products, for example smartphones Nokia Series 60. I am one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Besides the phone, you will find in the package a charger, simple stand, headphones, USB cable, MMC memory card, spare stylus, CD and guides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From functions point of view Nokia 7710 is very well equipped. I do not have remarks to its functions and if there are some, they are related more to the control and the ergonomics. I am still telling to myself that maybe I am a fud who just does not see that the future is in the touchscreen display and pen input. That is why I hesitate to point out a definite conclusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Simple folding stand </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is sure that the performance of the 7710 could be better. Time lags are appreciable and they can make the work unpleasant. Improving the performance should be the main goal to the next version of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7710 is not a smartphone for everybody and Series 90 has, at this time, lower potential than Series 60 and 80. Normal user will not appreciate all the possibilities of the system - it is too sophisticated. That should be the advantage for people that we call "technoids". They will certainly like Nokia 7710.</paragraph>
