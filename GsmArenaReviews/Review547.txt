			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Asus had a full bag of devices, but many of them have been previously announced. Still, we couldn?t say no to a second hands-on tour. The Asus ZenFone Zoom and ZenFone 2 Deluxe impressed with some unique features, while the Max, Laser and Selfie simply aim to excel at what they do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year tech shows are dominated by wearables and Asus had the ZenWatch 2 to show off. Coming in two sizes and plenty of customization options it holds the promise of a practical, affordable smartwatch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone Zoom hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zoom is on its way to European markets but we got a sneak peek. The phone is built around a 13MP camera with a 10-element Hoya lens with 3x optical zoom. The lens is a periscope type, which means the mechanism is entirely internal and nothing sticks out when you zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This mechanism allowed Asus to make the ZenFone Zoom as thin as it is ? at 12mm it's a good deal thinner than the Galaxy K zoom (one of few comparable phones), though it still feels pretty chunky. The metal unibody weighs 185g, surprisingly not the heaviest phone we've handled despite the extra weight from the zoom mechanism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Zoom does have that characteristic "camera phone" hump that reminds us of the Lumia 1020, though here the camera module isn?t nearly as prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3x optical zoom can be digitally extended to 12x, another mode fuses four photos into a single 52MP Super Resolution shot. Asus says the camera is great at shooting up close too ? getting to 5cm (a couple of inches) of its subject for macro shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a Panasonic SmartFSI image sensor and optical image stabilization and laser autofocus for accurate focus locks in just 0.2 seconds. A dual-LED, dual-tone flash promises accurate rendering of colors and especially skin tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you look on the side of the phone you'll see an unusual dual shutter key arrangement. Unusual for phones that is, on camera's it's much more common ? having a separate still and video shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the zoom mechanism limits how wide the aperture can be. Smartphone modules have gotten to f/1.8, but the ZenFone Zoom ranges from f/2.7 to f/4.8 (depending on the zoom).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone part of the Asus ZenFone Zoom is more casual. It's built on a ZenFone 2 base meaning a 5.5" 100p screen, quad-core Intel processor with 4GB of RAM and Android with ZEN UI. We found the ZenUI camera app more interesting, mostly for the Manual mode that gives you control over shutter speed, exposure value, white balance, ISO and other settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus ZenFone 2 Deluxe has a distinctive tessellated back (modeled after natural crystals). Unlike the Oppo R1C back this is a real 3D pattern, which feels incredible in the hand. The 500+ triangles that form the back trace a nicely curved shape that's quite pleasant to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone looks as impressive as it feels too. The back has a "chameleon-like" coating, which subtly changes color depending on angle. And since each triangle is at a slightly different angle, it's quite a show. To that end the Illusion Blue look better than the Illusion White to our eyes as the effect was stronger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unique back may be top-level stuff, but the phone itself is more of an impressive mid-ranger. The strong ZenFone 2 base shows clearly - a 5.5" 1080p screen is surrounded by modest amounts of bezel, while q quad-core Intel processor with 4GB of RAM breezes through daily tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that there are two versions with the same model name ? one has a Z3580 chipset (CPU at 2.3GHz) and the other has a Z3560 chipset (CPU at 1.8GHz). Both run Android 5.1 with Zen UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus is offering 64GB and 128GB versions of the ZenFone 2 Deluxe and if that's not enough you can plug in a 128GB microSD card. It's becoming increasingly rare these days, but we had no complaints about storage with this one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus ZenWatch 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus ZenWatch 2 is also coming to the old continent soon. The new model did not make the jump to a round screen, sticking with the more practical (though arguably less attractive) rectangular shape. It's an AMOLED screen that comes in 1.63" and 1.45" sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal body of the phone is 49mm and 45mm respectively and with a metal wrist band has a pleasant weight to it (many smartwatches are too light for fans of traditional timepieces). Asus had a dizzying array of body color (silver, gunmetal and rose gold) and strap combos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the stainless steel link bracelet is really nice. It comes in the same color options as the watch body. The leather straps offer different colors and while Asus intended them for more fashionable situations, the leather quality was a bit of a letdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a premium leather strap embossed with a diamond pattern and studded with Swarovski crystals. It was a little kitschy for our tastes, but we can easily see other people making it work with the right outfit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are rubber bands for those who plan on using the ZenWatch 2 to keep track of their runs. We'd never pick a rubber band as our only one, it just makes the watch look cheap. Still, we know better than to try sweating with a leather band (it ruins it quickly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of exercise, the watch has a built-in pedometer (with "industry-leading" accuracy) but lacks a heart rate monitor. It is IP67 rated so running in the rain is certainly no issue, though it's not enough for swimming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has provided a number of software feature alternatives to what Android Wear provides natively. The Wellness manager is just one, there's also the Smart Assistant and Business Helper (these partially rely on Zen software).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZenWatch Message is a watch-to-watch communication tool with a decidedly Apple flavor, though stock Android Wear has similar functionality too (and works with non-Asus watches). In case you haven?t heard, the ZenWatch 2 and other Wear watches can now link up with iPhones too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Asus is promising two days of battery life on a single charge. Thanks to improved battery charging times you can get a day's worth of juice in just 36 minutes with the magnetic charger.</paragraph>
