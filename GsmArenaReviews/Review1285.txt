			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 5 is no news anymore. It was announced back in June at the WWDC along with the iCloud service. Apple has fulfilled its promise for a fall release and iOS 5 is finally seeding to all compatible iDevices around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've followed all the iOS 5 beta versions you've probably heard everything you need to know about it. But don?t worry in case you've missed those early builds, we?ll cover everything in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important note to make is that this is a review of iOS5 as it?s available on the iPhone 4. The specific iPhone 4S perks will be covered in a separate review once we get the handset itself. Now before we continue, let's take a look at the most important features premiering on the iOS 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still missing:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, the list is notably shorter than last year's. Apple continues the tradition of bringing missing key features, so that's not surprising. As most of the Apple fans have already understood, some of the missing things will probably stay missing for a long time, since they go against the Apple policy (like the Flash support or the USB mass storage or the native Bluetooth or USB Mass storage functionality is against the very principles of the closed iOS eco-system).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough with the teasers, let's see the new iOS 5 in action.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface on iOS 5 - same looks, new features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple's iOS must be already approaching the final stage of its evolution. The platform has certainly been through a lot. This is the fourth major update, and it brings less change than the others. It's not to say the iOS is finally close to what Apple had in mind for it. And by the way - what Apple has in mind is not necessarily what users have come to take for granted or other platforms have had forever. But when you have the standard-setting touchscreen interface you can afford to make your own rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all we know, iOS may as well be still a few updates away from a complete overhaul, the scale of Windows Phone 7. So let?s focus on the here and now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple says the iOS 5 brings more than 200 new features. We didn't bother counting them, but the really interesting things are about 40 at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There have been virtually no visual changes to the core interface. Graphically, the only new thing you'll notice around the Settings menu is the new look of the toggle switches ? they're now circles instead of squares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go straight to one of the most important novelties though - the iOS 5 has a new approach to Notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users receive notifications both on the lockscreen and on the homescreen - and there's an Android-like pull-down Notification center. You can set the behavior for each app's notifications: view in Notifications Center on/off, view on Lock Screen on/off, Badge icon on/off, number of shown items 1/5/10 and alert style - off/banner/pop-up alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system is pretty flexible and configurable now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications on the lockscreen are displayed only as long as you unlock the phone. The next time you lock it, they are all gone even if you haven?t checked them up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To access an event from the lockscreen, just slide its icon left-to-right just as you would unlock the phone. Simple as that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications on the homescreen or any running app can be displayed in two ways - as a banner at the top of the screen or as a pop-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification banner at the top stays for a few seconds and then disappears. If you tap on it you will be taken to the relevant app. The pop-up alert appears at the center of the screen and has two buttons - View and Dismiss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the pull-down Notification Center works just like the notifications in Android. You can access the Notification Center from anywhere in the interface. If you are in an app, let's say a game, if you accidentally swipe on the notification area, you won't bring the notification center, but just a small virtual handle. If you really need to access the Notification Center, you'll need to pull it down from that handle. It does pause the app below, so there?s no chance that you crash your car in Real Racing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center displays all your pending alerts. You can enable/disable and rearrange the alerts from the Notification settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center supports widgets too. Currently there are only two to choose from - Weather and Stocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has added dictionary support working in all the native iOS apps such as Safari, Mail, Notes, etc. If you tap and hold on a word and then choose Define from the popup balloon, you'll be redirected to word definition in the integrated iOS dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dictionary is not a stand-alone app, it works just when you select a word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three more things we need to mention related to the general interface. The first one is the dedicated Camera shortcut on the lockscreen. You can bring it up the same way you invoke the music controls - with a double click of the Home button. The camera key appears right next to the Unlock slider and will launch the Camera app when tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app got hourly forecast, just tap on the weather pane and it will reveal itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the calendar has got a brand new weekly view, you just have to turn your iPhone in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing is the Newsstand app on your homescreen, which displays as a homescreen folder. All the periodicals you buy at the App Store will go there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>iMessage service - free messaged between all supported iOS devices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is another useful thing premiering with the iOS 5 - the iMessage service, which is integrated into the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5-running iGadgets via Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To activate the iMessage you just need to go to Settings-&gt;Messages and turn it on. But how does it work?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You tap on the new message button and you'll see the standard message composer with a green SEND key. When you choose a recipient you'll notice a small loading icon right next to the name. If the person you are texting has the iMessage service, your SEND key will turn blue and the top bar will say New iMessage instead of New Message. Yes, it?s all automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service is essentially an IM - in an iMessage conversation you can see when the other person is typing and you get their messages instantly. You can also get Read Receipts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing about iMessage - your ID is either your phone number or your email - just as in FaceTime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony - same old phonebook, new sound alerts, FaceTime email identification<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has seen almost no changes and there is still no smart dialing in the dialer (you have the system wide Spotlight search for that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new thing is the Related people field in the phonebook. Unlike the iOS 5 beta though where it allowed you to add labels such as mother, father, parent, brother, sister, child, friend, spouse, partner, assistant, manager and other, the iOS 5 final version offers only three - spouse, assistant and manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new thing about the telephony on iOS is that finally, the mail, voicemail, calendar and reminder sound alerts are customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don?t like the provided tones and you don?t know how to make one yourself, you can now choose Buy More Tones directly from the sound settings. You will be redirected to the iTunes Tones Store (the iTunes app) and you can buy whatever tones you like there. It?s that easy, if you are lazy enough to pay for ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime on the iPhone also gets a new feature. If your carrier does not support FaceTime, you could still activate it with your email as ID. It's done automatically if the activation with phone number fails. Just make sure you are connected to a Wi-Fi network and turn the FaceTime on from Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also choose your FaceTime ID - even if you use email activation, you could still use your mobile phone number for identification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New Mail app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mail app used to take a lot of stick but most of the missing features have finally made it into the iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open your Inbox and hit the Edit button, you now have a Mark key alongside Move and Delete. You can now mass mark emails as read/unread or flag them as important. Unfortunately, a "Select All" option is still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple also added Bold, Italic and Underline font styles to the text editing options as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold&amp;select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add or delete Mail folders now - just hit the Edit button when you explore the email account.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social network integration has been a long-requested feature on iOS devices, but why limit it to Twitter only? Well, it?s the Apple way or the highway. Now about that Twitter integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a separate Twitter tab in Settings. You can sync your Twitter contacts to the phonebook or you can search your existing contacts for matching Twitter ID?s. Another addition is a Tweet option in the Share menus across the UI (Maps, YouTube, Safari, etc.) next to Email, Print, MMS, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are we the only ones that find this popup way too big already? Just kidding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage multiple Twitter accounts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The new camera app - grid, swipe for gallery, pinch to zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Camera app on the iPhone 4 has been enhanced with a viewfinder grid, an HDR setting, pinching gesture for digital zoom, a new excuse for the lack of a proper hardware shutter key and swipe gesture for quick gallery access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All fine and dandy - but making the volume key double as a camera key is more like guerilla tactics used by third-party hacks to make up for the missing hardware feature. But when a manufacturer himself resorts to a rather makeshift solution as this hack, it does little good - other than the fact that they own up to a mistake. Secondly, we still remember Apple banning a certain Camera app for enabling this function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just so you know, you can also use the headset volume up key as a camera remote release shutter. It's a small thing, but it might be useful if you're seriously into iPhone photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing we found that Apple didn't give enough credit in their elaborate presentation is that a swipe to the right on the camera viewfinder opens the last picture taken. A swipe to the left in turn brings back the camera's live view instantly. Perhaps the reason for laying low on this one is it?s an honest rip-off from the Windows Phone 7 camera app. Still, it?s one neat feature and we love it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia changes - separate Video app, Music app replaces iPod, integrated photo editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 5 has finally given the iPhone a dedicated Video app and removed the video section from the iPod player. The Video app is the same as on the iPad. As of iOS 5, you are now able to sync and play 1080p videos to the default video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the iPod player, this is no longer its name. The music player is now simply called Music and has a new icon. As it no longer handles video, the renaming makes sense. There are no other changes - visual or functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has a new nifty feature - a photo editor. It enables rotation, cropping, and red-eye removal. There's also an option called Enhance over which you have no control - it's all automatic. In Edit mode four keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reminders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has included a brand new app with the new iOS 5 - Reminders. It?s as simple as it name suggests it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders app has pretty simple interface doing really some basic but important stuff. There are two viewing options - by date or a list. Both of them start with a Completed list as a first pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the List view you have the option to add different lists - the default one is the events on your phone. But you can add list for iCloud or Gmail reminders for example. All lists appear as different panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have chosen the List view, you have to work with only 2 panes - the Completed list and one pane for all of your reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing by date gives you lots of panes - you start with Completed and then you have one pane for each day. You also get a Calendar shortcut, where you can choose easily the day you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you choose to create a new reminder, first you must type its name directly on the pane and click Done. After that you are able to edit (just tap on it) - you can choose the Type of reminder - by date or location, Due option, Priority and to which list it will belong (iPhone, iCloud, Gmail etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to be reminded on the day of the event, you just choose date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novel feature is the location-aware reminder triggering option. You can choose a location from your phonebook or your current location (why not Gmaps, it beats us!) and then you choose whether you like the reminder to activate on on arrival or departure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a reminder activates, you see it as a standard notification - on your lockscreen, the Notification Center and the homescreen (as a banner or a pop-up).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Safari and Safari Reader<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has updated the Safari browser too, both the iPhone/iPod Touch and the iPad's. It promises better performance but we can't say it's that much better than the iOS 4.3x Safari. We ran the SunSpider benchmark and the Safari in iOS 5 scored about 3500ms, about 700ms less than iOS 4.3 Safari and about 4500 less than iOS 4.2 browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few new handy features - Tabbed Browsing for the iPad, a Private Browsing option for all iOS devices and the Reader mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPads are finally getting tabs in the browser. It was a long awaited feature that took Apple three iterations of iOS to implement. Still, better late than never, we guess. It works as it's supposed to and you no longer need to go through the Pages View to jump on another already opened page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All iGadgets have a Private Browsing option in the Safari settings (Settings-&gt;Safari). If you turn it on, nothing you do on the bowser will leave a trail in your phone - no browsing history, no search history, no usernames or passwords, etc. The only thing nicer than the Private Browsing itself would have been if this was implemented as a dedicated key within the Safari's UI, instead of a lonely toggle in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the advanced settings you can find very detailed web browsing data and delete all of it or some specific site-related data only (such as Google Search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now let's talk about the best part so far - the integrated Reader. If a page is compatible with the Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get the new Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. If you activate it, you'll get a clean view of the article you are reading - only text and the article-related pictures. There are no ads, no navigation controls, nothing beyond the important stuff. And best of all, getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you get to the end of the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two font controls at the top. You can also select a word and choose Define - the iOS 5 integrated Dictionary will open with the meaning of the word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open a multi-page article (like this review) the Reader will detect it and will load the next page when you reach the bottom of the current.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also make bookmarks of Reader pages - they are added into the Reader List for later reading. Note that the page is not saved for offline access, it's just a bookmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video for you to enjoy:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Storage management and App Store purchase list<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next two features became favorites of those of you who use 8/16GB iPhones - Storage management and Purchased list within the App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find the Purchased list in App Store's section Updates. It has two tabs - All and Not On This iPhone. It's the easiest way to download again an app you've purchased before and later deleted it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this list is available on the iOS 4 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the Storage Management. You can find it in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Usage menu. Here you now have storage information too, before the Battery Percentage toggle and the statistics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storage part begins with Free and Used space info and then you have a list with your ten biggest apps and their memory footprint - usually the Music and some heavy games such as Infinity Blade. You can access all of yours installed app via the dedicated button at the end of the top 10 list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you tap on an app from this list you will be to see its data footprint (default app, saves, etc.) but the clean data option is now gone (it was available in the beta versions). You can still uninstall the whole app from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those of you which are always troubled by low memory storage, those options should be quite helpful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wireless activation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps this is the part Apple put most effort in. Many are probably put off by the dependence on iTunes. Well, Apple has finally made this a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer to activate your iGadget. The moment you turn on your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch for the first time, you can do the activation and setup process right from your device (a network connection is required of course). After a few simple steps, quite similar to Android's initiation process, you are good to go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OTA updates<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer connection and iTunes to install new firmware updates either. Now you can do it over-the-air. The option is in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Software Update. Of course, you can still use iTunes on your Mac/PC to do that if your Wi-Fi connection is too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And thanks to the use of Delta encoding, the updates will now come with a much smaller footprint than before when they carried a whole system image. The new update files carry only the bits that need changing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The OTA updates</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi iTunes sync<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case you choose to rely on the traditional computer dependent iTunes sync, you will be happy to know Apple has now provided an option to sync wirelessly. The only requirements are your iGadget and your PC/Mac are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and you have previously enabled the Wi-Fi sync option in your iTunes client with your iGadget connected with a cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The the wireless wync runs automatically as soon as you plug your device to charge and you open the iTunes client on your Wi-Fi connected computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new about the PC/Mac iTunes sync, is that it no longer locks your device during the process. You can continue to use your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch during the sync process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the connectivity has been vastly improved. If you choose to use the iCloud, the only one thing that you may ever need the desktop iTunes is for using the USB mass storage functionality. We hope someday Apple does this more natural.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accessibility gets better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has added a few new accessibility options that may be helpful even for those who are not actualy disabled. The iPhone may now use the LED flash for alerts and you can assign and even create custom vibration patterns to specific alert events or contacts ? much like you would assign a personalized ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistive Touch is also a useful accessibility feature. By activating it you get a new on-screen key that stays available throughout the UI, even on the lockscreen and in games. It?s shaped as a homescreen icon and offers a few useful menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily move the key in one of the four corners of the screen at any time. Tapping on it reveals four shortcuts ? Gestures, Device, Home, Favorites. Every shortcut, except the Home key, opens another submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gestures shortuct allows you to simulate two, three, four or five-finger tap. The Device shortcut will allows you to rotate the screen (if available), lock the screen, manipulate volume controls and even simulate a device shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Favorites section you have Pinch gesture shortcut and you can additionally assign six more custom gestures. You just need to perform them once so the iOS can save them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home virtual key has the same functionality as the hardware Home ? you can single/double/triple tap it to get what you need from the iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistive Touch is a pure accessibility option that helps you control everything in the iOS with let?s say just one finger. It?s certainly more usable on the iPad because on the large screen the dot doesn?t get in the way as much as it does on the iPhone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, let's pay due attention to the iCloud. What is it, how you set it up and what you get?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud is Apple's cloud-based content management - the service, which comes free with iOS 5 will further reduce the need of a PC/Mac and iTunes. Effortless syncing and backup/restore - along with pushing content to all devices associated with your Apple ID.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and iCloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Until now you synced all your apps with a single computer and its iTunes. If you had more than one iDevice you've done two (or more) separate sync processes. Well, this is no more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the new Purchased list already in the App Store's Update tab. Now Apple knows exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple knows this for each one of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 1.5MB. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural process to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then the whole content will backed up (have that in mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature from the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud syncs everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iCloud is capable of syncing all your contacts, calendar events, books, photos and documents. The content will become available on all your iDevices automagically. The iCloud stores new photos automatically for 30 days, enough time to connect your other iGadgets so they can get the photos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud offers free email at @me.com<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iCloud offers free me.com email that will also sync automatically across all your iDevices. You will be offered this when you activate the iCloud for the first time and the setup process is done in one easy step.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iTunes Match<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own (ripped music, etc.) that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Well, Apple is now offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased from iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets - it will sync the same way the other content syncs. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection and sees if your songs match to songs in the Apple's iTunes Store (currently 18+ million songs and growing). If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on its servers for further sync. Pretty cool, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the iTunes scans yours songs and push them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your songs are with lower quality than 256Kbps, the iTunes will download the song with better quality (256Kbps). The iMatch service costs $25 per year and seems unique in the music store world. It will become available soon for the US users and later in more countries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud Backup and iCloud Restore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can back up your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch with the iCloud. It will store all of your settings and other important stuff, so if you need to restore wirelessly (if you got a new device for example) - it's the easiest way. The backup is automatic and is done every time your device is charging, locked and connected to a Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can restore your iGadget from iCloud, but first you need to connect it through iTunes, perform a standard restore procedure (downloading and reinstalling the iOS) and then chose the iCloud restore option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5GB free storage, up to 55GB with a paid subscription<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple gives you 5GB free storage for iCloud sync. Now this may sound not enough for you, but actually it's more than enough. Your purchased music, apps and books don't count in this storage (except the app's personal data such as saves, settings, etc.). So the things that eat that storage are app's data, contacts, mail, photos, calendar events, backups and personal documents. Of course, there is an option to buy more iCloud storage - you can get 10GB additional storage (to those 5GB) for ?16 per year, 20GB more costs ?32/year or you could opt for 50GB additional storage to your free 5GB for ?80 per year. Refunds are available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Find My Friends app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The app Find My Friends, that was announced a week ago at the Let's Talk iPhone event, has also become available into the Apple App Store. It is free and compatible with both the iOS for iPhone/iPod and iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app allows you to share your current location always with trusted friends or temporary with not-so-trusted ones. It works both ways - you can see your friends' location too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app offers a few options - to see your friend on the map and get directions to that place (redirecting you to the Maps app though). The Find My Friends app interface also shows you the distance between you and your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to hide your location when needed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 5 on the iPad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iOS 5 is also available for the iPad family. The fifth version brings everything we already saw in the iPhone 4 - the Notification Center, the Reminders, the Newsstand, the iCloud integration, the new iMessage service, the social integration with Twitter, the new Safari with the Reader, as well as minor (but important) tweaks on the Calendar, Mail and the Camera apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you could expect the iOS 5 interface on the iPad looks a bit different, but everything works the same way as on the iPhone/iPod Touch version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Notification Center and the pop-up notifications look on the iPad:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the iPad's Reminders interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Newsstand is also onboard. It looks and works exactly the same as on the iPhone - it stores automatically your Magazine apps and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad family is also compatible with all the iCloud services - sync, backup and restore. The iCloud settings are the same as the iPhone's and you also start with 5GB free cloud storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages app is the same as the iPhone's, it just uses the two-column UI. The iPads now support iMessages, so you can chat freely with your iOS buddies given you have some sort of a network connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter integration has also made it on the iPads. To get started with it, you need to install the free Twitter app first (there is a shortcut in the Settings). Then you can start tweeting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Safari browser now offers tabs in addition to the Reader functionality. The Dictionary works fine as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about those minor tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is the yearly view in the Calendar:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app also got various options as Mark as Read/Unread; Bold, Italic and Underline text formatting; and Quote level. Dictionary works here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera app also offers swipe to show the latest picture - the same feature we first saw in the Windows Phone 7 OS. We guess, that?s the reason why Apple didn't advertise it at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An iOS 5 running iPad can now be activated wirelessly too. It also supports Wi-Fi iTunes sync and Over-The-Air software updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad family also got an updated keyboard - it can now be split in two for easier typing while you're holding the device in the same time. Just pinch zoom in on the keyboard or swipe simultaneously with your two fingers in the opposite directions over the keyboard itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multi-tasking gestures are reserved for the iPad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much has been said about the iOS multi-touch gestures since the first iOS 4.3 beta came out. Basically, their purpose is to help you navigate through the UI without using the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between the active apps using horizontal four (or five)-finger swipes. A similar upward swipe will bring you the task switcher. There's a four (or five if it feels more natural) finger pinch zoom out. It will bring you to the homescreen, sending the app to the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those gestures are only available in the iPad's version of the iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zoom out and the horizontal swipes work everywhere but the homescreen, while the swipe up gesture is available across the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video demo of how they work on an iPad 2 running the just released iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four fingers are just too much on the 3.5-inch iPhone screen - in case you wonder why those gestures are available only on the iPad. It would have been nice of Apple to have included them as an option anyway.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there isn't much left to ask of the iOS. The fifth version brings the platform up to speed and the iPhone 4S promises to push its limits even further with the Siri intelligent assistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, there are still lots of things missing - like Flash support, proper USB storage management, wider codec support and more. But most of the missing features go against the Apple doctrine, so we are probably never going to see them implemented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it right now, the future of the iOS is about novel native apps such as the upcoming Siri assistant, rather than integrating mainstream features. It seems the iOS core is almost complete, so it?s probably time for Apple to concentrate on making cool new apps and value-adding services - social, business, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 5 is as good as any of the previous iOS updates - bringing just enough new features to be evolutionary, but not revolutionary. It's the same straightforward mobile OS we saw on the first iPhone, it's just becoming more complete. There are many people loving and hating the Apple way of handling things, but it's still the winning way on the current market - because it?s simple, it works as promised and offers the biggest mobile application store to date. The iOS has always been an app-centric rather than a feature-rich platform - exactly the thing that sets it apart, and puts it ahead of rivals.</paragraph>
