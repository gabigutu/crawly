			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Feature phones have been busy adding more features to their arsenal in a bid to survive the onslaught of cheap smartphones. The Samsung S3850 Corby II is one such phone. Corby put a bargain price on touchscreen ? the Corby II moves up a notch but stays within budget.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, multitasking, app store ? those things used to be associated with smartphones, but the Corby II has them all on its list of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest TouchWiz, fresh from recent stints with both Bada and Android, blurs the line with smartphones. In fact, the major difference between the Corby II and a low-end Bada phone is that you install Java apps on it, instead of Bada apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The J2ME platform has been around longer and many useful apps have been developed for it, while Bada OS is relatively new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Samsung S3850 Corby II can?t run away from its name. The bigger screen and better specs aside, the Corby II is for beginners. So, no high-end features, thank you very much.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S3850 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Some might not be happy with the cutbacks ? but the lack of 3G connectivity is offset by the Wi-Fi support, while the low camera resolution is not a showstopper. The social networking support is a key feature ? some people just can?t do without Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung must be getting better at building cheap phones ? the Corby II feels extraordinarily solid despite its all-plastic body. With DNSe and a good-sized microSD card you can skip the dedicated music player, the Corby II will handle your musical needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color combo and the software package make the Samsung S3850 Corby II a youth oriented phone ? suited to their means and interests. Read on if you think it?s right for you. See you after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S3850 Corby II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II measures 109.9 x 66.6 x 11.7 mm and weighs 102g. It?s a medium sized handset, though it?s a tad wider than most. That?s not unusual for phones with a 4:3 screen though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A descendant of the Corby, the Samsung S3850 Corby II has curvy lines and bright colors to break away from the monotony line of black touch candybars. Everything?s centered around the display ? which is decently sized at 3.2? ? as opposed to the 2.8 incher on the original Corby ? but the resolution won?t win any awards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2? QVGA capacitive touchscreen is bright but the colors are a bit dull and the viewing angles are very limited. Sunlight legibility is not the display?s redeeming quality either, the coating is just too reflective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s not much going on above and below the display. The earpiece is alone on top, with no ambient light or proximity sensors around. Below the display, there are three hardware keys ? the two receiver keys on the sides of a big menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are big and easy to hit, with a good click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the Corby II houses the Power/Lock key and the microSD card slot (cards of up to 16GB are supported). The card slot is covered by a plastic flap. There?s no hardware camera shutter key ? you?ll have to make do with the virtual one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, there?s the lanyard eyelet and the volume rocker. The rocker is rather thin but fairly usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are found on top of the Corby II. The microUSB port is covered while the audio jack is exposed. The bottom of the phone has just the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Samsung S3850 Corby II is the home of the 2MP fixed-focus camera lens and the loudspeaker grill right next to it. The curve of the back keeps the camera a millimeter away from the surface but that?s all the protection against scratches it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This curve also keeps the loudspeaker from getting muffled when placed on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3850 Corby II comes in bold colors ? our test unit came in yellow, which was quite the attention grabber. The dimples on the back do little to improve the grip but are nice to touch and more appealing than plain smooth plastic. Fingerprints are all but invisible there too. The Corby II will probably have no Fashion Jackets, which were a key feature of the original Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel uncovers the 1000mAh battery and the SIM compartment. The official numbers put the battery life at 9 hours and 30 minutes of talk time and just under 26 days of standby. The unit didn?t feel finalized so we?ll have to put the battery test off until the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 is a fairly compact phone ? thin, light and pocketable ? but its screen aspect ratio makes it wide. It?s not uncomfortable to hold, but narrower phones sit better in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though it?s plastic all over, the S3850 Corby II feels solidly built and exhibited no creaks. The controls are well positioned and easily reachable as are all points on the touchscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? feature phone TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve already met the latest TouchWiz for feature phones with our Samsung Star II review and now it?s time for another round.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II enjoys many of the usability-enhancing features of the Bada OS and, unless you?re an app predator, you won?t miss a smartphone OS very often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won?t have access to the rich Android Market or even Bada?s apps store, but there?s still a good selection of Java apps (Opera Mini, Google Maps, even an official Facebook app) and even games. Samsung Apps will come in handy here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz homescreen is widget-based and you can place around as many widgets as you can fit. When you run out of space, you can add new homescreens and easily rearrange the old ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Widget button lets you pull out more widgets (or put some away) from the tray at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put as many widgets as you can fit on the homescreen and they can?t overlap. If there isn't enough room on the current homescreen, it will automatically scroll to an empty one when you pull out a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 9 widgets preinstalled but you can download more from the Samsung Apps store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there are three virtual buttons ? Keypad, Contacts and Messages, which are visible both on the homescreen and in the menu. They can?t be changed unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to five), which are sweep-scrollable sideways. Only native apps can be put in the menu ? you can?t put a shortcut to your favorite Java app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each page in the main menu is a 3 x 3 grid of shortcuts. The buttons are big and easily thumbable. This time Samsung has gone for a simple two-color design instead of their usual colorful set of icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts can be rearranged or you can get them sorted automatically based on how frequently you use them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some shortcuts in the main menu also show a number in their top right corner ? like number of missed calls, unread emails and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3850 Corby II features multitasking complete with a task manager. As usual, you press and hold the menu key to bring up the task manager and you can switch between apps (both native and Java) and kill apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To minimize an app, you hit the menu key. The red key works a little inconsistently ? it exits some app but brings up a dialog for others (which offers to exit the app, go back to the app or minimize it). Maybe when the software is finalized, the whole thing will become more consistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Android-inspired feature is the panel on the top of the screen ? you open and close it with taps (no dragging) and from there you can toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and silent mode on or off ? just as on the Samsung Star II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player and radio controls also appear there when the respective app is active. This way the playback controls let you control the playback from almost anywhere (the panel is accessible from anywhere but Java apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Corby II lock screen is the typical Samsung ?sweep to unlock? variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you have a missed call, the lock screen displays a piece of jigsaw, which you need to put in place to unlock the phone and open the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing you?re likely to see on the lock screen is the CD icon on top. It appears when the music player (or radio) is on or it?s paused and shows the track info along with the skip and play/pause buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II packs an accelerometer, which does the two usual tricks ? screen rotation and turn to mute ? but there?s a handy shortcut with it too. A double tap anywhere can launch one of the phone apps ? browser, contacts, music player, or anything else from the main menu really.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Gallery is built into the file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file browser on the Samsung S3850 Corby II serves as the Gallery too. You?ll want to switch to the thumbnail view, which is better for browsing photos, but if you need to manage files, then the list view is the better option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no pinch zooming despite the fact the Corby II has a capacitive display. Instead, you have the one-finger zoom, which kicks in after you touch the image with your thumb for a second or two. A minimap in the top left corner will help you navigate once you zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available and the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks with DNSe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II comes with good music credentials to make carrying a dedicated music player unnecessary. There?s a standard 3.5mm audio jack and DNSe technology plus a microSD card slot for storing your music collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background and can be controlled from the notification area or the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Corby II equalizer offers the standard presets: pop, jazz, classic, stereo widening, dynamic and surround effects. You can?t create custom equalizers, but with such a rich selection of presets you really won?t need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DNSe sound enhancing technology offers Externalization, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Mega bass, Wide and Concert hall presets for an even better sonic experience. There?s also a virtual 5.1 channel mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify music playing from somewhere else, e.g. at the café, by sampling about 10 seconds from it and looking it up online. There?s also a Find similar, which looks for similar songs to the one you?re currently playing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio has RDS, can record too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II features an FM radio with RDS. The broadcast recording option is present, which can be a cheap way to get tracks or whole music sets off the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still need to plug a pair of headphones to serve as an FM radio antenna to get reception unlike the Samsung Champ, for instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic browser, connectivity pivots on Wi-Fi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II is generally unimpressive, but it?s above the average for the price bracket. The inclusion of Wi-Fi helps a lot ? a phone in this price range doesn?t usually come with a decent data plan. The Corby II isn?t 3G-enabled, so EDGE will have to do while you?re out of range of Wi-Fi hotspots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II?s web browser looks very much like its Bada OS sibling but it doesn?t offer much functionality. The browser supports kinetic scrolling and one-finger zoom. This about completes the list of browser features ? there?s no text reflow or Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are bookmarks too along with history list and a list of most visited sites (displayed as thumbnails). There is autosuggestion for the URL bar, which means you won?t have to type much on the uncomfortable keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has enough surface area but the low QVGA resolution gets in the way of comfortable browsing ? text is as good as illegible at low zoom levels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung usually put office document viewers on their feature phones, which gives them an edge against the competition. The Samsung S3850 Corby II is no exception as it packs the Picsel viewer, but there?s always the question of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Corby II surprised us pleasantly with fast zoom and pan speeds. There?s an auto-reflow option, which reformats the document at each zoom level for better viewing on the small screen. Search is also available if you need to quickly locate something in the doc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Office docs are not strictly business ? PDFs are a common format for manuals and such, .DOCs can be used for notes and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 Corby II borrows the UI of the big players and hopes its charm and preloaded apps will win over users. The package is quite rich out of the box - messaging, SNS integration, documents and so on will handle most people?s day-to-day needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, before you buy the S3850 Corby II you have to pass a crossroad ? smartphone or not? The Samsung Galaxy Mini S5570 is a spitting image of the Corby II but there?s an Android heart inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes down to price versus needs. The Samsung S3850 will handle Exchange accounts, view documents, do Facebook and Twitter and so on ? Android?s versatility is only worth it if you need apps beyond the preloaded ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3850 is a well-built phone with a good level of functionality. It won?t beat any smartphone but it?s not competing with them either. It?s in the segment of affordable touch phones and those have enjoyed high popularity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Older phones in the segment can?t compete ? their prices may have plummeted, but Wi-Fi connectivity and the Corby II?s new UI make most of them look yesterday?s stuff.</paragraph>
