			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year the CES expo in Las Vegas is mostly about HDR TVs and smart appliances (fridges, washing machines) rather than smartphones and slates. LG is among the few manufacturers to bring new mobile gadgets - the LG K10 and LG K7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K series is the successor of the popular L series, which reached third generation last year and became pretty hard to differentiate. So we applaud LG for the decision to build a new lineup instead of piling up messy model numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K10 and K7 are textbook mid-gangers, though both have borrowed some of the features of the premium G- and V-series devices, mostly on the exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both LG K10 and K7 run on Android Lollipop (no Marshmallow), but hopefully LG has some update plans in store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG K10 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG K10 is the bigger of the two new mid-rangers from the South Korean manufacturer. It is built around a 5.3" IPS 720p display and runs on a 64-bit processor with a varying amount of RAM - 1GB/1.5GB/2GB, depending on the market of distribution. The battery has a capacity of 2,300 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the preceding L models, the K10's main camera megapixel count and internal storage will also vary by market and carrier. LG will be offering K10 with 8 or 16 GB of expandable storage while the camera will be either 8MP or 13MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if that's not confusion for you just yet, the K10 will get three different CPU variants depending on the connectivity suite - the LTE model will be available with either an octa-core 1.14 GHz or a quad-core 1.2GHz processor. And the LTE model with the quad-core CPU may even be found ticking at 1.3GHz on some markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the specs of the 3G model of the K10 are fixed - it has a quad-core 1.3GHz processor and 8MP camera only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG K10 utilizes the G series signature design with the iconic rear control deck below the main camera. This configuration has already proven very comfy and allows for additional gestures and functions, otherwise rather impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is nicely textured though the white flavor is glossy and gets smudged in fingerprints in no time. But then again, LG markets the K10 as having a 'new glossy pebble design language' so this is actually intentional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has designed a special flip case, somewhat similar to the Samsung's S-View and LG QuickWindow cases. Instead of a small window, though, the new case gives you an entire strip along the right side of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visible strip of the screen is also protected by a transparent extension from the main case and it can display relevant information such as the clock, date, and missed events, among others. You can even answer calls, no need of flipping the front cover. The K10 doesn't have an AMOLED screen, we guess the info strip won't be an always-on feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG K10 model for the US market will pack an 8MP main camera while the Korean one is getting the 13MP snapper. Both models will offer 5MP selfie snappers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detailed pricing and availability are yet to be announced, but the phone should become available before Q1 2016 runs out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG K7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG K7 isn't as complicated as its K10 sibling. It's a 5" smartphone with similar design relying on a rear control deck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K7 offers a FWVGA IPS display (480x854px) and will be available in two models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE flavor of the K7 runs on a quad-core 1.1GHz processor while the 3G flavor will have a quad-core CPU ticking at 1.3GHz. The models with 8GB storage will be packing 1GB of RAM while those with 16GB internal memory are complimented with 1.5GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the main camera of the K7 will be 8MP or 5MP, depending on the market and carrier. The selfie snapper is fixed at 5MP as is the 2,125 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG K7 has a clean matte back, unlike the textured glossy one on the LG K10. It was the better one to handle, partly due to the lack of all that glossiness, and also because of the more compact size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K7 didn't have any special flip case at CES, but maybe LG will be selling cases similar to the K10's later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the US, the LG K7 will be sold as LG Tribute 5 on Boost Mobile. Once again - pricing and availability are yet to be detailed, but the phone is expected to hit the shelves in Q1 this year.</paragraph>
