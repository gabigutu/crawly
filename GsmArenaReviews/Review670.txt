			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Proper flagships are coming in pairs lately as every maker is trying to cater for different crowds. Apple, Samsung, HTC and Sony - but also Oppo, Meizu, Huawei. Until recently the breakdown would've implied ones to watch and learn from vs. ones to compete with but the market is changing. Up and coming Chinese makers have really hit a stride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi here has done a fair deal of watching and learning, and still haven't entirely outgrown the copycat phase. Yet they do have not one, but two flagship phablets that seem capable of challenging the big guys. Today we meet the Mi Note, the first of the two to make it to the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Mi Note Pro, which uses all the latest tech such as a QHD display and the controversial Snapdragon 810 chip, the Mi Note is still one foot in 2014 with a 5.7" 1080p screen and Snapdragon 801. But don't be mistaken - Xiaomi has spared no effort in making the Mi Note a looker, enhancing its camera department and polishing its MIUI 6 launcher. The moment you grab a Mi Note - you'll know you are handling something new and special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the highlights of the smartphone are the 13MP rear camera with optical stabilization and 4K video recording, as well as the promising front 4MP UltraPixel selfie sharpshooter. Other things of interest include dual-SIM support, 4G LTE and a 3,000mAh battery. Once you are past the nice metal frame and you've had enough exploring the rear curved glass, you'll be greeted with the new flattened MIUI 6 software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our hopes that Xiaomi would eventually consider microSD card slots on its flagships were left unanswered. The Mi 3 and Mi 4 didn't pack a memory slot either, so it isn't much of a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 801 chip doesn't support an FM radio by default and requires extra chips to do so - Xiaomi chose not to bother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the unibody build doesn't allow for a removable battery and this will be a red flag to some, though hardly a dealbreaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen many manufacturers moving to various unibody designs at the expense of having a non-removable battery and we can't say we're that disappointed. The lack of a microSD slot is an entirely different thing though - plenty of room for one in a phablet after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know you are all eager to see the Mi Note in action, so we are done introducing it. Our traditional hardware checkup kicks off right after the jump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xiaomi Mi Note<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box is no different from the packaging of recent Xiaomi phones. Boxes are all made out of recycled paper and look quite pleasantly simple. As for the Mi Note's accessories, there is nothing out of the usual: an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you order the Xiaomi Mi Note at XiaomiShop.com, you'll also get a flip leather case, a glass screen protector, a USB OTG adapter and a touch pen at no extra cost.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Mi Note 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note measures 155 x 77.6 x 7mm and weighs about 161g. The device is curved at the back and actually appears even slimmer. The Xiaomi Mi Note is pretty much as big as the 5.7" Galaxy Note 4, but thinner and lighter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi seems to like the Mi 4 design and its reception, so the company decided to enhance it further and apply it on the Mi Note. Scaling to phablet size has even worked in the Mi Note's favor. The front seems pleasantly familiar with the thin screen bezels and the Mi logo in the top right corner. The frame is once again cast out of metal, while the rear panel is all glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.7" display is covered by a piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, with the so-called 2.5D effect along the edges. The curve at the rear is more prominent and you'll definitely feel it in your hand. The carefully curved edges make the Xiaomi Mi Note look a lot thinner than it actually is, beautiful. Somewhat like a Galaxy Note Edge, but reversed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side frame is all metal, just like on the Xiaomi Mi 4. It really stands out this time because it gets even thinner along its taller sides. The Mi Note might look like a regular smartphone up front, but its back is what makes a really special. Actually, even though it's button-less (capacitive only), the front is more than distantly reminiscent of Samsung's Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Xiaomi Mi Note looks great, its handling is far from perfect. The phablet is solidly built and all pieces tie together well, all curved details almost completely compromise the grip. Handling the Mi Note, even though pleasant to touch, is far from secure - a device so slippery must be handled with extreme caution at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slippery back opens the Mi Note to an even bigger issue - the device must always rest on perfectly level surfaces, or it simply risks gliding off. It is one of the most slippery devices we've had around in a long time and we were extra careful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note's controls are pretty much the same as what we found on its Mi 4 predecessor. Almost the entire front is occupied by the 5.7" IPS screens with impressively thin bezels. Above the screen we find the earpiece, with a couple of sensors and the 4MP UltraPixel (sadly fixed-focus) selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi is sticking with the capacitive controls instead of wasting precious screen real estate. The trio has been updated with the new mandatory arrangement required by Google - Task Switcher, Home and Back key. A longer press on the Task Switcher key will bring any contextual menu though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top of the Mi Note as is the secondary noise-cancellation microphone, used in both calls and stereo audio recording when shooting videos. The bottom has the massive loudspeaker grille, which also houses the primary microphone, and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ejectable SIM tray is alone on the left side. It supports one micro-SIM card and one nano-SIM. It's interesting how Xiaomi accommodated such a big tray for the SIM cards, but couldn't find a place to put a microSD slot. We like Huawei's and Oppo's approach, where you can choose what to use the second slot for: a microSD or a nano-SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note's right is where the volume rocker and the power/lock key are. Both are thin, made of metal and provide excellent tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note's rear features the 13MP camera lens, which uses the latest generation of Sony sensors. There's a dual-tone dual-LED flash as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note features a 5.7" Full HD IPS display, while its Pro sibling will flaunt QHD resolution on the same diagonal. The Mi Note's display has 386ppi, which is sharp enough never mind the 500ppi has already been crossed. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with curved 2.5D edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look reveals a standard RGB arrangement of the sub-pixels in the Xiaomi Mi Note LCD panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Xiaomi Mi Note has a higher maximum brightness level compared to the Xiaomi Mi 4's, while retaining the same good contrast and colors. At 100% brightness the black luminance is among the lowest we've seen, while the whites are almost on par with the Mi 4's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note has a rather reflective screen, and the resulting sunlight contrast ratio is only average. Nevertheless, the 1080p display is reasonably legible in direct sunlight, even if doing so isn't the most comfortable experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The high-sensitivity mode for use with gloves is available here much like on the Mi 4, but you probably shouldn't leave that turned on if you don't need it, because it's known to drain the battery faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a way to prevent accidental screen unlocks, while the phone is in your pocket. If enabled, you won't be able to unlock the screen while something is covering the proximity sensor. Again, that would probably take its toll on the battery life.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of, Xiaomi has put a 3,000mAh battery inside the Mi Note, a solid enough unit for a 5.7" device. We ran our battery test with one SIM and two SIM cards active. The single-SIM Xiaomi Mi Note scored a 56h rating, which means you can count 2 full days and then some if you do an hour each of calling, browsing the web and video playback a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are to use two SIM cards, the standby time is halved and, along with it, the overall rating goes a little south to 48 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note comes loaded with wireless connectivity features. There's Cat.4 LTE (up to 150Mpbs of download speeds, 50Mbps of upload), and there is regular 2G and 3G connectivity, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Note is a dual-SIM phone with dual standby. One of the cards can be connected to an LTE or 3G network, while the other will work on GSM only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes (dual-band) Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and Wi-Fi Hotspot capabilities. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1 LE, but no ANT+ or NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Note relies on a standard microUSB 2.0 port for charging and wired data connectivity. What we do miss here is a wired TV-out option either via MHL or SlimPort. USB on-the-go and USB Hub are supported, which means you can external storage and peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is also support for GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou. Unfortunately there is no FM radio as the Snapdragon 801 doesn't come with FM support by default and Xiaomi didn't add it later either.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat skinned with company's latest MIUI v6 launcher. The MIUI ROMs have been around for a while and are fairly popular among the Android community. Xiaomi's customizations run very deep and replace everything including all Google services. The Mi phones sold in China don't have access to Google's services and those need to be sideloaded one way or the other (some resellers may even do that for you). The models sold directly by Xiaomi on official markets outside of China come with the entire Google package pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi MIUI v6 completely overhauls the user interface, though it keeps the same layout and operational logic. Xiaomi has put a huge effort to make the UI flat and simplistic as possible and yet keep the entire functionality intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into details, here's quick walkthrough of the Mi Note on video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen here has a clock in the top left corner. Gone are the lockscreen widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to unlock is to swipe upwards. If you want a quick access to the camera - just swipe from the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom by default, but you can dock up to five items. You can have any app there or even folders with multiple items if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer - anything you install pops up on your homescreen, which can have unlimited panes. There're no shortcuts and the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will uninstall the corresponding app. There is a pop-up for confirming the action though, so you can't accidentally uninstall apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen widgets are available, too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. There are few options available, but of course, you can get even more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen effects are available and you can change themes, too. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile (you can disable changing the sound profile from settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two semi-transparent tabs - the first one hosts all notifications, while the second one (swipe left to access) offers non-customizable quick toggles and a Settings shortcut. Unfortunately, you can't bring the toggles page with two-finger swipe from the top as it is with other Android devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi provides its own cloud service for content syncing between devices. Each Mi Cloud account is granted 5GB of free storage. You can use it to backup contacts, messages, your entire gallery, call log, notes, settings, voice recordings, Browser content (history, tabs, webapp data) and your music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds familiar? Yes, indeed! Xiaomi's sync and backup service shares lots of similarities with the Apple iCloud. There is even a free Cloud Messaging option that allows Xiaomi users to exchange messages over the internet connection instead of being billed for SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you signed in with your Mi Cloud account, you can opt for the Find device function - a handy feature in case you misplace your Xiaomi Mi Note or someone steals it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi preinstalls Google Now only on its phones outside China, when they prepare them for international markets. At the time of writing this review the Mi Note is only officially available in China, so all units you may come across lack Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did get our review unit with pre-installed Google Play Store plus Google sync for app data, contacts, and browser data but perhaps they've been sideloaded by the reseller providing this review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can sideload them yourself one way or the other if they don't come pre-installed on your unit. And once you have those, you can easily download all other Google apps such as Google Now straight from the Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note utilizes the widely-used Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, which was the chipset of choice for the 2014 flagship tier. So, the Mi Note utilizes a quad-core Krait 400 processor clocked at 2.5GHz, Adreno 330 GPU ticking at 578MHz and 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note packs a 1080p display, unlike its Pro sibling, which has a QHD display and the more recent Snapdragon 810 chip. This should give it an edge in the graphics department over the QHD-enabled LG G3 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we kick off our benchmark routine with the GeekBench 3 app, which tests the multi-core processor performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the four Kraits 450 cores within the Xiaomi Mi Note scores similar to every other Snapdragon 801 smartphone we've tested. The octa-core processors powering the Meizu MX4 and the LG G Flex 2 do better, of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 5 - a compound test taking in consideration CPU, GPU and RAM performance suggests pretty much the same as the GeekBench 3 - Xiaomi Mi Note is on par with its S801 siblings and not that far from the more powerful Galaxy Note 4, Meizu MX4 and LG G Flex2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark OS II 2.0 test, which adds web browsing and OS system performance to the equation, turned out quite surprising results. The overall score of the Xiaomi Mi Note is bested only by the S810-powered LG G Flex2, while all other competitors outputted a lower score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor single-core performance also came out impressive, beaten only by the 2.7GHz Krait 450 CPU of the Galaxy Note 4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core performance of the Krait 400 processor is equal to most of the Snapdragon 801 devices but was oddly outran by other S801 devices such as the HTC One (M8) and the Motorola Moto X (2014).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note uses an Adreno 330 graphic accelerator, with the highest available CPU clock among the Snapdragon 801 gang.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X cross-platform GPU benchmark put the Xiaomi Mi Note a hair better than the rest of its S801 siblings. The Adreno 420 (Galaxy Note 4) and Adreno 430 (G Flex2) did noticeably better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offscreen tests of the GFX benchmark present the same result as the BaseMark X. All Adreno 330-powered devices fare the same, bested only by the Adreno 420 (Note 4), Adreno 430 (Flex2) and PowerVR G6450 (iPhone 6 Plus).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The onscreen GFX tests are different because of the higher resolution displays on the Galaxy Note 4 and LG G3. Yet the Xiaomi Mi Note does very well, close to the other Snapdragon 801 smartphones and the same as the Galaxy Note 4. This means - whatever the game or app - you'll be getting flagship performance for sure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mi Browser in the Xiaomi Mi Note turned out quite capable when it comes to JavaScript performance, but the BrowserMark 2.1 test revealed its overall performance is below average. In case you are not happy with the default browser, you can always install Google Chrome. It posted very respectable scores on both tests and does an excellent job indeed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note provides flagship performance and currently there is no task it can't handle with ease. The MIUI 6 launcher is amazingly light, fast and smooth. The only letdown may be the lack of 64-bit support, but it could be years before it actually becomes relevant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts. The app has been updated with the new flat looks, but everything else is the same. The app uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing and works great - it's looking up both names and phone numbers so you always find what you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note supports voice call recording and it can do it automatically on each call if you like. You can also assign an answer gesture, pre-define quick responses upon reject, there is even support for internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more call settings if you dig deeper into the menu - flip to mute the ringer, turn on/off the proximity sensor, lock automatically once slipped in a pocket, it can even mute calls from unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note scored an Excellent mark on our loudspeaker tests, meaning you'll never miss any calls and notifications. The loudspeaker sound quality seems great and Xiaomi has definitely improved its work since the Redmi Mi 3 and Mi 4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized in threads, with New Message and Search keys at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will automatically turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Gmail app pre-installed, but you can opt for Gmail or Inbox, if you prefer, from the Play Store. There generic Mail app is capable of handling all kind of mail accounts, including Gmail, and it can handle multiple Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI offers Google keyboard by default - it has always been pleasure to use and is one of the most preferred Android keyboards out there. On this screen the keys are comfortably large in both portrait and landscape mode. There is support for gesture typing, handwriting and voice input. Themes are available, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note comes with a custom Gallery app with slightly updated flat looks compared to MIUI v5. It defaults to your camera roll with two shortcuts at the top that will take you to album view of your local images and album view of your cloud pictures. You can't change this view, nor can you customize the default folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - share it, delete it, enter edit mode or just get more info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well-laid out, easy to navigate interface. It features a two-page layout - the first one is cloud music, similar to Google Music service provided by Xiaomi. It has similar subscription plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second page has your own local and cloud music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has cool effects, transitions and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi's Music app offers customizable equalizers with a few default presets already available for use. You can also try Xiaomi's MiSound enhancer, which comes into play when you use headphones, and especially, a Xiaomi-branded set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can edit song info and you can also enable automatic song info download in case the ID3 tags are empty. Lyrics can be downloaded, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note does features a separate video app, but you can also use Explorer to find some videos the default app doesn't recognize (but are still playable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic but there is rich video codec support. It managed to play everything we threw at it (including MKV and WMV files). The AC3 audio codec is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles and pop-up play are not supported by the MIUI's video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Amazingly loud audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note had perfectly clean output when connected to an active external amplifier. The smartphone scored excellently top to bottom, but that?s hardly the most impressive bit about its performance. It?s actually the volume levels which are far higher than just about all the other devices in the market and among the highest we?ve ever seen. That applies to both testing scenarios and suggests that the Mi Note can handle even large, demanding headphones with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clarity did take a slight dip when we plugged in our regular set with stereo crosstalk rising and some intermodulation distortion appearing. Still, none of those is a deal breaker so we?d rate the overall performance solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 13MP camera with optical image stabilization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note features a 13MP camera, equipped with a dual-tone LED flash. The sensor is also enhanced by optical image stabilization, which is supposed to with low light photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is fairly simple, though it has certainly changed since MIUI v.5. Now you have three panes - the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. Slide to the top pane and you'll get a choice of 12 filters with live previews. A slide to the bottom hides the advanced modes such as Panorama, Refocus, Delay Shutter, Highlight tones, Hand-hand twilight, and Manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR switch is now placed next to the virtual camera shutter and offers Live HDR, Auto HDR, Normal and Off modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manual Mode offers you manual settings for white balance and ISO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Face Detection switch is within the additional settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note resolves plenty of detail and the noise levels are kept low. The white balance is right most of the time delivering accurate and lively colors. The dynamic range is above average and you may not need the HDR mode in some occasions - your camera will do just fine. There were a few times the autofocus failed us, so we suggest focusing manually for critical photos, otherwise you may miss some precious moments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making a mess out of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama shots are available too - you can capture both landscape and portrait panoramic photos with a 180 degree field of view. Shooting is easy but the stitching takes a while to complete. The end result is rather disappointing though - the landscape shots come in 4400x700px pixels while shooting in portrait mode results in the more usable 3000x1300px. We like the portrait panoramic images though their white balance is a bit hit &amp; miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note features a 4MP front-facing camera for high-res selfies. Judging by the specs - 1/3" 16:9 sensor size and 2Âµm pixel size - it does sound a lot like HTC's UltraPixel sensor. This one however doesn't have auto focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images come out nicely detailed. This camera is among the best front snappers we've met - not because of the resolution, but due to the excellent color rendition and the high level of resolved detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note is more than capable of pulling its own weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see it puts up a good fight against the other snappers we've tested and comes on top even against some far pricier options.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>4K video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note camcorder has the same UI as the still camera. It supports slow-mo (the result is a 720p@16fps video) and time-lapse videos with customizable snapping interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note is capable or recording up to 4K@30fps. The bitrate of the video recordings is about 40 Mbps, while audio is captured at 96 Kbps with 2 channels (stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail in the 4K videos is very good, while the detail levels in the 1080p videos are only average. The colors and contrast are good and the framerate is smooth and consistent at 30fps. The dynamic range is above average and while the high bitrate helps for artefact-free 4K videos, 1080p ones are hardly something to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the automatic exposure is way too harsh and may ruin the overall video quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 4K video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 4K video sample and the 1080p video sample taken straight off the Xiaomi Mi Note.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Here the Xiaomi Mi Note enters our video comparison tool. There are plenty of 4K and 1080p camcorders you can compare it with. It resolves an average level of detail, but contrast and colors are very good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MIUI Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note comes with the feature-rich MIUI Browser, now with new flatter looks. It does a great job browsing, syncing with your Google account, supports downloads, there is a night mode, too. It is as almost fast as Chrome, but does not support Find on Page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it has a built-in Reading mode, which isn't available in Chrome. It enlarges the text font and strips away unneeded elements, leaving only the article you are reading in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a dedicated Night Mode, which is something we really miss in Chrome. It inverts the background and font colors and is easier on the eyes at dark rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the MIUI Browser, even though updated, still had issues with some pages and our battery-test browsing script. That's why we suggest you install Chrome, at least as a backup, just in case you need to avoid crashes or you need to find something on a page. Plus it can sync with your Google account easily.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note offers a great file managing app called Explorer, but there is no document viewer/editor pre-installed. There are plenty of free options in the Play Store (even ones made by Google), so this shouldn't pose a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v6 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blocklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, clean some RAM, it can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom and now flat Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Mi Note features the WPS Office suite, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard sound recorder, notes, flashlight, calculator, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the new Compass app. It has very nice and clean interface, shows the directions and doubles as level. If you lift the phone up then you'll get a nice augmented reality view with real-time directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps isn't installed on your unit, you can get it for free from the Android Market. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially neat thing that you should definitely check out if you haven't already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever else you may be missing, you'll find it in Google's Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note has a clear purpose: provide flagship-worthy performance at an affordable price. We think they nailed the execution but the 64GB model carries a hefty price tag - by no means extreme for what the phablet really offers but steeper than usual for Xiaomi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's still a good 100 euro less than what a 16GB Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will run you in Europe but the premium is easily justified by the extra software features, the more reliable OS updates, the proper after-market support and the microSD slot. And that's before you even start considering the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we're not trying to belittle Xiaomi's effort by comparing it to the standard-setting phablet. It's a comparison the Chinese have very well earned. Plus, although the Galaxy Note 4 is clearly being copied, it's definitely one of the more tasteful takes we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, the Mi Note mostly lives up to the promises made by the spec sheet. The screen is very good and the devices responds blazing-fast thanks to the S801 chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi wouldn't be themselves if they didn't throw some extras into an already solid package. The dual-SIM connectivity with LTE support is a great combo and not necessarily confined to developing markets. The 13MP Sony-made camera has been enhanced with optical image stabilization and a proper dual-tone flash. There is a 4MP UltraPixel selfie cam as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v.6, now with new flat looks, has its quirks but is efficient enough and not a bad looker either. The new launcher is clean and powerful, with rich customization options and security settings. The pre-installed apps are consistently good-looking too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is something for the audiophiles as well - Hi-Fi sound, lossless audio playback, super loud audio of excellent quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the few things that may not look as good on Xiaomi Mi Note's resume are the lack of memory expansion and NFC. The non-removable battery is something to consider as well. But Xiaomi is offering a 64GB model in case you need more space - and are willing to spend extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, before we browse the competition, let's check out our key test findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's explore the phablet competition. You bet the OnePlus One, now more easily obtainable, is the first gadget to come to mind. It offers a slightly smaller 5.5" 1080p display, the same Snapdragon 801 chipset and a 13MP camera sans OIS. The One runs on a special version of CyanogenMod, which is more popular than MIUI and with a bigger dev community.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> OnePlus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX4 has less screen real estate but matches the 1080p resolution, the MT6595 chip offers similar performance, while the main camera has higher resolution. The Flyme OS is gaining popularity and is quite similar to MIUI actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Meizu MX4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a will sure put up a fight as well, nearly a year since launch. The Find 7a comes with a 5.5" 1080p display, the same Snapdragon 801 chip and a very capable 13MP rear camera. It has lees RAM, but offers storage expansion, better video recording options, and the ColorOS will do a good job as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 7a</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy A7 has just hit the shelves and is already quite popular. It has 5.5" of 1080p Super AMOLED goodness, an octa-core processor, a 13MP ISOCELL rear camera and the elaborate TouchWiz UI. Metal build and premium finish, AMOLED as well as the reputation of a major brand inevitably add to a higher price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy A7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A previous generation flagship on the other hand, the LG G3, is quite attractively priced. An excellent package (only marred by questionable battery life) of a 5.5" QuadHD display, Snapdragon 801 chip, a 13MP OIS camera with laser-assisted focus, premium design and Android Lollipop can be yours for about the same amount of money as a Xiaomi Mi Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note has a Pro version, which looks the same but offers a higher-resolution QHD display and the latest-generation Snapdragon 810 chipset. The rest of the specs are the same, but in case you are after the best available hardware you should wait for the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro to launch this spring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Xiaomi Mi Note Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Note set out to be an affordable flagship. When such claims are coming from China, the flagship is usually the less credible part of the phrase. Xiaomi are by no means the first to put quality ahead of affordability. Take a look at a Oppo's latest N3 and R5. The Mi Note isn't cheap and that can potentially complicate things - users will inevitably weigh up things such as after-sales support, warranty and servicing. But there's a simple explanation as well: the Mi Note just isn't cheaply made.</paragraph>
