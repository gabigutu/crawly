			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All droids are equal but some droids are more equal than others. Google it. You?ll get the Nexus One. There are around 50 smartphones and tablets running Android today. That?s right, out of all the offspring they fathered with the Open Handset Alliance, Google finally have one to proudly call their own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What does it mean? Well, not that the ones we?ve seen so far are some poor half-blood droids but the Nexus One is supposed to be THE thing. For one, it?s the first Snapdragon-powered Android and it shows. The Nexus One is wickedly fast. The WVGA touchscreen is a treat to look at and it?s only the second AMOLED display to find on an Android handset. D1 video is sure to sweeten the deal too, and perhaps so will the Live Wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Awash in rumors well before launch, the Google Nexus One was officially revealed in January 2010 and it became available right after the unveiling event. Of course, the first units were to sell only in a very limited number of countries (UK, Singapore and Hong Kong).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway Google are to start shipping their Nexus One through various carriers across Europe, starting with Vodafone this spring. That?s about the time when Verizon subscribers will be getting a CDMA version of the device. Google have a phone to sell, so it?s a fair guess they?ll be seeing to it that everyone can have it. Now, will everyone want to? Let?s see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google phone has HTC fingerprints all over it. We just had the pleasure of the HTC Desire at the WMC and we quite liked what we saw. There?s no reason to expect less of the Nexus One ? quite the contrary in fact, a little bit of nepotism only seems right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One won?t come with the HTC Sense of course, but who would?ve expected so! The Android 2.1 novelties will keep you busy enough anyway, but the first thing on everyone?s mind will be: Is there any special Google treatment the Nexus One is getting?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest of the Androids is in a way the firstborn, for all the good and the bad of it. It?s all in the name really: a name that will open doors but that carries a certain obligation too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Will the Nexus One raise above its droid siblings or will it get lost in the crowd? That?s the kind of questions we?ll be trying to answer on the pages to come. You?re welcome to join: let?s see what the Google Nexus One is made of (and packed in, as well).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may?ve seen the Nexus One Desktop Dock. Guess what, it?s not in the box. But pretty much everything else is. Along with the handset itself, you get a USB charger, standard microUSB cable and a quick start guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a one-piece headset with music controls. The more demanding among you will probably get a replacement. Fortunately, the supplied headset isn't your only option since the Nexus One is kind enough to offer a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging deeper you'll also find a 4GB microSD card and a stylish carrying pouch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Nexus One 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Friendly size is a key asset of every touch phone, especially with screens getting bigger by the month. The Nexus One boasts a 3.7? display but into our pocketability requirements. At 119 x 59.8 x 11.5 mm, the Nexus One is quite a pocket-friendly gadget. The Google phone weighs 130 g and its curved edges make it look smaller than it actually is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One is made by HTC and it feels like Google didn?t have the face to ask them to really try and make it different. Or was it that HTC pinched the Google design and used it on a couple of their own phones. Whatever, the Nexus One is a solid, poised and good-looking gadget. We?re not sure though the uncanny resemblance to HTC Touch2 works in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another inevitable lookalike is the HTC Desire. But there?s nothing out of the ordinary here: the Desire is HTC?s very own version of the Google phone with Sense UI and an optical trackpad instead of a trackball. The Desire has a subtle hint of a chin and hardware buttons, while the Nexus One goes for capacitive controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most touchscreen devices, Nexus One hasn?t too much freedom to experiment with design but we?re happy Google chose to bet on quality materials and strong build. The slim and elegant body doesn?t take away from the solid gadgety look of the Google Phone, and the subdued color scheme is more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key design element of the Nexus One is the metallic front frame that extends asymmetrically around back. It?s got a soft brushed finish (could be teflon coated). The rear surface is rubbery and very pleasant to touch. It is slow to take fingerprints but when it does eventually get smudgy, the prints are very hard to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen seems to have no oleophobic layer (like the iPhone 3GS) and gets all smudgy in no time. Our main concern though is the really high level of reflection, which makes it nearly impossible to use outdoors in the bright sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, indoors it?s a brilliant performer, quite what you?d expect in an AMOLED screen. AMOLEDs don?t use as strong backlighting as TFT displays, which makes them power-efficient, plus image quality is superior. The Nexus One can?t really match Samsung?s Super AMOLED-packing Wave but is still a great performer indoors. It is the highly reflective surface and weaker backlighting that make it a bad choice for outdoor use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to screen sensitivity, the Nexus One reacts to the gentlest taps thanks to the capacitive technology. The 3.7? AMOLED unit boasts deep, vibrant colors and excellent contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Android controls (back, contextual menu, Home and search) are right below the display. They?re touch-sensitive virtual buttons so it all happens on the touchscreen with the Nexus One ? if you don?t count the trackball.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What might be a bit of an issue is the keys are capacitive, so they?re not usable with gloves. The four keys seemed to occasionally play up ? it may be a unit-specific issue but response wasn?t the best. Some of the taps just weren?t recognized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackball is underneath, and outside the touchscreen. It?s the only hardware control on the Nexus One. It?s not essential really ? the touchscreen is more than enough to get you around the interface. We like trackballs though ? the precise response and the nice tickle on the tip of your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackball can come in useful if you need to jump links on a webpage that?s zoomed out to the max. The other obvious application that puts it to use is the camera. The Nexus One hasn?t got a dedicated shutter key and users get to choose between two options: a virtual on-screen shutter and the trackball. If you go for the trackball, you?ll need to press to lock focus and release to capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only find the earpiece and two hidden sensors (proximity and ambient light).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Google Nexus One features a long and thin volume rocker. There?s nothing on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the uncovered 3.5mm audio jack and the Lock/Power key combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece. The standard microUSB port accommodates both the charger and the data cable. Some pins are there too, to connect with the optional desktop dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One rear only hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens and the small loudspeaker grill. There is a small LED flash in-between to boost the camera?s low-light performance but you shouldn?t be expecting miracles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera lens, LED flash and loudspeaker grill<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having released the battery cover, you?ll find the microSD card slot and the 1400 mAh battery. The Nexus One is quoted at 10 hours of talk time or 290 hours in stand-by mode in 2G mode (that?s scaled down to 7 hours of calls and 250 hours of stand-by in a 3G network).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing to note is the microSD card slot is right next to the battery so hot-swapping is out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All right then, the first thing to say about the Google Nexus One is the build quality is excellent. The combination of slim and heavy makes for a great hand feel. The first time we handled it, the phone did feel somewhat head-heavy but this is nothing to question usability. The non-hot-swappable memory card and erratic response from the capacitive controls are the only major things that you may want to consider. The AMOLED screen is amazing indoors but sunlight legibility is poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like the solid gadgety feel of the Nexus One. Plain, no-nonsense design for a powerful tool is perhaps a conscious decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, this has been the HTC chapter of our review. The Google side of the story follows. Starting on the next page, we?re on Android 2.1 territory. Hit the jump to the user interface and applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android goes up a notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android meter is ticking pretty fast, isn?t it? We only just managed to review a single handset running Android 2.0 and along came the Nexus One on 2.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 2.1 official changelog says there are no new user features. Instead things are stirred up a bit on the developers? end. The truth is Google have put a few of the newly released APIs to good use already but the update should be most evident in the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the Android 2.x changelog showing the new stuff in the last two Google OS iterations. It's not the full technical changelog, but only highlights we've hand-picked for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging and typing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Framework</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To that list we should also add a host of newly released APIs. The most interesting of them from user's perspective is without a doubt the Live wallpapers feature that allows developers to make interactive and animated wallpapers for the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the first (in a very short list) of novelties the Google Nexus One brings to the Android interface. The default available space is extended to five screen panes (mind you the HTC Desire has seven). More homescreen panes were available before as well, by downloading an alternative homescreen from the Android Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another change is the Application Launcher (main menu). The sliding tray is no more, there?s a virtual button at the bottom of the screen instead. Upon a press, the grid of icons smoothly zooms in out of nowhere to fill the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is vertically scrollable to get to all the icons within the ever growing app grid. Scrolling has a nice 3D touch to it: the top and bottom rows of icons tilt and recede in the distance, as if wrapping around the sides of a roller. A little like the Star Wars opening credits, if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen space is all yours to fill up with shortcuts to applications of your choice, folders and widgets. Folders can help you keep the shortcuts organized but you can't put folders within folders. Still, they can be used for a few quick tricks ? like faking a quick-dial contact list. A contact's photo serves as a dial shortcut so all you have to do is put a bunch of them in a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s nothing too special about that ? it's when live folders come into play that it gets exciting. The main difference to ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content. All sorts of lists can go into Live folders. For example, you can have a folder that contains all the tweets from a contact, or RSS feeds, or maybe even a folder with all the good restaurants within walking distance from a given location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Live folders are "Contacts with phone numbers" , "Starred contacts", ?Bluetooth received?, ?All contacts? and ?Facebook Phonebook?. What goes in each of those is pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The better part of the Android homescreen residents are the widgets. The new preinstalled widgets (new over Android 1.6) include a corporate calendar (the one synced with your Exchange account), a Weather widget and the Power control widget (a handy connectivity manger for your desktop). The power control was known as Switchers on the Galaxy so it's not really new but they added a display backlighting control to it so it counts here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional search widget shows suggestions as you type, just like the Google homepage. It searches local files or gives you a shortcut to initiate a web search, which is a really neat solution. You can also make use of voice searches just like with Google's iPhone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The live wallpapers do make the homescreen a looker. Those react to your presses or the currently playing music track. Effects vary from water ripples and shooting colored cubes to analog sound meters and polar clocks. They do little to boost usability but are certainly nice to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They reduce battery life though, by about five percent, so if that bothers you, you can switch them off just as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major advantage of Android is the notification area. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so called notifications area. Tapping on one of the listed notifications takes a context relevant action - for instance, a tap on a notification of a successful installation would launch that application; a finished download notification will open the file and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can pull the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it doesn't need your immediate attention you can let it roll back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the Nexus One you can press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It allows you access to the six most recently used apps though some of them might be hibernated rather than up and running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.1 runs like a charm on the 1GHz Snapdragon CPU processor of the Nexus One. Lagging and holdups are very rare despite the added eye-candy (which can be cut-down or completely switched off if you prefer) and the not quite responsive soft keys are the only thing that hurts the user experience (to a small extent).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this short video demo of the Google Nexus One so you can see that for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts available since Android 2.0 let you use the contact photo in the phonebook and to call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade brought by the new version is the support for multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign an IM nickname to contacts, as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, the various details are displayed in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contact listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the one for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any part of the image you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy - just hit the search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony doing good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The sound is loud enough so you don?t need to always set the volume to maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Nexus One, just like the rest of the Android crowd (except for the HTC Hero) doesn?t feature smart dialing (or voice dialing for that matter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. You can easily search them by flick scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the Google Nexus One automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold in next to your ear for a call. There is no chance of ever hitting an on-screen button with your cheek on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Google Nexus One. We weren't overwhelmed but the Nexus One still snatched a good score, meaning missed calls are only likely in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging monster with no (QWERTY) teeth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android SMS and MMS departments are quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like on the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the Nexus One allows you to preset the number of messages recorded in each thread. Once that number is exceeded the oldest message gets deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool extra available since Android version numbering went past 2 is the search functionality that allows you to quickly find a specific message among all your saved SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since the text box with the message still occupies a very small part of the screen giving you quite a small part of the text to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text input options are concerned the Google Nexus One offers a couple of onscreen full QWERTY keyboards. The portrait one is usable only for short text entries as its keys are too tiny for decent speed or accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The Nexus One is probably as good as you will ever need. For proper typing you should check out the Motorola Milestone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery: image zooming flawed by design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus One gallery packs cool 3D effects and transitions, which we find rather attractive. The different albums appear as piles of photos which reorganize in neat grids once selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left ot to the right when looking at a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch-zooming is also available here thanks to the Nexus One multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, you can't zoom images up to 100% of their resolution. Obviously the gallery displays only downsized versions of your shots and you need to transfer them to a computer if you're into pixel-peeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might have also noticed some of the threads over the Internet discussing the Nexus One banding issues and suggesting that it only has a 65K-color screen. The truth is that images in the gallery are also compressed (for better performance we guess), which results in nasty banding and color patches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, there are two important upgrades brought by the new OS version. You have the multiple marking that allows mass cut/copy/delete and Bluetooth file transfers from the gallery. None of those is groundbreaking but they are both huge improvements for Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player refuses to walk the extra mile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For some unknown reason, video playback has been one of the hardest things to do on an Android handset. First, there was no video player at all and then things started to get worse. No, we are kidding ? the video player app found on the contemporary Android phones isn?t terribly bad it?s just that the supported formats a pretty limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, looks and functionality aren?t great either but all the basics are covered. You get a list of all videos available on the phone and play/pause, skip controls, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is also pretty limited with DivX and XviD nowhere to be seen. H.264 mpegs is as good as you are gonna get, but at least those ran okay with no hiccups. Still, if you are willing to spend some time converting your videos you might actually find the Nexus One AMOLED display pretty great for watching videos on the go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player needs taking care of<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the music player saw no updates on the Nexus One either. Nexus One is not too bad at managing your audio files but there?s definitely room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the music player has four large buttons, which offer the four main ways to search your music collection - by artist, album, song or the playlists you've created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the music player hasn't changed much. It has that great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search by holding down a finger on a song. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabetical scroller, which appears on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. There are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Google Nexus One is pretty impressive, the handset faring excellently in all parts of our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is good for the entire range, remaining within 0.55 dB of the perfect straight line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings are also pretty great, comparable to the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel camera is nothing to rave about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things Google Nexus One has a 5 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels and a LED flash. It also packs a few extra features and settings not to be found on its Android predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new stuff includes built-in flash support (apparently the Samsung Galaxy made use of some home-brewed drivers to get around that OS limitation), digital zoom, scene mode, white balance, color effects and macro focus mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you think that all this sounds so 2004 you are right. Android still has a lot of catching up to do but the good thing is they are actually doing something about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty decent, although not exactly perfect. You have all the options on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder which can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key. With so few options at hand we don't see why most of them aren't available as on screen shortcuts to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, the only things that are accessible all the time on screen is a switch to toggle the camcorder and the still camera, a virtual shutter key and a shortcut to the gallery docked in the bottom right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Google Nexus One camera is average at best. There's as much resolved detail as we hoped but contrast does need some improvement. Plus you can easily see a pinkish spot in the center of the frame - it's easy to spot on our synthetic resolution chart sample further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Google Nexus One. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>D1 video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the Nexus One is as good as we have ever seen on an Android handset as far as specs are concerned. D1 resolution (720 x 480 pixels) at 30 fps is where its capabilities end and we doubt its users will need much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the video quality, the maximum duration of the clip, adjust white balance, apply color effects and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in 3gp format suggesting lower bitrate, which in turn leads to some compression artifacts. It also suffers from the lack of contrast, much like the still camera so videos aren't too nice to watch on a computer screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is certainly an area where the Google Nexus One excels. For starters you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for worldwide roaming and dual-band (900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA. The HSDPA is quoted at 7.2Mbps and the HSUPA can reach up to 2Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then move on to local connectivity ? the Nexus One offers USB v2.0, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier. And now that they have enabled Bluetooth transfers, there is very little more to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back on the positive track, we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser stops just short of great: no flash support YET<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One is the Google Phone and an excellent web browser is a must. Web meets phone say Google themselves but, come to think of it, this is the standard these days. Anyway, with the exception of Flash, the browser performs brilliantly ? no big surprise given the hardware specs and the latest version of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface, Google through and through, is completely minimalistic ? all you get on the screen is an address bar and +/- zoom buttons. The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view and the zoom controls autohide ? that?s essential for web apps because they need to get the whole screen estate all to themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Browser in its latest iteration supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and pinch. The +/- buttons do seem redundant, but the double tap and pinch zoom make for easy navigation of complex pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One browser supports text reflow ? a moment after adjusting the zoom level, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash support is the one letdown in this otherwise great browser. The hardware is quite capable of running it too: the HTC Desire, which is the HTC-branded version of the Nexus One, has Flash support. People have flashed their Nexus Ones with a Desire ROM, and Flash worked. So, it?s only a matter of time before Google enables it on their phones too. Unless of course, they share Steve Jobs? reservations about the Flash platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube have been trying out an HTML5 version of their player, which works without Flash, but we couldn?t test it. YouTube always loaded the Flash-powered version for some reason.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer does the job, with some help from the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Nexus One came with the free version of Quickoffice, which has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, so you can view attachments . Unfortunately, you can?t save them in the phone's memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally comes the YouTube app which, as we said, partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus One comes with a capable GPS receiver, which coupled with A-GPS, gets a sattelite lock decently fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that Google Maps come preinstalled. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation through Google Maps is available in the US only. Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually... assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market offers a lot of alternatives, some of them free. One of the first apps we stumbled upon when searching the market for ?navigation? was Wisepilot. We?ve seen it on quite a few other phones (feature phones included) and the interface looks exactly the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing about Wisepilot is that it requires a license for voice guided navigation and it downloads data over the Internet. That makes it unsuitable (or at least really expensive) for using when travelling abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the free options we tried was an old favorite ? AndNav! 2. Its maps are supplied by OpenStreetMap and it?s ad supported (a small ad at the bottom of the screen and another one while you?re waiting for route calculation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about it is that while it too downloads map tiles from the Internet, it has the option to preload them. You can either preload only the tiles needed for the route or preload a specific portion of the map up to some zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Preloading the whole of London at street level zoom requires a whopping 850MB (AndNav! can store the data on the microSD card), but a route across town is only about 5MB. Browsing the preloaded map works without an Internet connection, but you need to connect to the AndNav! server for calculating a new route.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the Android Market in the previous section and we found SatNav software, both free and paid, with very little effort. Since we haven?t heard of some of the apps, user ratings were a good clue of waht?s worth checking out and user reviews helped us decide which ones to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market made a very positive impression ? the number of available apps is growing by the day and a good deal of them are free. In fact as it turns out, if you?re after free apps, Android Market has a larger percentage of those than any of the application stores of the competition. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs, and each tab shows the best in the relevant category. The third tab keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screen shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is that before you install an app, you are warned about what the app can access on your phone ? the internal memory, your location, use the phone (e.g. make a call). This is great because it?s easy to spot apps that can be potentially malicious (e.g. a notes app shouldn?t ask for access to location services).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from there. That?s very convenient - we would let several apps download at a time and after we were done trying one out, we?d pick another one from the status bar and continue, until we have found the best one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty basic tools (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright, we?ve no problem saying it. The Google Nexus One is certainly one of the finest pieces of mobile technology we?ve seen recently. Google have managed to outdo the Android crowd, although what?s fair is fair: the MILESTONE is the uncontested leader in the QWERTY-enabled segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The political consequences of the Nexus One are certainly the subject of a whole different discussion. The thing is, the ramifications are not as grave as feared at this point. And that?s mostly because the Nexus One fails to sell as well as most of us expected it to when it was first announced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not the phone?s fault though ? from what we saw. The unsatisfactory market performance is perhaps entirely down to the Google marketing. The device has great performance and an attractive price point, but fails to cash in on the initial hype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, that may change as carriers worldwide start to offer it. This is not to say however that the Google Nexus One is the phone to rule them all and end them all. The mobile world simply doesn?t work that way with each and every device having its flaws. With the Nexus One those include imperfect sunlight legibility, unpolished multimedia and confusingly poor response of the capacitive controls below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you thought things will only get better for the Nexus One as it gains popularity, it gets complicated again. The problem is a certain HTC-branded twin with the cheesiest of names. The HTC Desire is just around the corner and it seems fit to elbow the Nexus One out of the spotlight. Adding Flash support and the Sense UI to what is essentially the same hardware might not make all the difference in the world, but makes the Desire a dangerous rival if (and that?s a big IF) the prices are close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the novelties introduced by Android 2.1 don?t seem all that important to you, waiting for the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 might be another viable option. The sleek and powerful handset packs the Timescape and Mediascape UI plugins to make it a pretty attractive package ? not to mention the 8 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those of you on a tighter budget should also check out the HTC Legend and its aluminum unibody. Don?t let the nice design fool you, the Legend is quite the performer as well, even if it can?t match screen resolution of the Nexus One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Legend</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason, Google don?t seem too motivated to make the Nexus One a huge success. Maybe they decided ? right in the middle of the whole thing ? that rocking the Open Handset Alliance boat isn?t the price they?re willing to pay to sell a few million Nexus One units. Or maybe Googlers just weren?t up to the task or never had that task in mind ? it doesn?t really matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What matters is they created a darn fine phone and if you are looking for a top of the line Android handset it is certainly your best option at this point in time.</paragraph>
