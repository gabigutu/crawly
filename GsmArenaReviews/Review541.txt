			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bezelless it was going to be, the first of its kind, but the Oppo R7 Plus didn't quite live to the promised edge-to-edge display. Yet, you'd be foolish to dismiss it on those grounds alone, as there's so more to a smartphone than the size of its frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what if the ZTE Nubia Z9 actually has pixels spilled all the way to the sides, and the R7 Plus doesn't? Oppo's 6-inch phablet, positioned where midrange meets flagship, has a wonderful metal build and an appearance worthy of its top-shelf aspirations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone does accomplish the bezelless look with the screen off, but fire it up and the illusion is shattered. Even so, the R7 Plus boasts an impressive screen-to-body ratio - and while you may think that's nothing but a catch phrase, it's arguably one of the more meaningful scores in today's numbers race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're yet to see someone disagree that battery life is something we just never seem to have enough of. Oppo has done its best and fitted a mammoth battery inside the R7 Plus, and also equipped it with the in-house fast charging tech, so it doesn't take a decade to fill up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A flagship-grade chipset would have been most welcome, given the rest of the specs, but the R7 Plus makes do with Qualcomm's ubiquitous upper-midrange Snapdragon 615. So be it, it won't win performance awards but typically makes for a fine daily driver. The 3GB of RAM and a generous 32GB of expandable storage shouldn't leave you wanting either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has taken a different path with the camera of the R7 Plus, compared to the regular R7. A Sony IMX278 sensor replaces the Samsung ISOCELL imager and the phase detection autofocus has made way to a laser mechanism, so we'll need to see how this new combo fares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first. Join us on the next page where we start with unboxing the Oppo R7 Plus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes in a standard-issue retail box. There's an AC adapter and a microUSB cable that support Oppo's proprietary VOOC fast charging tech and can deliver up to 4A at 5V for total of 20W of charging power. More on what this actually means in the battery section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A headset is also included. There's a textured plastic bumper in the bundle as well, quite typical of Oppo packages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R7 Plus 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus is a big smartphone, but you'd expect that, given its 6-inch display diagonal. It actually does a great job keeping dimensions within reason and measures 158 x 82 x 7.8mm. Spiritual brother Huawei Ascend Mate7 is a millimeter smaller in X and Y directions, but a is a fraction thicker. For reference, the iPhone 6 Plus is the same height with only a 5.5-inch display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weighing in at 192g, Oppo's 6-incher is 7g heavier than Huawei's but, at this end of the weight range, the difference is as good as none. That said, the 6-inch Nokia Lumia 1520 is both substantially heavier and larger in footprint and the just announced iPhone 6s Plus weighs the same despite having a smaller footprint and a half-inch smaller display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It should be clear by now that the Oppo R7 Plus was meant to get noticed, not lay low. Its sheer size makes it conspicuous enough, but the Golden paintjob leaves nothing to chance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo says the smartphone's body has been crafted from a single piece of magnesium-aluminum alloy. 48 polishing processes later, we have the smooth finish of the back and the outer frame, which are one-piece. There's a shallow groove chiseled out from the side, which adds a nice accent to the frame, but also collects dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty to mention on the back, other than the exquisite finish of the cover. The least attractive part is the plastic inserts required by the antennas. They don't fit perfectly, sit below the surrounding surface and have uneven gaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module is up top with a dual LED flash next to it. The assembly is ever so slightly raised, but the actual front element of the lens is recessed into it, so it should be safe from scratches. The laser autofocus is behind a tiny black window on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the camera lens you'll find the fingerprint sensor, which is lowered as much as the camera is raised. The depth is just enough to offer tactile feedback as to the location of the sensor, so you can easily find it without looking, which you'd need to be doing most of the time, given its position on the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down, a shiny company logo graces the back, etched into the back cover. All the way at the bottom is the back-firing speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6-inch screen pretty much owns the front. When it's off and you look at it head on, the display and the surrounding black frame blend together and the phone does indeed look bezelless. Glance at it from any other angle and the greenish tint that AMOLEDs exhibit when viewed from the side, reveals that the edge-to edge is nothing but an illusion. Good looking, nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the all-important 2.5D glass, gently curved towards the edges. It looks good, feels pleasant to touch, if you notice these kinds of things, and it's associated with premium smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the 5-inch R7, which comes with capacitive buttons in the bottom bezel, the Plus has the controls on the screen, thus allowing for a slimmer chin. With the space freed from function, Oppo found it a convenient spot to put its logo. The top bezel serves a lot more purpose with the earpiece in the center, joined on either side by the front camera and the bunch of sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is on the right site, and is located for comfortable reach with your right thumb or left index finger. Even so, you're unlikely to use it much, because fingerprint unlock works really well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the power button you'll find the hybrid card slot, which can accommodate two nano-SIM cards, or a nano-SIM and a microSD card. The tray is made of metal and is pretty sturdy, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker, which has been shaped to resemble two discrete buttons but is a rocker nonetheless. Both the volume controls and the power button are metal as well, fit snuggly in the frame cutouts and produce nicely solid clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom has the microUSB port, which is upside down (the chamfers are on the bottom). Oppo's bundled cable is upside down too, though, meaning the VOOC logo still gets to be on top when charging. The mic pinhole is to the left of the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top plate houses the 3.5mm headphone jack and the secondary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R7 Plus is a 6-inch phablet and handles like one. Most of the interaction with it is done with both hands, though basic tasks like voice calls can be executed single-handedly. The buttons are all very-well placed and the fingerprint sensor on the back helps a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The texture of the finish on the back is very fine and doesn't offer too much traction. In fact, the glass on the front is grippier than the back. The included plastic bumper case improves things a lot, but we're not sure that the trade off in terms of looks is worth it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD AMOLED 6-incher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus packs a 6-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. The math works out to a pixel density of 367ppi, which makes individual pixels hard to spot unless you stick your nose right into the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a beautiful panel with vivid colors, without breaking the saturation slider. Viewing angles are excellent and there's only the slightest drop in contrast when you look at it from the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our lab tests revealed that the display isn't overly bright though, only managing about 350 nits at the maximum setting. That's a relatively average AMOLED value, to be fair, both the Galaxy A8 and A7 are in the same ballpark, as is the Nexus 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness control is nicely linear - midway means 50% of the maximum brightness, and even at this setting it's perfectly usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R7 Plus remains nicely legible in the sun, and the numbers in our test reflect that. The Samsung Galaxy Alpha and the Nexus 6 are keeping it company, but the Galaxy A8 sits a bit higher up the chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus has a wide range of connectivity options. It's a dual-SIM dual-standby device with both cards supporting quad-band 2G, while SIM1 also supports quad-band 3G and a selection of LTE bands, which vary by region. The distinction between SIM1 and SIM2 is made in settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac both in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrums, and also Wi-Fi direct and hotspot support. There is a GPS receiver, Bluetooth is the 4.0 iteration, but there's no NFC, nor is there an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB on-the-go to let you attach peripherals, though it's off by default and the option to enable it is buried deep in the settings. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus packs a massive 4,100mAh battery, but it does have a 6-inch display to power up. Even so it's in a very limited group of phablets with batteries upwards of 4Ah, the Huawei Ascend Mate7 and P8max are its most noteworthy peers. The Lumia 1520 has only 3,400mAh capacity, while the recently launched Sony Xperia C5 Ultra pales in comparison with its 2,930mAh unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that we expected record breaking numbers from the R7 Plus and while it fell short of topping any of our charts, it still posted some great scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its video playback is the second best we've seen since the beginning of our own tests, only behind the original LG G Flex and a whisker ahead of the already excellent Samsung Galaxy S6 active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 3G call times the R7 Plus paces third altogether, if we don't count the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 LTE tablet. The third longest lasting smartphone for voice calls, is only behind the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro and the Huawei Ascend Mate2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the R7 Plus underperforms is web browsing, which drains the battery in "just" 10:39 hours. We figured it may be due to a poorly optimized built-in browser, re-ran the tests on Chrome and got identical numbers, so that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filling up the battery of the R7 Plus would have been a tough task, if it weren't for Oppo's VOOC technology. Basically, the battery is made up of two separate cells, which can be charged simultaneously. This effectively doubles the charging speed, while going easy on the battery and keeping temperature down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it also means, is that you need a special microUSB port and cable with an added pair of prongs for the second cell. Oppo bundles one with the R7 Plus so you're covered, but the phone will work with any regular cable, it just won't charge as fast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ColorOS 2.1-enhanced Lollipop<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo took its time with the jump to Lollipop, but finally made it. The R7 Plus is one of select few devices that have been launched with Google's now one-year-old release, and it's running the latest available 5.1.1 version. Lollipop was also promised for the regular R7, and we'll be holding Oppo accountable for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With ColorOS 2.1 on top, the differences between the two R7s are mostly under the hood. That is, unless you count Oppo's constant rocking between menu background colors - black on the R5, white on the R1x, black on the R7, now white on the R7 Plus - makes you wonder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical fashion, ColorOS makes Android nearly unrecognizable, with custom lockscreen, homescreens, icon packs, task switcher and settings menu, as well as extensive theming support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Color OS default lockscreen uses swipe gesture for unlocking, though it only works with an upward swipe. The truly new feature here for Oppo comes courtesy of Lollipop and that's lockscreen notifications. You can set up pattern, PIN or password unlock protection, and now fingerprint unlock too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side swipes are reserved for lockscreen widgets, but you need to start swiping from the extreme edge for them to work, so swiping out from the middle of the screen could have easily been used for unlocking purposes. Swiping in from the right opens up the camera app, while on the other side you can have one or several widgets, though the choice is limited to a few basic Google apps - Gmail, Hangouts, the like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back. It's our favorite position, the one best suited to such large devices, as it's the most natural spot to place your index finger, left or right. The HTC One Max premiered the design, although it used a swipe sensor rather than a touch one like Oppo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save up to 5 fingerprints, meaning your two index fingers and another two potentially for someone else, with one extra. It's hard to imagine a use case, where you'd be using any other finger - it's just not a natural position for those. The recognition works excellently and you seldom need to try a second time. Of course, a backup password or PIN can always save you, should your fingers be dirty, in gloves, or whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Oppo didn't quite get right is more of a niggle than anything else. The thing is, when you place your finger on the sensor and it recognizes the print, the phone shows the lockscreen for a brief instant before taking you to the homescreen, thus wasting precious moments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus doesn't have an app drawer, so all of your app shortcuts are available on the homescreen iOS-style, and the apps above the dock are organized in a grid of 4x5. You can still select multiple apps (up to 20) and move them around the homescreens together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4x5 grid may have been fine on the 5-inch R7, but on the 6-inch R7 Plus it feels a little wasteful. It's also not the only example of unnecessarily large menu elements, which Oppo has failed to scale to better use the ample screen estate. The font size setting doesn't help with scaling buttons, and it's also limiting on the small end for those with good vision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can group your apps in folders the way you like, and the dock can take folders too, though you need to create them above in the homescreen, and then drag them to the dock. Widgets are available as well, though there aren't many of them here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exclusive space is Oppo's custom homescreen page. Photo has been retired and now there's just Music. Gone is the unintuitive design from the R1x, where you had do swipe away the currently playing vinyl for changing the song and it has made way for more straightforward Previous/Play/Next buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen's contextual menu lists widgets, wallpapers, effects and themes. You drag widgets upwards to place them on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's Color OS supports themes, one of which changes the appearance of Color OS to match that of stock Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. There are plenty of themes available for free in Oppo's Theme Store, and some are better than others at dealing with non-stock apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default the notification area will show one row of quick toggles, a brightness slider and a shortcut for enabling auto brightness mode, the current notifications plus a shortcut to go into settings. If you do a drag gesture from the quick toggles row you get two more lines of toggles. There's also a Dismiss all button there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on a toggle will bring up its respective settings entry. By the way, you can access the notification area even if you slide down from any empty part of the homescreen (not just the top), which was welcome on the R7, and here it's nothing short of a blessing, due to the sheer size of the device. You can also set up app-by-app permissions for displaying notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is pretty close to the one in iOS. All your apps are shown in a horizontally-scrollable grid of thumbnails, which you either swipe up to close or tap to open. A downward swipe locks one or more apps, so they remain open even when you use the Kill all button to close all the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R7 Plus has some of the most comprehensive gesture controls out there. It picks up gestures with the display off, then others with the display on and it also recognizes motions to answer or mute incoming calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the screen-off gestures you get the obvious double-tap-to-wake, but also music control, which lets you play/pause/skip songs with distinct swipes. Drawing a circle launches the camera and you can set up a host of other gestures to launch an app or call a contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to screen-on gestures, you can swipe with three fingers across the screen to capture a screenshot or pinch with several (three or more) fingers to launch the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart call options are where motion goes into play and they are very useful, too - flipping the device will mute the ringer, raising the ringing phone to your ear will automatically answer the call and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One hand mode is available too, activated by an upward swipe from the bottom left or right corner. When done, this will minimize the UI into a more compact window, for an easier reach with just one hand. It's a lot like Samsung's feature in the Note series, though without the option for resizing. It also doesn't completely turn off the unused pixels to conserve energy, though the effect would probably be negligible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus is powered by the Snapdragon 615, coupled with 3GB of RAM - the same hardware setup as the regular R7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, Oppo has set different caps on the two quad-core clusters of Cortex-A53 cores and the R7 Plus reports a configuration of 1.5GHz and 1.21GHz for the CPU. The 5-incher had those numbers at 1.46GHz and 1.11GHz, while Qualcomm's default figures are 1.7GHz and 1.0GHz respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while Qualcomm's numbers are closer to the big.LITTLE idea, despite the actually identical processor cores, Oppo's take on the matter veers towards the Mediatek concept for True octa-core. Whatever you choose to call its CPU architecture, the Oppo R7 Plus is nicely equipped and we expected solid results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It started to deliver as soon as it hit GeekBench, where it placed close to the Nexus 6 which packs a mighty Snapdragon 805 inside. Obvious archrival Huawei Mate7 is near, but trailing nonetheless. The whole S615 bunch is entirely left behind. The Galaxy A8, sporting an Exynos 5430 SoC, is somewhat better, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the compound Antutu benchmark the R7 Plus splits the difference between the big boys and the pedestrian S615 performers. While slightly older flagships are comfortably in the lead, there are no S615-powered devices to threaten the R7 Plus. That includes the Galaxy A7, which scores nearly 10% less. Then again the Exynos-powered Galaxy A8 climbs to the top, rivaling last-year's Note 4. More importantly though, the Sony Xperia C4 posts superior results in both tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general results are much the same, when we head over to Basemark OS II. The R7 Plus is good enough to beat the competition with the same chipset, with the Xiaomi Mi 4i (not actual market rival, used here for performance comparison) coming the closest. Here, however, the Xperia C4 places behind the R7 Plus too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps most troubling here is the single-core score. It's of little consolation that the last place is shared with the Galaxy A7, when many apps still only rely on one processor core and the R7 Plus is finding it hard to keep up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo 6-incher picks up speed in the multi-core section of the benchmark, where it's on par with the S810-powered LG G Flex2. Mediatek's actual True octa-cores are stealing the show here, joined by the Huawei Mate7, packing an in-house Kirin 930 chip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different numbers, but similar proportions are to be observed in the newer Basemark OS II 2.0 benchmark. The major difference here is the multi-core test, where the R7 Plus is pushed down the ranks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 405 GPU inside the Snapdragon 615 was never one to impress with performance but Oppo does seem to be making the most of it. It posts virtually the same score as the R7 in Basemark X, both well above the chip's average.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GFXBench reports mostly the same scores for all S615 devices and the ones we picked for comparison are all 1080p units so there isn't the usual 720p/1080p division. Higher-grade Adrenos inside flagship chipsets perform notably better, but even the Mali T628 inside the Mate7 manages to pull ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kraken 1.1 JavaScript benchmark displays an interesting division between the compared devices. Snapdragon 800-series devices are grouped together, among them the Mate7 and the Zenfone 2. Then comes the second tier, formed by the familiar S615 bunch, with the R7 Plus smack in the middle. Trailing the chart are the competing Mediateks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All-round HTML performance appears to be more dependent on software, as members of different chipset groups are all over the place. The R7 Plus takes two important victories in this one - both the Mate7 and the Xperia C4 are a mile behind.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Uninspiring single-core results aside, the Oppo R7 Plus is among the best-performing Snapdragon 615 devices, we've had the opportunity to test. The GPU was never meant to excel with FullHD resolutions but does a decent job, while the overall results are consistently first among equals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface - it offers groups, contact list and favorites. The UI is pretty standard Android affair, customized to match Oppo's styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Anti-harassment mode located in the contacts app, which is pretty powerful. You can put numbers in a blacklist, block messages and intercept spam calls. The strange thing is, you can't block people from within the messaging or phone app - only in the contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports Smart dialing just fine (looking up both names and phone numbers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus scored a Very Good mark in our loudspeaker test, beating the regular R7 and the R5. More or less the same result as the N1, the loudspeaker test shows a peculiar correlation between screen size and volume in the company's lineup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus is a dual-SIM device and as such offers you the choice to select which card to use for different tasks. You can also add a name for each card for easier distinguishing between the two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all bubble-styled conversations organized into threads, with a big New Message button at the bottom and a settings button next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a heavily customized email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus offers a great Swype-enabled keyboard with big keys and they become even bigger when you switch to landscape mode. There is an option to change the individual key height in both portrait and landscape, which isn't found that often. Themes are available too. You can also have split or mini keyboard layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing the device in landscape expands the keyboard immensely and replaces the layout of the original app with just a text box, so you have plenty of room to type.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The most basic of galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo has come up with a custom Gallery for the R7 Plus, and it relies on simplicity. The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can't filter images by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app. Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid and you have two options - image selection mode and start a slideshow. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features when viewing a single image are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it, delete it or get a menu with more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image editor has also fallen victim to the trend for simplicity and offers one-touch color filters and image frames. Editing goes as serious as sharpening, blurring and applying a mosaic effect, which get a slider to control the intensity. You also get to crop rotate and mirror, and that's all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes with a pretty simple-looking video player with extensive codec support - DivX, AVI, MKV, MP4 files played without a hitch, as did MOV videos. We had no issues playing files all the way up to 1080p resolution. AC3 sound was a no-go, but that's often the disappointing case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files. The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work, and be in the same directory). Also, some foreign language subtitles didn't display all characters correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching a video you get a timeline slider, play/pause along with forward/back controls, a lock option (which locks the display against accidental touches) and a pop up toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung/LG flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no transparency option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dirac HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo's latest music player has quite a simplistic interface and is very easy to use and navigate. The music player UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a local list of all music, favorites, artists, albums and folders. There's also an option to add a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art/music controls screen. You can swipe between the two. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them under the album art, which imitates a vinyl record. You can add album art if it's not built inside the tracks (but the player won't look for it automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. That cycles through Dirac HD on and off, but only works with headphones attached. Audiophiles should be happy to head that the music player successfully played 16 and 24-bit FLAC files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus showed excellently clean output when working with an active external amplifier and it garnished it nicely loud output for an excellent showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones does cause a drop in the volume levels but they still remain above average. Some stereo crosstalk creeps in, but it's no worse than average and while the frequency response and intermodulation distortion readings also degrade a bit, none of the results is actually bad. So while the Oppo phablet might not be the best musician around, it's certainly among the better ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera looks good on paper, fails to inspire in real life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With 13MP stamped on the box and being an R7, you would think that the R7 Plus would employ the same camera setup as its 5-inch brother. You'd be wrong. Where the R7 had a Samsung ISOCELL sensor inside, the R7 Plus uses a Sony IMX278 Exmor RS imager with a 1/3.06" diagonal and 1.12 micron square pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences don't stop there, and the R7 Plus relies on a laser autofocusing mechanism, as opposed to the plain R7's phase detection tech. The number of LEDs on the back has been doubled, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the R7 Plus appears to be equipped with the same glass, as far as numbers go - an f/2.2 aperture lens, which is no longer impressively fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best things about the camera app is that you can switch from stills to video with a swipe to the side before you hit record. That solves a long-standing problem that many manufacturers choose to ignore, namely the different aspect ratio and coverage between still images and video. Oppo got it right on the R7 and here on the R7 Plus you can also frame your subject before actually starting to record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is straightforward with a shutter button, shortcut to the gallery and shooting mode button on one side, and flash mode selector and rear/front camera toggle on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a plethora of shooting modes in the Camera shop which you can install and add to your mode selector. You can alternatively leave only the ones you use for a less cluttered interface - who wants to scroll through two pages of shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The R7 Plus comes with the usual HDR and Panorama, but in typical Oppo fashion also has an UltraHD mode, which outputs pictures in either 24MP or 50MP. RAW mode is another welcome feature for photography enthusiasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those will also appreciate the Expert mode, where you get creative control over white balance (only presets, though, no temperature slider), shutter speed (as long as 32s), ISO and exposure compensation, as well as manual focus. The interface is a bit iffy when you hold the phone in landscape, rotating some elements and not others. It was the same on the R7, and the extra time Oppo had until the Plus' release didn't help. In all fairness, it doesn't get in the way of actual shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the R7 Plus fails to impress. The images are mostly soft and the level of resolved detail is only average. Dynamic range is quite narrow and shadows often end up solid black. The R7 Plus does attempt to do its best with what it's got and consistently exposes well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Consistency is hard to be used in the same sentence with color reproduction, when we're talking about the R7 Plus. The two photos below are consecutive shots taken with the smartphone less than a second apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UltraHD mode has two resolution settings - 50MP and 24MP, and it could be useful when you want to squeeze every possible detail into a scene. The added detail isn't as much as the number difference suggests but it is there and if you aren't working with moving subjects and have enough available space you might want to stick to that mode. You can find some 50MP samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode does a decent job in bringing out the shadows, without producing out-of-this-world looking colors. The images end up even softer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In normal mode the R7 Plus can get very close to the subject and shoot some pretty nice macro shots. If that's not enough, there's the Super macro mode, which fills the frame with even more of the subject. It forces you to take a step back and then digitally zooms in on the subject, so the per-pixel detail is not greater than you would get by cropping and enlarging in post-processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama output of the R7 Plus is far from perfect as well. Exposure is even across the frame but the stitching is flawed even on distant stationary subjects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus has an 8MP secondary camera with an f/2.4 aperture. The maximum resolution it can output is 3,264 x 2,448 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is very good for a front shooter. There's plenty of detail across the frame all the way to the extreme corners.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder on the Oppo R7 Plus shoots videos up to 1080p/30fps. Also available is a 1080p timelapse mode, where you can set up a speed in the 2x to 10x range. The slow motion mode from the R7 is gone, but it's unlikely to be missed, given its VGA resolution and overall unusable quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular 1080p videos are not very good, and the pretty high bitrate of 20Mbps is certainly not the one to blame. Audio, on the other hand is recorded at a lowly 96Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the video quality can be described like the still images - soft, lacking in detail and with limited dynamic range. Exposure and focusing tend to be steady, without unnecessary hunting, save for the initial focusing when you hit record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also have a look at a timelapse video, recorded at 10x speed. Detail level is the same as the regular speed video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we've provided an untouched sample, shot at 1080p@30fps (00:17min, 40.8MB) for download from our server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the video compare tool provides you with an option to see how the Oppo R7 Plus fares in the controlled environment of our studio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo browser and Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes with a proprietary web browser, which has an address bar on top and a navigation bar on the bottom always visible when you scroll. There's a fullscreen mode, though, which hides both and replaces them with a single menu button that makes them reappear when desired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handy feature is Night mode, which re-renders web pages so that black-on-white texts are displayed as light gray-on-darker gray to make it easier on the eyes in darker environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is also on board with all the familiar features we've come to like and take for granted like seamless integration with its desktop counterpart, data saver, extensive settings and overall uncluttered interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Security Center is a do-it-all app that lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Quiet Time settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, app encryption, to network and battery usage. The phone's Guest Mode is also activated from within this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R7 Plus comes with WPS Office (Previously Kingsoft Office) preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor, now with a redesigned interface, as we have to admit the old one was getting rather outdated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations. It can link to cloud storage, email files, and create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled, too, so you can get some work done on the go, if need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has three views that you can switch with a toggle on top. First is the Year view, which is not a problem on this diagonal and resolution, yet some manufacturers omit it. Then comes month view, with little white dots for days with events. Week view frees more space for the agenda, which is a vertically scrollable grid of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app, a sound recorder and a 3D compass. A calculator app is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of the box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP server support, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backup and restore can perform scheduled or on-demand backups of your contacts, messages and calendar. It doesn't stop there and can also save copies of your settings and launcher layout as well as apps, music and images, making it one of the most thorough manufacturer-supplied backup apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Superb build, premium materials and finish; close inspection reveals a few imperfections, though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gorgeous display with pleasing colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excellent battery endurance, exceptional video playback and 3G call longevity, web browsing a bit of a letdown</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ColorOS has the same vibe as usual - flat homescreen interface, a host of customization options and a wide gesture support, and all of this is now based on Lollipop</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprint sensor works great, has little use other than unlocking</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very good benchmark performance, easily one of the best implementations of the Snapdragon 615</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software package does the job, though the gallery is a lackluster. Music player doesn't have an equalizer, but there's Dirac sound enhancement. Video player has wide codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still images fail to impress, detail is only average, dynamic range is poor, and color reproduction is a hit and miss</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are little better than photos - lacking in detail, but at least focus and exposure are steady</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was a bit of a letdown to see the Oppo R7 Plus fail to deliver on the whole bezelless promise. Not that it holds all that much merit with us, it's just that the leaks leading up to its announcements had us all worked up and expecting miracles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once we actually spent a couple of weeks with the smartphone at the office, all that initial disappointment wore off, and the Oppo R7 Plus won us over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all starts with the upmarket build and the all-metal unibody, which tries hard to justify the less-than-welcoming asking price. The display is a high-quality AMOLED unit with vibrant colors and great viewing angles and coupled with the sheer size makes for a great multimedia-gobbling stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The insane 18 hours of video playback help a lot too, you can easily binge-watch and entire season of your favorite series and have a phone to use after (call for help perhaps or order food). Web browsing does deplete the battery noticeably faster, and although it manages a reasonable score on its own, it's just not on par with the rest of the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 615 chipset has been put to very good use. Its inherent limitations, mostly in the graphics department, make it better suited to 720p screens, but Oppo has squeezed the most out of it, and the smartphone delivers a respectable, if not quite class-leading, performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have been happier with a better camera. It's not terrible, it's just that on a device that excels in so many areas, average image quality sticks out. Videos aren't quite up to scratch either, so overall the Oppo R7 Plus is not the best device for imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're familiar with the Huawei Ascend Mate7, but haven't seen the R7 Plus you'd be forgiven to mistake the Oppo phablet for the Mate. The Mate7's chipset, while not a powerhouse itself, is as good or better than the S615 in benchmarks. The displays reenact the classic battle of LCD vs AMOLED, and the Mate7' LCD is one of the best out there, so it's a tough call. The R7 Plus has an overall much better battery life, but if you do mostly web browsing, the Mate is the winner by a long stretch. Huawei is yet to catch up on the software front and deliver Lollipop globally though, so it's phablet is not an easy recommendation at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a successor around the corner, last year's Motorola Nexus 6 is as good an offer as any. You lose the second SIM capability and microSD expansion, but gain a QHD display, a more powerful chipset and an OIS camera with 2160p video recording. The Nexus 6 doesn't come close to the R7 Plus' battery life, though, and lacks a fingerprint scanner. Depending on where you are in the world, you can have the 64GB Nexus version for $100 less than the 32GB R7 Plus, which is nothing short of a bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra is the most recent addition to the 6-inch club and it has a few tricks up its sleeve. 13MP cameras on either side, each with a flash - the R7 Plus only has an 8MP front unit and no assistance in darker scenes. The C5 Ultra has less RAM, a lower capacity battery, and plastic build, and you lose the fingerprint sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A8 is similarly priced where it's available. Its display is marginally smaller while the phone is as tall as the R6 Plus. It's a good 41g lighter though and, despite the smaller capacity, has comparable battery life to the R7 Plus. It does have a higher-res main camera, but only a 5MP front shooter, and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to go the less beaten path, the 6-inch Nokia Lumia 1520 might be a good option, provided you can still find one. Powered by the still relevant Snapdragon 800, the Lumia 1520 has an excellent camera and equally impressive battery life. It will be among the first to get Windows 10 too, a ticket back to relevance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it often happens with Oppo handsets, the R7 Plus speaks first to the heart. You'd proudly take it out, show it off, and answer questions on its size, build and origin (Oppo still remains somewhat obscure outside of its home country).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a more reasonable note, you'd appreciate the fact that its battery can outlast almost any phone and do so with a huge display that makes little compromise. After all, you'll have every right to expect all of this having paid a hefty sum.</paragraph>
