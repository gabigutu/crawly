		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been smooth sailing for Samsung?s Bada OS and the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is one of the first of the lineup aimed at the mass market. But beware, this smartphone may change the way you perceive feature phones forever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While amazing, the S8500 Wave costs a pretty penny. It did a great job of attracting attention to the new platform (selling a million units in four weeks), but Samsung designed Bada to be the ?smartphone OS for the masses?, so the relatively high priced S8500 wouldn?t be enough on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enter the Samsung S7230E Wave 723. It?s one of the first mid-range models and while it preserves some of the features from the S8500, it drops others and its lower price will help further the adoption of Bada.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s the report on what?s in and what?s out of the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cuts have been made ? the one we miss the most is the brilliant SuperAMOLED, which has been replaced with a low-res LCD. And the smooth 720p video recording is gone too ? another feature we loved on the S8500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the excellent connectivity is one of the key features of the Wave 723. 2G and 3G with HSDPA are common ground ? but Wi-Fi tethering (USB tethering too) is a pretty rare built-in feature and yet it?s salient to anyone with a data plan and a laptop. Then there?s Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth 3.0 ? rare to find these days but they are the way of the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave 723 offers an almost Android-like UI experience, a hefty number of free games in the Samsung Apps store and a 5MP camera, which produces good looking photos. When searching for a new phone based on specs and budget, the Wave 723 will pop up quite often in the search results, that?s for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we can?t go on without mentioning the flap ? a plastic flap with a leathery texture is attached to the bottom of the phone and protects the screen against scratches and it certainly adds to the looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can detach it if you think it gets in the way (after a while, it does), but it does at least offer an alternative to a carrying pouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip to the next page to see what this flappy business is all about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S723E Wave 723 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave 723 measures 109.5 x 53.9 x 11.8 mm (without the flap), which makes it a fairly compact phone. The flap adds about 2.5mm to the thickness (and a bit to the weight ? the Wave 723 weighs 113.8g with it) but it?s well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flap is plastic with a faux leather texture finish but still ? the leather and brushed aluminum combo has a special place in our hearts so this is one fine looking phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is a mid ranger with aspirations of excellent built quality. And it hits the spot. Too many high-end phones accept their plastic shells but it?s always a joy to handle a phone with metal casing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 723 is a looker ? not quite as handsome as the S8500 Wave, but it?s a very attractive phone nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Wave 723 is the polar opposite of the SuperAMOLED on the S8500. It?s a 3.2? TFT LCD unit at WQVGA resolution with unimpressive brightness and colors. The lack of ambient light sensor means there?s no automatic brightness adjust, which would have helped. Sunlight legibility was pretty disappointing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, are three hardware keys ? Call, End and Center ? which exhaust the hardware controls on the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 front panel. All controls are large enough and solid to press with excellent tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The End key will terminate the currently running app and take you to the homescreen wherever you are in the interface. Pressing and holding the Menu key launches the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece and nothing else ? no video camera, no proximity or even ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 hosts the volume rocker, which is thin and sits low so it?s not the most comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right we only find the camera key and the Power/Lock button. Both are tiny but at least the shutter key is slightly higher and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the camera launches instantly, which was pretty impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the microUSB port, hiding under a neat plastic lid that slides softly in and out. The uncovered 3.5mm audio jack is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7230E Wave 723 has a neat hardware feature that sets it apart from other phones ? the leather flap. It is attached to the bottom of the phone and guards the screen against scratches and accidental presses. From a distance it appears as leather though it doesn?t stand up against close inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the idea of the flap - it almost substitutes a carrying pouch and gives the Wave 723 a nice appearance. Better yet, those who don?t like it, can simply remove it. We did run into some problems with it though ? it got in the way of landscape operation (e.g. text input or using the camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is made of sleek-looking brushed aluminum. That together with the leathery flap gives the mid-ranger an air of high-end luxury.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, on the back we find the usual suspects ? the 5MP camera with LED flash and the loudspeaker. The camera lens is inset, but that?s the only protection against scratches. Because the back is flat, the loudspeaker gets slightly muffled when you place the phone on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We often ended up placing the Samsung Wave 723 face down ? the flap will protect the screen against scratches and the camera is kept out of the way of scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery we find a 1200mAh battery. There are still no performance numbers quoted but Bada OS proved quite efficient ? on a 3G network with Wi-Fi on and the screen at full brightness the Wave 723 went through a day and a half of testing on half a battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover things are a little strange however ? the SIM card is just above the battery, while the microSD card slot is below the battery. If we had to pick, we would have had it the other way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is uncompromised. We loved the feel of metal and leather (even if it?s fake) and there were no creaks and nothing wobbled. It?s fairly pocketable and if you keep the flap, you can forgo the carrying pouch or belt holster. We do miss the Super AMOLED screen though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? part TouchWiz, part Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada interface draws on both TouchWiz and Android (especially Samsung?s TouchWiz for Android interface) for its inspiration and the end result is commendable. It?s not an exact duplicate, but not too different either ? getting used to it doesn?t take long if you?re coming from Android or a Samsung feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the centerpiece of the Bada interface. The homescreen consists of several panes, each of which can hold as many widgets as you can fit (without overlapping).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the Wave723 landscape while editing the widgets allows you to add or remove panes and even rearrange them. The current pane is indicated by the numbered circles on top, which you can tap to go straight to that screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are pulled out from the tray at the bottom of the screen and you can put them back there when you don?t need them anymore. Since the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 screen has a fairly low resolution (WQVGA), it has a harder time fitting several widgets per pane (compared to the WVGA screen of the S8500 Wave).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is a novelty that has been borrowed from Android. It's is a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info like battery, time and switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. When you pull it down you get a list of all recent notifications and music player controls (if it?s running in the background).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS is marketed as a smartphone OS . The task manager is accessed by a long press on the center button so you can easily switch between currently active applications or terminate them. Just don?t kill the Widgets app or all your carefully arranged widgets will be put back in the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The System Manager is more advanced than the task manager and provides more detailed info for the users fluent in tech-speak. It consists of four tabs - the first one shows the device information (model number, firmware version, MAC addresses), the second one displays the battery info, while the third and the fourth inform you on the CPU usage and the memory status, respectively. Along with the CPU usage you can also see the currently running apps and you can start the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, all available items and applications initially spreading across three screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons form a 3 x 4 grid and you can change their order the way you like, you can also move icons from one screen to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the homescreen, you can add or delete menu pages when you turn the phone landscape while you?re in edit menu mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last one you don?t have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you lock the screen while playing some music, you can easily access the dedicated music bar with a single tap. You?ll notice a small CD icon at the top of your lockscreen, which opens &#x430; music console.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7230E Wave 723 has a phonebook that?s strikingly similar to the one Samsung puts on its Android phones. It has rich functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory and SIM-stored contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen. Gradual typing search is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc). There are plus and minus signs on the right of each field ? plus adds another field of that type and minus deletes a field (things work exactly the same on Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have added another cool feature to the phonebook, which is also available in the Android OS on Galaxy S. In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing works in other lists too where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Samsung S7230E Wave 723 was a pre-production unit and it was behaving a little erratically, so we couldn?t test its signal reception. The in-call sound quality was good, though it wasn?t very loud even at the loudest setting. Since there?s no proximity sensor, you have to manually unlock the phone if you want to use some of the features during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 723 has Smart dialing (sort if), but it?s the less useful kind ? the kind that searches only for contact number and not their names. That?s certainly not very useful because if you remember someone?s number you might as well just dial it. Name suggestion is so much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log can be activated with the call receiver key. It shows all the dialed, received, missed calls or messages in one list, but there are also different tabs for easy sorting of the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the S7230E Wave 723. It snatched a Good score, meaning missed calls are likely in much noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two major sections in the main menu - Messages and Email. The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers folder (tabbed) view and conversation. The first one shows all your folders as tabs at the bottom, while the conversation groups your messages by sender. An interesting option is the Scheduled message ? you can compose a message and schedule it to be sent automatically on a given date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. It works only in conversation view though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client looks exactly the same as the messaging one ? it uses the folder (tabbed) view. Multiple accounts are also supported and you can switch among them at any time. Unfortunately there is no shared inbox for all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 5 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to setting up an email account, the Samsung Wave 723 does most of the job. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set things up manually if you?re using an unsupported email service. The Wave 723 supports both POP3 and IMAP and also SSL connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text input you get two options - a portrait numberpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard. Given the not so big screen, the QWERTY keyboard is not the most comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no portrait QWERTY available ? it would have been rather narrow but we like having the option. And the protective flap really gets in the way of landscape typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery has face tagging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery or Media Browser, as Samsung call it, is basic - all images and clips are displayed all at once as small thumbs. When you select a file you can see it in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 multi-touch support but you can also double tap on the screen to zoom in and out. Zooming in is not the most responsive or fastest we?ve seen ? there?s definite room for improvement here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media browser can organize files by date, by tag, view favorites and the best feature ? view them by person. When you tag someone?s face, you have the option to view all photos with that person.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player balks at high-res videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first Wave was a grand master of videos. The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 however is more modest. It failed to play videos with resolution higher than WQVGA and it was picky about codecs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found that .MP4 and .3GP files worked (if the resolution wasn?t too high) and .AVI files with DivX and XviD encoding failed to play. WMV files almost worked ? the Wave 723 managed to generate a thumbnail for one our test videos, but ironically it was the high resolution one. The other WMV videos we tried gave an ?Unsupported video codec? error. So, don?t rely on WMV playback (we think no one is still using those, so it?s not a huge loss).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, you can jump to specific scenes using the "Mosaic search" feature. It breaks the clip down to several parts and displays the first frame of each to help you find the scene you're looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player, unlike it?s video playing counterpart, was up to the task. Tracks are sorted by albums, artists, genres, composers, etc. You can hide some of those sorting options if you don't use them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets and sound effects are also available. The Samsung Wave 723 comes with Samsung?s proprietary DNSe sound enhancement technology that lets you pick among Wide, Concert Hall. Music clarity, Bass enhancement and Externalization and also 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the music player is working, track info and playback controls appear in the notification area. Cover Flow like browsing mode is available as an alternative to a plain old list. Alternative visualizations are available when there?s no album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of the music player is also the traditional Samsung music recognition feature that lets you record a few seconds of a currently playing track and it gets back to you with the name of the track and artist. Another interesting feature is Find similar, which uses an online service to find similar to the current track. You can also add tracks to a wish list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. You can also listen to the FM radio on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up to 6 stations can be saved as favorites and the All channels menu holds the rest. FM audio recording is also available. The recorded files are stored in decent MP3 format in your music folder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output loud, but not perfectly clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We found the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 to be something of a mixed bag when it comes to its audio output quality. The handset is loud and fares well when pluged into an external amplifier but plugging in a set of headphones makes it mediocre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line out (which will be the case if you plug the Wave 723 in your car stereo or your home audio system), the handset might not break any records but isn't too terrible to listen to. Its scores are all slightly below average but there are no disastrous readings in sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play however distortion levels raise drasticly and stereo crosstalk increases so it's a rather mediocre performance we are left with at the end. The pre-production status of our unit could as well be to blame here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 5-megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and it features geo-tagging and smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 723 camera viewfinder is identical to the original Wave and very much the same as the viewfinder on other Samsungs regardless of OS. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the settings menu, you can toggle things like ISO, white balance, effects and auto contrast. Scene presets and macro mode are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 723 produces very nice photos for a 5-megapixel cameraphone. The amount of resolved detail is very good and noise levels are kept under reasonable control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from the Wave 723 are comparable to the photos produced by the much pricier S8500 Wave, even slightly better. Here's an impromptu shootout we did with the two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung S7230E Wave 723. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike with the still image camera, the S8500 Wave and S7230E Wave 723 live in completely different worlds when it comes to video ? the Wave 723 manages only QVGA@15fps videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clips are captured in .MP4 file format and are at the better end of the QVGA@15fps spectrum but that?s hardly saying much ? we wouldn?t use them for anything but MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is similar to the UI on the still camera and identical to the camera UIs on other Samsungs (again, regardless of their OS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a QVGA@15fps video sample from the Samsung S7230E Wave 723.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Advanced connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the mid-range standing of the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 it actually features some pretty advanced connectivity. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE of course but also dual-band 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the local wireless connectivity front you get the best available ? Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0. The microUSB port can connect as Mass Storage (shows only the memory card), DRM Media, Samsung Kies (shows both internal and external memory) and Internet sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Internet sharing, thanks to the Mobile AP you can also turn your S7230E Wave 723 into a wireless router for connecting up to three Wi-Fi clients that will use its HSDPA connection for Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi with WPS is also at hand. WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup and it's a hassle-free way to pair a wireless device with your secured network. As long as your wireless router supports the feature, pressing the dedicated button on it allows it to pair with the Samsung Wave 723.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser runs Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 packs a Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser 2.0. You can have multiple pages opened at the same time and there is Flash video support on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Wave 723 is multitouch enabled and pinch-zoom works like a charm. Unfortunately, there is no text reflow (dynamic refitting of text to match the width of the display area).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto-complete is available when entering an address, which is sure to save you a few taps if you?ve visited the site before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find-on-page is also available and the interesting Translate option ? you mark some text and hit translate, which opens up Google Translate in a new tab with the text pasted in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned the browser has full Flash support running all embedded Flash videos within the webpage itself. Our test unit failed to display Flash correctly, but given that the significantly more powerful S8500 Wave couldn?t keep the video and audio in YouTube in sync, we?d recommend using the mobile version anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-stocked organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 comes bundled with the latest Picsel Viewer. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. It worked pleasingly fast for Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (including Office 2007 docs) and PDFs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 features other common organizer functions too ? alarm clock, calculator, stopwatch and countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications get social<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also added native Twitter and Facebook clients on the Bada OS. They are nicely touch optimized and have similar looks and functionality as the respective apps for the iPhone and Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Search works on everything in your phone ? contacts, images, music, videos, emails, history, apps, etc. and you can search by date too. It works excellent and helps when you have lots of content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a simple voice recorder app and Palringo IM and Yahoo! Messenger are also onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the Samsung S7320E Wave 723 comes with a wide selection of preloaded games (we counted 9, but that may vary from region to region). Of course, you have to check out Samsung Apps, which has free games on offer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shopping at Samsung Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS offers a native application repository ? Samsung Apps. Samsung Apps is very similar to the Android Market. It has three tabs ? featured, top and category view. There is also a download section and search option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole idea of an app store running from day one is great and with the SDK already available to the developers we believe Samsung Apps will continue to grow in time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Trial GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7230E Wave 723 features a dedicated SatNav application. It comes with the Samsung Mobile Navigator, which is based on the Route66 mobile application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features, but the goodies come at an extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got a 6 month trial license for voice-guided navigation (drive and walk) in Europe. This relatively long term could probably be due to the pre-production status of our device ? the original Wave came with a shorter 30-day license. So don?t take our word for granted and check out the specific details for your region before you commit to buying the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, after the trial period expires you?ll need a subscription, which is quite expensive. All other goodies require some extra payment and the whole package will cost you a lot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Okay, back to shore ? we had a fun time cruising with the Samsung S7230E Wave 723. Let?s get the negative impressions out of the way first ? there is only a couple of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is the biggest disappointment. We can justify the switch to TFT, SuperAMOLED is much too limited in quantity. But we?ve seen better LCD units on other Samsung phones plus the low resolution ruins the Bada experience for us..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera was another disappointment, but that was to be expected as good video recording is rarely found in the mid-range. The poor Flash performance in the browser was another thing we saw coming ? it?s hardly a surprise on a midrange mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there are plenty of positives too ? the nice still camera, the excellent UI, the build quality and materials and the connectivity too (Wi-Fi tethering is still a premium feature). Overall, the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 offers a very competitive package in a really stylish shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other Bada phone we reviewed ? the Samsung S8500 Wave - had one of the best screens and 720p video recording we?ve ever seen. And it did an amazing job at video playback. But it comes at an understandably higher price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5750 Wave575 has mostly the same specs as the Wave 723 but a 3MP camera, no flap and no plastic. The Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 offers similar specs too but with Android 2.2 Froyo and DivX/XviD support. It?s a tough call between the two, with the Wave 723 winning hands down in build-quality (metal trumps plastic any time), while the Galaxy 3 still has the advantage of the more populous Android Market.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There are more Waves on the way ? an affordable low-end one, a QWERTY-packing one, a Wave II with a bigger LCD screen. Bada OS promises to become a prominent player in the mobile OS world and the Samsung S7230E Wave 723 is one of the best ways to ride that wave on a budget (if you?ll pardon the pun).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other companies have cheap Androids too - and really, if Bada is to become the smartphone OS for the masses, it has to beat Android to it. Symbian too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what we've got - the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 is an affordable low-end droid and offers a convincing package (and more importantly an access to one of the most popular OSes on the market right now).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A step above on the price ladder is the LG Optimus Chic E720 - it offers features that are good match for the Wave 723's powers. And Android 2.2 Froyo will be quite fast, even on a relatively slow 600MHz CPU.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to the HTC Aria (or Gratia) and the Wildfire - 5MP cameras, 3.2" screens (though just QVGA resolution for the Wildfire), Android with Sense UI. The Aria does have a slightly faster CPU and a 2GB microSD card in the box as well - but it's pricier than the Wildfire.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia X6 8GB packs 8GB of built-in memory (though no microSD card slot), nHD screen and a life time of free voice-guided navigation. You'd be stuck on Symbian^1 (a.k.a. S60) though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So that's about it. The Samsung Wave 723 is a promising and stylish full touch handset, with its main disadvantage being the poor screen. What's more the starting price of 300 euro is too hefty for its feature set and we suspect it should go down to 200 euro to really make a splash in the affordable smartphones segment.</paragraph>
