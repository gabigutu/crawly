			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel may not be an A-lister but they are trying hard to appeal to a wide range of customers. Ever since the brand was acquired by Chinese manufacturer TCL Corporation, we've been seeing consistently good products coming out of their factories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year, the company has come to visit Barcelona once again and they have an even more impressive Idol lineup of phones to show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel's booth is quite the busy place. In addition to the new four Android smartphones, the company has announced a bunch of Firefox-OS-powered devices as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's kick things off with the refreshed One Touch Idol family first. Logically named the Idol 2, it consists of the Alcatel One Touch Idol 2, One Touch Idol 2 Mini S, One Touch Idol Mini and One Touch Pop Fit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol 2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Idol 2 packs a 5" display making it the largest of the new Idol 2 family of devices unveiled at MWC 2014. It's a 720p IPS display, resulting in a pixel density of 293 ppi. The display produced really pleasant-looking colors. The viewing angles are delightful as well with very low shift in contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another pleasant surprise came from the build quality of the Alcatel One Touch Idol 2. It's very solid, despite the use of plastic all around. It's not of the glossy type either, making it very nice to the touch. Interestingly, from distance you can mistake it for a metal-clad smartphone, that's how good it looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internals of the Idol 2 include a 1.2GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of inbuilt memory for the single SIM version or 16GB for the dual SIM. The latter omits a microSD card slot to accommodate the extra SIM compartment. The single SIM version has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, there's an 8MP camera capable of recording 1080p video, while at the front a 2MP secondary cam handles video calls. The Idol 2 is quite thin at 7.3mm and weighs the astonishing for its size 128 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Androd 4.2 Jelly Bean is certainly not the latest around, it's very snappy. Alcatel promises an update to Android 4.4 KitKat, but hasn't committed to a date. The phone will launch in March.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol 2 Mini hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch Idol 2 Mini is aimed at those who find the Idol 2 too big for comfort. It's built around a 4.5" IPS LCD display of qHD resolution, resulting in 245ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is what it sounds - an affordable midrange offering. Although the display obviously lacks the crispness 720p resolution would've given it, the viewing experience is pleasant. Colors are great and viewings angles excellent, and the contrast isn't too far behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 2 Mini is made of plastic, but just like the Idol 2, it's matte and exudes premium look without the hefty price tag. In fact, it weighs just 110 grams and measures 7.9mm thick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features an 8MP camera at the back and a 2MP camera at the front. The main unit shoots 1080p video easily thanks to the quad-core 1.2GHz CPU and 1GB of RAM. The inbuilt storage is just 4GB for the single SIM version, but is expandable via the microSD card slot. The dual SIM version features 8GB of storage, but no microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean and, just like the Idol 2, will receive KitKat down the road. Its connectivity suite is very well thought out with Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel says the Idol 2 Mini will launch next month at ?169.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol 2 Mini S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Idol 2 Mini S is the 4G LTE version of the Idol 2 Mini and features an identical 4.5" qHD display, 1.2GHz quad-core CPU, 1GB of RAM and an 8MP rear camera with LED flash and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference isn't just the LTE connectivity, though. The Idol 2 Mini S packs a metal back with plastic top and bottom. It's a very good looking combo as the plastic is by no means the low-quality stuff cheap phones are made of. It's semi-matte and, just like on the Idol 2, could easily be mistaken for brushed metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The similarities to the Idol 2 continue on the build quality as both phones are equally well put together. There's no squeaking and bending and the phone is just 8.5 thick. Astonishingly, despite its semi-metal body, it weighs just 116 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol 2 Mini S features a microSD card slot and runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, with an update to KitKat in the works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Alcatel, the 2000mAh Li-Ion battery of the Idol 2 Mini S is capable of 400h of 3G stand-by time and up to 13 hours of 3G talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel prices the Idol 2 Mini S at ?209. We'll be sure to give the phone a very close look some time in March when it launches.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Pop Fit hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last of the One Touch family of Android phones at the Alcatel booth is the little Pop Fit smartphone. However, it doesn't want to be just a smartphone, it wants to be a fitness wearable and is the right size to comfortably attach to your arm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way it can track your steps, runs and workouts. Alcatel really wants fitness fans to like this phone and has thrown in an armband case for the Pop Fit. That's not all - the company also includes a pair of JBL smartphones into the bundle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This little fella isn't afraid to get sweaty because it's splash-proof and will be trendy for quite some time due to its translucent interchangeable back covers. There are a bunch of colors available including blue, dark blue, red, pink and yellow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featuring a 2.8" display of QVGA resolution (320 x 240 pixels), the Alcatel One Touch Pop Fit packs a 1GHz MediaTek CPU, 512MB of RAM and 16GB/32GB of storage. Popping the back cover open reveals a 1,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is the only one to feature a glossy plastic finish and you'll be right to think it's a fingerprint magnet. On the flip side, there isn't too much to wipe off, as it's a very small phone indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that it's not too easy to handle as it literally can get lost inside your hand. The small form factor means it's not expensive at all. In fact, Alcatel tells us it's going to start shipping in May at ?89 unsubsidized.</paragraph>
