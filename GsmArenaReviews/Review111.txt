			<paragraph>A cool looking touchscreen carrying a new mobile OS was enough to get the attention of even the most hardened of them techies last time we checked. Fair enough, the HTC Magic isn't groundbreaking but the Cupcake-ful of changes it brings, promise a whole new experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, for starters the Android sure looks more human. The formidable and weapon-like G1/ HTC Dream needed every ounce of weight to stand its ground. With an honestly lighthearted and disarming approach, the HTC Magic is willing to play by the conventional touchscreen rules. And may as well be eyeing massive sales. Compact dimensions and distinct styling, decent all round functionality and system expandability, the HTC Magic seems to have what it takes to keep both smart and feature phone touchscreens on edge. The second edition of the OS should have dealt with the issues of the forerunner and given the Magic that extra bit of pace. So, what do you call a good platform getting better and a gadget looking more mainstream but still creative enough? We call it good sense but who knows, it may be Magic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the beginning there was the unforgiving vastness of G1. Come to think of it, mobile phone evolution has always moved from huge to small. Android for one is quite aware and unafraid to press the fast-forward on evolution. Anyway, Google and their HTC counterparts feel confident enough to concentrate on style. Size mattered when they were about to take their first dip in the shark pond. Size matters even more when they're gearing up to beat a legion of seasoned touchscreens at their own game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full-touch handsets have been all the rage, and every manufacturer is putting their best effort to not merely stay in the game but influence it. Google DNA and HTC craftsmanship, the Magic almost has the impact guaranteed but how it translates into actual sales is perhaps the first thing on everyone's mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic is in for a real challenge and we are keen to see what it's got. We're back after the jump and ready to judge the game plan by the kit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Travel light but well-equipped<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the HTC Magic is pretty decently stuffed with all the essentials covered and a few bonuses to spice things up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the mandatory charger and a miniUSB cable for pairing you handset with a computer. You also get a nicely looking wired stereo handsfree, which unfortunately is one-piece. That means that replacing the supplied headphones is not an option unless you purchase a miniUSB adapter separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2GB microSD card is also supplied in the retail package of the Magic, plus a microSD to SD adapter in case you don't have a compatible card-reader. A stylish white leather carrying case is our favorite item in the box. We just hope the snow-white color won't turn to grimy-gray too quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick-start guide, a warranty statement and a list of HTC care centers are also in the box. For those keen to accessorize their Magic there's a list of available original HTC accessories, which include some pretty cool stuff.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Magic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic measures 113 x 55 x 13.7mm, which makes it a decently compact device. There are of course several full-touch handsets that are even smaller but the differences aren't really make or break. You can rest assured that the HTC Magic can easily slip in most pockets, without making much of bulge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 118.5 g is about what you'd expect in a handset with these dimensions and features. A few extra grams (and perhaps some metal on the chassis) would have given it a more solid feel, but it isn't too bad now either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are pretty fond of the HTC Magic. Its slick curvy shapes and pearl white gloss were quite appreciated across the whole team. Of course, the HTC Magic is available in black too but if you want your gadget to get noticed you know which way to go. We've been on and on about the lack of distinction between touchscreens, so what simpler way to stand out than a fresh paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>White is still rare, though not unheard of, in touchscreens and the HTC Magic makes quite a bold statement for a newbie. The plastic is nicely fingerprint-resistant and you can hardly ruin the phone's looks even if you tried very hard. Some metal on the body would've probably made the entire package near perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front panel of the phone is taken by the 3.2" 65K-color capacitive touchscreen of HVGA resolution (320 x 480 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is commendable with sharp contrast and good brightness levels on the TFT display. The 65K-color count turns a weakness on the very rare occasions when single color gradients are noticeable. In all other aspects the Magic screen performs greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is also remarkable with the colors retained almost perfectly even when the handset is awash in sunlight. The only thing that makes it worse than the Apple iPhone's display is the fact that it reflects more light, resulting in an occasional rainbow appearing on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The response of the touchscreen is also brilliant. A well-known advantage of capacitive touchscreens is their sensitivity, as they don't actually need a push to register a click. Even the lightest of touches does the trick which is probably a large part of the reason why would one buy a touchscreen phone in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the display is the earpiece, flanked by an ambient light sensor and the status LED.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The deck below the display accommodates the trackball and 6 regular press keys. That's quite a count in touchscreen terms but we don't really mind having them onboard. What we do mind however is their smallish size, which compromises usability if you have larger fingers. The tiny knobs have a rather short stroke too but are quite responsive to the gentlest of presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key actually launches a contextual mini set of options while the main menu is handled exclusively via the touchscreen. The Home and Back buttons need little introduction. The Search knob is the difference from the G1 / HTC Dream. The Send and End keys are positioned lower, their size and elevation nicely setting them apart from the other controls on the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the End key turns the screen off and locks it and to unlock you'll need to use the menu key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Trackball navigation is certainly one of our favorites. It might not be as usable as a D-pad for gaming but at its full-time job it's quick, intuitive and generally excellent. The trackball implementation on the Magic is very good, even coming close to the BlackBerry devices. Of course, it would've been even better to have adjustable trackball speed like on the Canadians.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note about the trackball is it gets heavily used in camera mode. While it's absolutely pleasing in zoom control, its service as a shutter key is questionable. The thing is there's no way for it to accommodate half-press for autofocus. So, once you've framed and locked focus you can't skip the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the HTC Magic are almost as plain as they get, the volume rocker the only control to note. It's way too narrow and even though it looks quite slick, it does need some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Magic is completely bereft of controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The miniUSB port is located at the bottom of the HTC Magic. Since there is no dedicated audio jack onboard this is also where the headset/handsfree plugs in. Unlike the Dream, HTC Magic slot has no protective lid over it. That makes it vulnerable to dust unless you make a habit of using the carrying case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the handsets is where the 3 megapixel autofocus camera is located, as well as the loudspeaker grill. There is no flash of any kind, suggesting that low-light photography isn't really something you can expect from the Magic. The loudspeaker shares a berth with the lens, lying beneath a fine mesh at the top of the brushed metal plate at the top of the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover lays the large 1340 mAh Li-Ion battery, which powers the Magic. Its performance is pretty decent, keeping the handset alive for a day and a half under some pretty extensive usage (half an hour of telephony, two hours of browsing over Wi-Fi, half an hour of music playback and a couple of hours of exploring the rest of the phone features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing of interest under the hood is the microSD card slot. Even though you will have to remove the cover every time you access it, the slot is hot-swap enabled so you don't have to power off the Magic to switch cards. Also, we are pretty pleased to see that the HTC Magic has no problem handling 16GB microSD cards, which is the largest capacity currently available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the HTC Magic is excellent, the plastic used looking quite durable. The white casing looks outgoing and very stylish too. Whether or not the hardware QWERTY keyboard of the HTC Dream will be badly missed, we do appreciate the nice and smooth hand feel. The Magic is a touchscreen of very friendly size and distinct face.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface got polished<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We covered the first version of the Android interface pretty extensively in our T-Mobile G1 review. The HTC Magic runs on the new v1.5 most commonly referred to as Cupcake, which brings a few tweaks but most things work the same way. That means that if you are making the switch from a Anrdroid 1.0-running HTC Dream or a G1 you won't find much to surprise you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest changes that Cupcake brought was the on-screen keyboard. We won't get into a virtual vs. hardware keyboards argument - both have pros and cons and which is best depends strongly on how the user works with the device and what they use it for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual keyboard is a nice option to have even if there is a hardware one, but it's not perfect. For one - the keyboard shortcuts are gone. In the G1, pressing the Search key + B launched the browser. You can't do that with the HTC Magic as there's no "B" key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of Android is very reminiscent of a computer's desktop - you have shortcuts and folders, not just widgets as other UIs have. A new addition in the 1.5 version, which we caught a glimpse of in the Samsung I7500 Galaxy preview, is Live folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main difference with ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content. All sorts of lists can go into Live folders - for example, you can have a folder that contains all the tweets from a contact, or an RSS feed, or maybe even a folder with all the good restaurants within walking distance from a given location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Live folders are "Contacts with phone numbers" and "Starred contacts". They are filled with what you would expect them to be - contacts that have phone numbers or are starred. We'd have loved to see more - Live folders are a great feature, but an uncommon one - and if you it isn't promoted right, it might not pick up at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another inhabitants of the Android homescreen are the widgets. There are two new preinstalled widgets that come with the HTC Magic - calendar and music player. The music player widget is simple enough - has a play/pause button, a next track button and shows the currently running track name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar widget is a little limited - it only shows upcoming events. That's nice since it manages to fit even long event descriptions but it doesn't show a monthly view mode, which is our preferred option on other UIs. TouchWiz, for example, shows a small image of the current month and tapping it makes the widget expand to fill almost the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping a widget to expand it to a bigger and more functional version is a great idea that didn't make it into this version of Android. It'd have been pretty useful to have onboard - it might have saved the users a few "No more room on this homescreen" messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts, which have been around pretty much since the Graphical User Interface was invented, are here and despite their age they are still quite useful. A shortcut can lead to an app, a website, a contact (in which case the contacts picture is used as an icon), or even a playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting contact shortcuts in a nice way of organizing your favorites, but in eyecandy terms, a folder with shortcuts is no match for, say, Photo contacs on TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Android is the notification area. As with the G1, there's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so called notifications area. Tapping one of the listed notifications takes a context relevant action - for instance, a tap on a notification of a successful installation would launch that application; a finished download notification will open the file and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can slide the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it doesn't need your immediate atention you can let it slide back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android has some peculiarities too. It doesn't recognize the concept of "running" and "closed" applications. Instead it gives the impression that all apps are running all the time. The system may close an app that runs in the background to preserve resources but as soon as the user selects it again Android will restore it to its previous state so that the user never knows the app had actually been closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might be a good place to say that there are actually two different versions of the HTC Magic. One has 288 MB of RAM, while the other comes with only 192MB. We had the former version for this review and we are pleased to say that all this background activity doesn't lead to any hang-ups or slowdowns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding down the Home key brings up a kind of "task switcher". It's not really a task switcher, though, as some of the applications you've already started may no longer appear running for the reasons described above. Still, the task switcher is useful as it gives you access to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gesture lock, the secret handshake<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gesture locks are gaining momentum and a cutting-edge OS like Android is bound to have them. While some versions require that the pattern is a letter, the Android way is to draw a pattern. The phone can be set to require a preset pattern of onscreen sweeps each time you're unlocking it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is you're presented with a 3 x 3 grid of dots and you have to connect at least four dots in whatever order you choose. We'd advise against using too complex shapes, as you have to draw the shape again if you are to cancel or change it, so forgetting it would be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose to have haptics enabled so with a little training you can unlock the phone without looking at the grid. There's even an option to disable the trail that connects the dots completing the pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The letter-based locks have the advantage of different letters doing different things - not just unlock, but even launch an app. Android doesn't have it yet but maybe it will get it in the next dessert-named version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has fields for everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add IM nickname info to the contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deleting unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details are displayed in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contacts listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it is more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the ones for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any photo you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy - just hit the search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Audio quality during a call is decent but it's a bit quiet even at maximum. Reception is quite good though, with the signal strength bar underestimating the signal strength a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slight change in this department, compared to the Android 1.0. The phonebook and the call log are still parts of one application, but the dialer is separated now. The dialer features a keypad and a list of contacts under it (you can hide the keypad) and also sports Smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting feature you'll notice when you make your first call with the HTC Magic - it vibrates when your call is connected. That's a good way to notify you that the other side has picked up if you hold the phone in your hand and not to your ear. But if you do hold it to your ear - then it's just irritating. It'd have been great if it were disabled automatically by a proximity sensor for example. Unfortunately we didn't find an option to at least switch it off manually either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows the latest dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker independent voice dialing is onboard the HTC Magic but unfortunately it is not available in every country. User reports suggest that it doesn't work in UK, for example. Our handset didn't have it either, so we couldn't test that feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging threads through<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. The Instant messaging department is handled by Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard in the HTC Magic works in both portrait and landscape modes. The individual button size is decent but the sensitivity is not perfect. Sometimes it just doesn't register a tap (mostly when you are pressing a key located near the edges of the screen). Hitting the wrong button is not uncommon too but word suggestions help quite a lot here- turning on the spell checking will save you quite a few taps on the backspace key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, we'd like to mention the interesting way that incoming messages are handled. You will see no notifications on the homescreen but rather a tiny SMS icon on the status bar at the top. If you have only one SMS message, the entry in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and the SMS section is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like with the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining to the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since even if you hide the keyboard, the text box with the message only takes a small part of the screen, which really only gives you a small area of the screen to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The list of recipients is maintained in a "Name 

 " format, which is a welcome improvement over version 1.0, which added only the numbers.
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. A really great thing is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. The "undelivered messages" section however has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail functionality and looks have also seen some changes compared to the G1. The most important new feature is the batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slighly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The scrolling speed has also been increased compared to Android v1.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard email client was also slightly modified. The tree structure is now gone and you have to tap on the inbox to change the folder. There is a new key in the general inbox menu for quick email sorting (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen sort criteria is displayed at the bottom left corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another improvement is the previous and next email shortcuts that appear when you have opened a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the email department has remained the same as in the previous version of the OS. What you basically have is still a local copy of your Gmail account bundled with its main functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: image gallery and video player combined<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Magic has got the missing video player which is accessible via the gallery. Actually there is no separate video player app, you simply open the video files via the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos located in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the name is a number indicating how many images are in that folder. Each sub-gallery has a thumbnail, which displays either the latest image (if the folder contains less than four images) or four thumbs if there are at least four files in this folder. There is no way to change these view options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the main Gallery there are two new shortcuts that allow you to start recording videos or capture images. On the other hand the flip orientation shortcut is now gone as there is a system-wide UI auto-rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, still there is no option for multiple marking of images for mass cut/copy/delete. However scrolling thumbs of images up and down is even smoother and quicker now. Caching images may take quite a while when you open a gallery for the first time, but once that's done, they are loaded almost instantaneously even if a folder contains thousands of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out has also been improved in this version of the OS. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen. Additionally, the zoomed area is where you double-tapped. The gradual zoom is on bigger steps now, which we find to be much more convenient. Another addition is the crop key in the contextual menu in an opened image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application is quite straightforward - you have only play/pause and rewind buttons with no other options whatsoever. As a matter of fact, the player's interface looks exactly the same as the third-party app we installed on the G1. Unfortunately it is only capable of playing 3GP and MPEG4 videos, which means that you will have to convert most of your videos for watching them on the HTC Magic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player pimped up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The icons in the music player in HTC Magic are different from what we saw in the T-Mobile G1. We do like them a lot better than the simple white icons in the previous edition of the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the music player hasn't seen too many changes except for a single great feature added. Holding down a finger over a song activates the menu that allows you to look up the song title serves in YouTube or through a Google search. What's even better the YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the the gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabetical slider now, which appears on the right side of the tracks list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. There are no equalizer presets yet nor any alternative visualizations. Another letdown concerning the music capabilities of the Magic is that there is no standard 3.5mm audio jack or at least a miniUSB to 3.5mm adapter in the retail package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tolerable audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic audio output is decent but not great by any means. The noise level dynamic range and stereo crosstalk are the strong points of its performance but the rest of the readings are somewhat below-par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has cut-off bass frequencies, probably due to some kind of high-pass filter meant to improve sound on small size headphones. The distortion levels are acceptable but if you compare them to the iPhone 3GS they are several times higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you are the audiophile type that can tell the difference between a CD and a vinyl record in favor of the latter - don't bother turning the music player on. The rest of you will probably be fine with it. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel camera gets improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Magic is equipped with a 3 megapixel autofocus camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. Missing any flash whatsoever strongly suggests that you better not count on it in low-light conditions. Knowing how things work in this business we would guess that the camera module is the same as in the T-Mobile G1 (or HTC Dream if you prefer). However some fine processing algorithm tuning has resulted in much better output this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has gone through great changes since the first version of the Android OS. The all too simple iPhone-like application is now replaced by a much more functional one. Yet you still get the free of any overlay controls viewfinder by default that makes taking a photo as easy as pressing the trackball.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the screen reveals the digital zoom bar on the left and the image gallery shortcut on the right while pressing the menu button brings up many more options. Five different options appear on a tab at the bottom of the screen with the sixth button leading to an advanced settings menu. There you can set the metering mode, sharpness, saturation and contrast of the photos and you can add a viewfinder gridline to assist you in your framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings appearing on the viewfinder allow changing the capture mode (there's video this time too, you know), the image resolution, the white balance and the exposure. You can also activate a 2 or 10 second self-timer from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strange enough there was no geo-tagging option on our HTC Magic. Given that this on one of the grand total of two options present on the G1 we don't quite get it why Google's R&amp;D omitted it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the absence of a dedicated camera key on the HTC Magic you also have to use the trackball for taking a photo. This is certainly better than tapping the screen itself but it cannot match the usability of a dedicated two-stage camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic image quality is rather good for a 3 MP shooter. As we already mentioned it pulls off better shots than the G1 used to, thanks to the more properly adjusted now white balance and image suppression algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result is nice photos with pleasing colors and a good amount of resolved detail. Surely we have seen better but there's nothing too bad to say about the Dream photos either. There is no over sharpening or purple fringing and the dynamic range seems much better than that of the G1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC Magic. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic matches the iPhone 3GS resolution, while at the same time producing cleaner, less-noisy photos. Notice that the noise that the iPhone has generated in each part of the color chart is much more than that of the Magic. The HTC has also handled the Grayscale better with more of the bars distinguishable than on the iPhone's photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording makes an Android debut, fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Android OS v1.0-running G1s, HTC Magic is capable of recording video too. The CIF resolution might not be a thing to brag about but it certainly is better than nothing. It took Apple 2 years to come up with VGA videos so we are guessing CIF in seven months isn't too bad of an achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera. It sports a setting for picking between MP4 and 3GP (H.263) encoding, which theoretically should give you the choice between smaller file and a higher-quality video. In practice the low resolution makes sure that the differences aren't really conceivable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic like its predecessor - the G1 offers excellent all-round connectivity. The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support guarantees that the handset will be capable of international roaming while the dual-band 3G ensures fast network data transfers. The 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA takes those speeds even further up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most convenient local connectivity options - Wi-Fi is also onboard. It's very easy to get running, with no need to dig through the menus or set various parameters. Just click on the desired network, type a password if needed and there you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Bluetooth connectivity is crippled in a way resembling the Apple iPhone's. It usage is only limited to headset support. The A2DP profile is good to have onboard but what we really would have liked is data transfer. Let's hope that this will receive its due attention with the next OS update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magic also sport USB connectivity and has USB Mass storage mode support. Once you've connected the handset via the original cable, you should check your notifications area by sliding it down. You will find a USB connection notification there, allowing you to perform the additional task of mount your phone via USB. It's only then that your Magic will appear as a removable drive on your computer. Bear in mind that it will only mount the memory card slot, not the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately due to some legal issues Google had with T-Mobile, tethering has been disabled on the Android devices out-of-the-box. But one can still activate it through some tweaking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing the connectivity options can be done in two ways - you can either open the Main Menu and look up Wireless controls under Settings, or you can push the hardware menu button on the home screen and select Settings in the contextual menu. The second option is much more convenient when you have a long list of applications crowding the main menu and you don't want to scroll all the way down to get to the Settings icon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you may suspect, the Android browser is fast and the interface clean. But unlike so many of its smartphone siblings, Flash support is not available. The HTC Magic web browser is based on the same open source WebKit used in Chrome and Safari, and this accounts for the smooth user experience. Pages load quickly, and navigating with fingers is just as easy as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having a capacitive touch-screen, the Magic does not support multi-touch unless tweaked. This means that right out of the box pinch zooming is not an option. You will have to rely on the two virtual zoom buttons at the bottom of the screen or on the familiar double tap routine which works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser also allows you to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves smooth transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android team added a rather nifty function to help you read when in maximum zoom-out mode. This is a small rectangle which acts like a magnifier and enables you to read small portions of the microscopic web page. You can move it with your finger and sometimes it can be quite useful. But in the end, this is just another zoom option since the moment you release your finger, the magnifier disappears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser handled perfectly most of the pages we threw at it and we are very satisfied with the results. The capacitive screen coupled with the browser's performance makes surfing on the Magic a real treat the only thing missing is Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube. From a purely practical point of view Flash is one of the most serious upgrades that the Hero brings over the Magic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Magic's elderly brother, the T-Mobile G1, was heavily criticized for the lack of a document viewer - a must for every smartphone, especially in this price range. Luckily, this time we found what we were looking for - using the Quickoffice and the PDF viewer you can view your office documents stored in the phone's memory, the microSD card or received via email. Editing isn't possible, at this stage but this is still a huge step forward for the Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you receive office documents or PDF files as mail attachments, they can be displayed and forwarded. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them in the phone's memory (that only works for image, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible tough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly, monthly and today. Adding a new event is easy and quick, and you can also set an alarm to remind you about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and very comfy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't find a preloaded voice recorder but it took us less than a minute to download a free and fully-functional one from the Android Market. It even gives you the option to send the voice message right after it's been recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Magic packs the YouTube app which partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash video support. Its interface is simple enough to allow you to find what you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic GPS receiver needed a couple of minutes upon to achieve a satellite lock from cold start, which is quite a lot. Subsequent locks, as usual, were much faster to acquire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that the only application you can rely on for navigation right out of the box is Google Maps. Its interface is slightly different from what we've seen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick double-tapping ca no longer be used for zooming in and out; instead, you now need to use the two virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen. These are hidden when not in use and only appear when you touch the screen. But despite the little changes, this is still the familiar Google Maps app we know and like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally the HTC Magic also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of the Google Maps on HTC Magic. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in you can open a 360-degree photographic view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation isn't possible using Google Maps. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your goal sometimes? assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there is a free app that allows turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation using the HTC Magic and it's called AndNav2. The latter uses Google Maps, again, but adds some extra features that justify the download. AndNav2 uses the inbuilt digital compass and you no longer have to turn the handset to orientate the map to match your direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the AndNav2 app offers turn-by-turn navigation, which isn't bad at all. The voice-guided part, however, is questionable - to use it you need an extra, free app (Text-To-Speech Library) which supports English along with many other languages. Using text-to-speech engines instead of pre-recorded voices is bound to give you a horrific computerized voice output but still the app is helpful.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android being an open-source OS was sure to attract a lot of attention from modders. You can change quite a lot on your Android phone - you just have to know how. However, not everyone will be comfortable with flashing their brand-new-bought-with-hard-earned-cash phone, but as the saying goes - no pain, no gain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably seen a video of HTC's Sense UI and are worried if you'd be able to get it on your Magic (we know because you're reading this section). Well, the answer is yes - you can! It's still unclear if there will be an official way to do it but if are willing to flash the phone with an unofficial ROM you can get it right on the spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting Sense UI on the Magic has a lot of advantages, not the least of which is using an interface that is the result of many years of tweaking an OS with an aging interface that doesn't stand up to newcomers (we won't mention any names).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting side effect - since HTC Hero supports multi-touch and technically the hardware of the Magic also supports it, then the Hero ROM enables multi-touch as if by? Magic!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that there are two versions of the Magic - one with 192MB RAM and one with 288MB RAM, while the Hero has 288MB. The lower amount of RAM seems to be causing the Sense UI to run slow, but it could also have something to do with it not being fully optimized yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, since this is an unofficial port there could be all sorts of issues and bugs. These things are being fixed slowly, but be sure to read carefully what the author of the port wrote and what people who have tested it have commented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usually the xda-developers forum is your best source for information on the matter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market: reloaded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic comes with very little preinstalled applications - Google Maps, Google Talk, the Quickoffice, the PDF viewer and the YouTube client are all you get. However with the Android Market open for business you can finds a large number of apps (a good portion of them is free by the way) which can be downloaded directly from the handset using Wi-Fi or the mobile network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the warning shown if the application you're about to download has potentially unsafe access to personal data, connectivity settings or else. The warning says exactly what data will be accessed so you can abort the download if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market follows the logic of the pioneering Apple App Store. Everything about it - the structure, the look - is pretty familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding a specific app is pretty easy even now, several months after our first meeting with the Android Market (during the T-Mobile G1 review) when there are a lot more apps available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty useless (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers and video players).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, there are also games... lots of them. That's quite nice, as the Magic has only one game pre-loaded (the name Teeter ring a bell?).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was a pleasure having the HTC Magic around. The little fella puts the young OS into a nicely-looking device with much broader appeal than the G1. The Magic performed quite well, all the more so considering that its platform is just about coming of age. It does have a few flaws and they do count against when choosing your next handset but the handling and the novelty are a huge point in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it looks there's bright future ahead for the Android OS with almost every major manufacturer embracing the platform. With a rapidly growing user community, the apps available should mushroom. Tweaking up an open source OS must be quicker and more efficient than any other platform out there - and we're really talking tweaks here cause the Android is very much up and running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Magic is a reasonable purchase now, and has the potential to a become a bargain in the future. We saw most of that potential fulfilled with the iPhone a couple of years ago and we hope Android handsets will learn from Apple's mistakes and do even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But passing a final verdict is always a matter of how the handset in question fares against its main market rivals. The HTC Magic is quite keen to stir touchscreen waters so it needs to deal with the ripples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone is a name that echoes menacingly in the touchscreen world. The pricing of Apple's latest tech-toy puts it in a different league but it doesn't really matter if you are after the ultimate touch interface. The App Store has a good advantage over the Android market at the moment but can Apple really battle against half the mobile world?</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 3GS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other half of the world in this game is the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. Priced way below the Magic, it offers an equally young platform, backed up by the expertise of the market leader. The much smoother handling and far better looks of the Magic against the Symbian pedigree of the Finn do make this less of an easy choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a glance at the Windows Mobile offerings reveals what could've been the Magic's greatest rival? was it not a step-brother. The HTC Touch Diamond2 has superior functionality, pretty smooth handling and a comparable price tag. With WinMo applications vastly more than the Android portfolio, the Magic's future promise is pretty much the saving grace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But well, it's easy to understand why the HTC Magic and Android are looking out to the future. There just isn't much to look back to. The HTC Magic (also available as T-Mobile myTouch 3G) doesn't carry the load of the HTC Dream a.k.a. G1 on its shoulders. And we don't mean the QWERTY keyboard here. The Magic is just not burdened with the expectations everyone had of the forerunner. All it needs to do is speak a universal language and reach to wider audience. Our humble opinion is it does.</paragraph>
