			<subsectionTitle>Press conference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC MWC press conference saw the announcements of six Android-running devices. We?ve got five new smartphones and the Flyer tablet that should help strengthen the HTC positions within the Android family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The show really got going when HTC announced the next generation of high-end Android smartphones - the Desire S, and Incredible S. The cute little HTC Wildfire S was also unveiled and should be one of the devices to help Android finally make the low-end breakthrough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two the new devices were particularly interesting. The HTC Salsa and ChaCha are both featuring dedicated Facebook buttons and have their designs inspired by the popular social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Salsa and the ChaCha are mid-range devices but with a cool feature like that they might enjoy excellent market performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even managed to convince Mark Zuckerberg himself to record a short video, praising the company efforts to extend the Facebook integration on their phones. What's interesting is that Zuckerberg promised many more phones with Facebook integration in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the press conference we also managed to spend some time with the new handsets (and the Flyer) and, naturally, we?ve got the whole thing documented.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MWC booth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course we also stopped by the HTC Booth in the MWC, but we had less luck there. The S handsets had cables attached to them, while the Facebook duo and the Flyer were sitting behind glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless we got all the images and first-hand impressions we needed and the hands-on articles are already waiting for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find the Wildfire S, Desire S and the Incredible S on the next page, while the Facebook duo and the Flyer tablet are on page three.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Incredible S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Incredible S has a 4" WVGA screen and packs an 8MP camera with dual-LED flash and 720p video capture. After that start you might find some of its other specs a bit underwhelming - it will launch with Android 2.2 Froyo and a single-core 1GHz CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In its nature, the HTC Incredible S is a minor update to the Verizon-bound HTC Droid Incredible. You get the new generation Snapdragon chipset inside, the more powerful Adreno 205 GPU and some extra RAM inside an identically looking shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we have to admit that we were envied our American friends for being the only ones to get the Droid Incredible at the time, we are not particularly confident of the Incredible S prospects right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With dual-core Gingerbread-running smartphones with 1GB of RAM just around the corner, the HTC flagship is decidedly looking uncompetitive. Of course the Incredible S might become a hot deal if HTC fit it with a price-tag that suits its new position in the pecking order. Here?s hoping!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh and the HTC Incredible S can do an amazing trick - rotate the capacitive keys so they match the orientation of the display!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S has an aluminum unibody and a 3.7" WVGA screen. Its camera is just a 5MP snapper but can record 720p video too. It packs a 1GHz processor and will launch with Android 2.3 Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?Here?s an idea: Take the best and make it better? is the slogan sitting on top of the HTC Desire S promo materials. And in theory that?s how it should have worked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, once again, the update from Froyo to Gingerbread, slightly more RAM and a bit better GPU don?t seem to be enough to bring a year-old handset back to the top. And yes we do like the new design better, but changes are quite subtle there too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Wildfire S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S has a 3.2" HVGA screen, 600MHz CPU and 512MB RAM. It will launch with Android 2.3 Gingerbread too, which just embarrasses the Incredible S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the HTC Wildfire S is the only one of the S trio that we find to be a worthy update. The vital resolution increase, combined with the shrinking of the body and the slightly improved processing power make the Wildfire S a very decent lower mid-range handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the disastrous QVGA screen mounted on the original Wildfire, seeing the HVGA on the Wildfire S is really a joy to our eyes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the new Wildfire also seemed perfectly smooth and the Sense UI adds quite a lot to its usability. Very good marks for the little fella!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Salsa and ChaCha<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Salsa and ChaCha are mid-range Android smartphones that take Facebook integration another step forward. Not only do they have Facebook-inspired designs but they also feature a dedicated button they will make accessing your profile easier than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha is one of the very few Android handsets to come in the portrait QWERTY bar form factor. The Salsa on the other hands looks like a slightly trimmed down version of the HTC Legend and a quick peek at its specs sheet will tell you that this is exactly what it is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Flyer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Flyer is HTC's first tablet - it packs a 7" screen with 1024x768 pixels resolution. Inside it ticks a powerful 1.5GHz processor, but the tablet will be running Android 2.x (that is the phone line), instead of 3.0 Honeycomb (which is the tablet-ready variant). The HTC Flyer will come with Sense UI, which has been reworked for the tablet format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepared a video walktrough of the HTC Flyer UI for you. Enjoy!</paragraph>
