			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Powerful hardware, large high-res screen and the latest Android version in a solid metal body? the recipe did wonders for the original Desire so no wonder HTC are in no mood to experiment with the sequel. Take the best and make it better pretty much sums up the game plan. Oh well, we?ll take quietly brilliant even if emphasis is sometimes on quiet. In other words, the Desire S is a phone we?re ready to like. But make no mistake ? it?s not meant to be the flagship its predecessor was.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has the Sensation to send against the heavyweight competition. The new Desire is given a different, though no less important role. Ideally, it should be the smartphone that has broader appeal, the one to offer as reward to loyal upgraders. The phone to give you ? wait for it ? more bang for your buck than we?ve come expect from HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s what it puts on the table summarized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those coming from the original Desire will certainly notice the absence of the optical trackpad and that now capacitive keys replace the hardware buttons. It?s a different way of interacting with the phone but by no means less comfortable. Other than that, the new smartphone certainly does well to upgrade the original. You get more RAM, a slightly more compact and lighter body, which is still solid enough thanks to all the metal, along with the latest Android and a more powerful GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video-chat enthusiasts will cheer the front-facing camera, while those who want lots of apps installed on their smartphones will appreciate the extended built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is the Desire S is ? in more than one way ? running against the clock. A year is a really long time in cell phone terms and there?s no guarantee the updates are enough to make it competitive in a market that?s embracing dual-core and pushing beyond the 1GHz mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The easiest way to dispel the doubts would be to sail smooth through this review. So why wait ? unboxing coming up right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty decent retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S comes in a pretty small box, but it still has room for the essential accessories. There?s a socket charger, which needs a standard microUSB data cable to connect to the phone. Such cable is, of course, included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a headset with music controls. Unfortunately, it?s of the one-piece variety, meaning you can?t replace the headphones with third-party kit without losing the remote functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s adequate storage right out of the box, thanks to an 8GB microSD card, which was inserted in the handset itself. The usual paperwork was also here, but it?s nothing you cannot find online anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the HTC Desire S keeps the screen size of the original Desire and even throws in several new features, it manages to fit into an even more compact package. The difference is not quite prominent in width (59.8mm vs 60mm) and thickness (11.6mm vs 11.9mm), but the height has shed some 3mm, which is certainly not bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the weight has been reduced too, though marginally. At 130g, the HTC Desire S weighs 5g less than its predecessor. We do appreciate its solid build and quality feel though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S is a looker. With a large screen on the front and metal unibody for the rest you can?t really go wrong. Plus, we can trust HTC for a solidly build smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside is that it?s hard to really tell form a slew of recent HTC handsets. Still, the black color scheme and the subtly changed contour and controls below the screen are probably enough to make it stand out among its siblings. After all, there aren?t too many ways to design a touchscreen phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire S comes with a 3.7? S-LCD screen. And while you won?t get to experience any AMOLED blacks, you?d still get one of the better LCD screens in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the first of the HTC units worthy of the name Super LCD on the Incredible S and we are happy that the Desire S is treated to the same high-quality LCD. You get a display with punchy colors and very broad viewing angles. As far as LCD goes, image quality doesn?t get much better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only area where HTC still lags behind is sunlight legibility. The display isn't particularly bright and it's obviously pretty reflective so using the Desire S outside on a bright sunny day is not exactly an easy task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the results of our now traditional display brightness and contrast test. As you can see, the Desire S fares pretty decently against its peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to screen sensitivity, the Desire S performs just as you would expect a capacitive unit. The gentlest of taps do the trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, a video-call camera is right next to the earpiece above the display. There are also a couple of hidden sensors there ? proximity and ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find four capacitive keys. Frankly, we wouldn?t have minded regular keys like on the first Desire, but we?ve no reason to complain. The haptic enabled controls are well spaced and very responsive. Plus, the transition from the touchscreen is smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys (Home, Menu, back and search) have extra functionality upon a long-press (task switcher, virtual keyboard, voice search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no trackpad on the HTC Desire S. With the whole interface designed for touchscreen use it was redundant to begin with, probably only usable as a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The long and thin volume rocker and the microUSB port are on the phone?s left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the smartphone is perfectly bare with no controls or ports whatsoever. A camera key would have been nice, but we?re in no luck yet again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S rear features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the small loudspeaker grill. There is also a tiny LED flash but, as you know, you shouldn?t get your hopes too high for night photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back plate consists of three parts ? a metal piece in the middle and two parts of soft rubbery plastic either side. The upper one hosts the lens, flash and speaker, while the lower one opens to grant access to the card slots and the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we discovered that placing your hand over the top part of the back panel quickly deteriorates the Wi-Fi signal the Desire S is getting. You wouldn?t usually place your hand over there when you?re browsing the regular way in portrait mode, but when you switch to landscape grip, it?s quite easy to go for this death grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While with a strong Wi-Fi signal around, covering the back panel with your palm may only lower your download speed, with a more flimsy connection, it can stop a data transfer in its tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further down the back, we get to the battery cover. It?s a bit hard to slide the cover open and then undo the battery holder but it?s not a major flaw on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However to access the microSD slot you need to undo the battery holder. There?s nothing to keep the battery in place so you need to prop it with a finger unless you want to turn off your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1450mAh battery inside the HTC Desire S is quoted at up to 455 hours of stand-by or up to 9 hours and 50 minutes of talk time. In real life, it does pretty well. Our test unit gave us two full days of fairly heavy use (quite a bit of web browsing, the usual set of photos, a few minutes of calls and fiddling with the interface and testing the apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally the HTC Desire S is one of the best built smartphones we have seen recently. Its aluminum body is a joy to look at and handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there are only a few problems in terms of pure ergonomics too ? the lack of a dedicated camera key and the sub-par sunlight legibility are probably the biggest issues, but the rest of it seems fine. Pretty good marks overall for the HTC Desire S in the hardware department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We now move to the software part of this review. Starting on the next page, we're going to look into the nuts and bolts of a Sense-skinned Gingerbread Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI and Gingerbread out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire S is the first phone HTC release with Android 2.3 Gingerbread out of the box. The latest (this is not the Sense 3.0) version of HTC Sense UI brings two major improvements ? a Quick Settings tab in the Notification area and a revamped Main Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the surface, the HTC Sense is familiar enough, with some welcome refinements under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video demonstration of the HTC Desire S user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen, there are three virtual keys and a scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu. The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Personalize" menu. The latter contains various customization options for the display, homescreen and sound notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. With a press and hold you can rearrange the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense has Scenes enabled ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes at the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and can set different colors to various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, but you can switch to a list. In the list layout, there?s two-finger alphabet scrolling, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has been updated with the tabbed layout available in different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? all apps, frequent apps and favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Friend Stream widget for instance shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets. A third one is also available showing only your friends? status updates with no option to update yours. There's nothing stopping you from using all of them, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold on the Home button works too. It seems HTC has listened to users and decided to add another tab with switches for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is available almost everywhere. The Gingerbread implementation involves two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. Then you have Copy/Cut/Paste/Quick Lookup options. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S is one of the best single-core droids (until better ones come our way) and managed to play 720p Flash videos within the web browser hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled in the HTC Desire but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool things is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before shutting the down phone, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC has used some sort of Suspend or Hibernate logic as we know them from regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A phonebook with Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire S has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it used conversation style view, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turns the Desire S into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your friends? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Desire S. The Transfer Data app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dial a boost to telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Desire S has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire S knows three accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call or placing it down can activate the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very handy feature is that when someone calls, their latest Tweet or Facebook update will show up ? possibly reminding you what the caller has been up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Desire S fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Desire S are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input method that the Desire S offers is an on-screen QWERTY. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 3.7? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit. The HTC software keyboard is excellent too. Going landscape makes the keys and their spacing even larger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Desire S lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery we like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, one for Flickr. These two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Connected media button lets you pull multimedia content from a DLNA-enabled server (your PC with Windows Media Player will do just fine).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Desire S is very easy ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Desire S image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip layout (flip the phone horizontally and the accelerometer will take care of the rest). You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire S supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does DivX/XviD and even MKV, but has some limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files can be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface on the HTC Desire S offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through the video too. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - 720p MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled all of the D1 DivX videos and also most of the 720p XviD clips. It managed to play some MKVs up to 720p too, but half of them ran without sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes useful too ? the Desire S can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Songs and Connected media (which handles DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs or go back. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire S offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. From the context menu, you can share a song (over Bluetooth, email or message) and you can look up the music video on YouTube too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily recognizes a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire S is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S did better than the HTC Incredible S in our audio quality test. HTC still has some catching up to do before it matches the best on the market, but the Desire S represents a huge step forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone is quite good when you plug it in an active external amplifier (such as your home or car stereo), save for the higher than average (but hardly disturbing) stereo crosstalk. And given the excellent scores elsewhere and the high volume levels we are willing to let that go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that plugging in a pair of headphones doesn't have as disastrous an effect on stereo crosstalk as we have seen on some other smartphones. So even with its relatively low starting position it still ends up decent after the slide. However, the overall impact of the applied resistance is notable with frequency response and loudness both taking a hit, while the intermodulation distortion increases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still we feel that the overall performance of the Desire S deserves a good mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mediocre 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S packs a 5MP camera for stills of up to 2592x1952 pixel resolution. The phone does 720p videos @ 30fps too. There?s a single-LED flash, which can also be used as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom slider on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S features touch focus and face detection; geotagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus lets the camera focus as you reframe ? quite useful given the Desire S doesn?t have a proper shutter key and you can?t do that with the virtual shutter key either. The camera supports face detection too. It?s enabled in self-portrait mode too ? you can set it to focus on 1 or 2 faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we won't be able to properly judge the the HTC Desire S camera image quality as our unit has got a defective camera even though we snatched it off the retail chain. It's probably the lens that's faulty ? parts of all photos came out soft and smudgy and most interestingly, the blurry bits moved from one shot to the other. The defect is less prominent at close range as you'll see in the photo compare tool but it's still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the color rendering and contrast are good save for the somewhat visible noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the camera samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the Desire S had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in 3GP format which isn't the ideal container for HD video. We were surprised though by the video quality ? there is plenty of detail and good contrast. Colors are a bit over saturated and there are noticeable duplicated frames. We guess the hardware is struggling with the frame rate at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame rate of the videos is partly diasappointing. It's supposed to be 30 fps or so, but we found it to consistently be around 22fps. In action-packed scenes that produces jerkiness. Most of the cases you should be fine though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched 720p@30fps video clip (18MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Here?s how the HTC Desire S did in our Video Compare Tool database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Desire S in the Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 2.1. The Desire S has some Wi-Fi issues though. You will lose nearly 80% of your signal strength if you hold the phone around the camera lens. We did experience this ?death grip? issue only in landscape mode with a hand over the camera lens plating, but this is not much of an excuse. So you need to be careful if your Wi-Fi signal is weak and you are using the Desire S in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in the microUSB cable you?re presented with a long list of options - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable only ?allowed users? to connect or leave it open for anything (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser, plays HD Flash videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser. Some performance improvements are notable over the Froyo and Flash 10.2 is already out. The HTC desire S is taking full advantage of both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out yet more options ? anything from finding on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire S browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S comes with full Flash support and YouTube videos (up to 720p) played quite smoothly. We even decided to try out a few Flash games and they worked fine as well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire has similar hardware as the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc and Neo, but it?s the only one that can handle 720p videos within the browser. It seems HTC has done better optimizations than Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say what you will about Flash, but still most video streaming and game sites use it ? so it?s a major advantage for a browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Desire S, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quickoffice app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents (but not 2007 docs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a Word document, you get plenty of formatting options (more than you get on Windows Phone 7). You get text effects (italic, bold, etc.), you can change the font and its size, color and highlight (from a color picker, not just 3 pre-selected colors like in WP7).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when you tap Format, you get a long list with all the options in it ? usable but not quite user friendly. You can?t create tables (or edit existing ones) or lists either. The situation with spreadsheets is similar ? enough features, but not presented in the most user-friendly way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Desire S into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into places, like Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also comes preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geotagged, you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app (uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic) and there are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two handy search apps Quick lookup and Search Anywhere. Quick lookup lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary. The Search Anywhere app is a universal in-phone search that covers anything ? from settings and messages to songs and videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>eBooks as wellM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Reader app is an eBook reader provided by Kobo. It comes preloaded with several classics (from A Tale of Two Cities to White Fang) and access to Kobo?s eBook store where you can buy new books (the store has free titles too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is fairly simple ? the library displays as a list of book-cover thumbs or as a simple list. Once you tap a cover, it opens up the book for you with a nice animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reader formats the book to best fit the screen and you can adjust the font. You can add bookmarks, highlight sections of the book with different colors and even jot down notes ? you can access those in the context menu while reading the book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background is pure white, which means it glows with the full strength of the backlight, which quickly becomes a problem and tires your eyes. A choice of background colors would have been nice, as well as an easy to reach control of the backlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we missed is the option to import e-books you already have ? like classic books from Project Guttenberg for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, some will find the Reader app useful, others can just grab Kindle for Android from the Market or one of the other free eBook readers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market, but each one comes with an HTC review. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Desire S contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Desire S in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Navigate the Google or the HTC way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a minute and 10 seconds (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire S also comes with HTC Places, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse. Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The car panel offers big, easy to hit buttons so that you don?t get too distracted while driving. A handy option is ?mark this location? ? great for those who often forget where they parked their car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you take the plunge and pay extra for the voice-guided navigation, the HTC Desire S can very successfully double s a SatNav unit. The screen is big enough and has broad viewing angles but sunlight legibility is less than perfect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we first made its acquaintance, the HTC Desire S was on display at this year?s MWC in Barcelona along with the Incredible S and the Wildfire S. Each phone in this trio is no more perhaps than a transitional model, a facelift that doesn?t even warrant their own name. A bone to throw to upgraders to get them off your back while you?re busy making the next big thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, let?s get this out of the way. We know already the Sensation is HTC?s next big thing. Dual-core is the buzz word in high-end smartphones. The HTC Sensation and the EVO 3D will be leading the line against the likes of the LG Optimus 2X, the Samsung Galaxy S II and the Motorola Atrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 2X ? Samsung Galaxy S II ? Motorola Atrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Desire S will be seeing no premier league action. But that?s not necessarily a bad thing. The way we see it, the Incredible S is more likely to rub shoulders with the dual-cores and end up bruised. The Desire S looks like the handset with the better prospects. It?s friendlier and more compact, and still strong enough to handle competition in its own category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the name and looks of it, it?s supposed to succeed the Desire, but it?s a more than legitimate upgrade of the Legend too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire S is HTC?s first handset natively running Android v.2.3 Gingerbread. Traditionally it has the latest Sense UI ? a winning combination by the books of every loyal HTC user. The HTC Desire S is powered by the Snapdragon chipset with a 1GHz Scorpion processor and Adreno 205 graphics. The Incredible S, Desire HD, Sony Ericsson?s latest XPERIA quartet (Play, Arc, Neo and Pro) and more are based on the same platform. And the Desire S won?t be embarrassed by comparisons to any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the alternatives in the very HTC camp. The Incredible S and the Desire HD are both worth your thought if you need a bigger screen and a better imaging. They still run Android v2.2 Froyo, but will get a Gingerbread update later this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Incredible S ? HTC Desire HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has a number of Gingerbread-powered droids to choose from. While the XPERIA Arc is out of the reach of the Desire S, the XPERIA Neo will readily fight it out for the users? favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Samsung Galaxy S is in line to get its official Gingerbread update and you might want to give its SuperAMOLED screen a thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a casual glance, the HTC Desire S doesn?t seem to hold a lot of promise especially if you consider that the original Desire will get Gingerbread ? and we guess there are enough of them already running unofficial ROMs. On the other hand though, the Desire S is a reasonable option for upgraders coming from the Legend too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design may be a bit played out, but this is still one of the prettiest and best build droids out there. The screen falls short of the Retinas and Super AMOLEDs of the world, but it?s among the best in its class. And 3.7? is still considered by many to be the perfect screen size. The poor imaging is the big issue in the otherwise spotless performance, but with HTC it?s almost part of the charm.</paragraph>
