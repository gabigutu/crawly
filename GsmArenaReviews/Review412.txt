			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K510 is a new tri-band bar phone with the classic Sony Ericsson K-series design. It will be sold at a reasonable price and as far as our impressions go it would become a price/performance champion. The tri-band GSM 1.3 megapixel camera phone will be labeled K510i for the European market, K510a for the Americas and K510c for China Mainland.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K510 comes in the upper lower class of mobile phones and is aimed for every day use of people who want functionality and reliability from their phones. It's neither a luxurious piece nor a powerful device. The phone offers very good camera performance for its class, good connectivity features and very fast response in such small dimensions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The regular Sony Ericsson bar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K510 looks just like a normal Sony Ericsson bar phone and cannot surprise in terms of design and construction. The size of 101 x 44 x 17 mm and the weight of 82 g make it a rather small device and when held in hand it feels very comfortable and easy to operate with. The black and silver combination is elegant and suits the phone's shape very nicely. However, the design of the phone cannot mislead you to think that K510 is an expensive phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson K510 front, bottom and top</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction of the phone is very solid and stable. It did not produce a single creak or any other sound during the testing period. It feels very comfortable in one hand and the proportions of the phone are perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  K510 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front side of the phone is made out of black plastic and the four functional keys and the navigation joystick stand out with their silver color. The main speaker is located at the top with a Sony Ericsson sign found just below it. A silver line frame designates the display and below it is the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the use of joystick for navigation can be a reason for many protests from disgruntled clients. The infamous SE joysticks tend to gradually stop working in the course of using the phone for let say a year. Sony Ericsson realized the fact and is trying to improve their design in order to seal the joystick from dirt and dust which actually lead to its short life fate. Many users think that the company should start producing their handsets with 4-way navigation pad instead with a joystick but truth is that the joystick is incredibly comfortable means of navigation? as long as it works, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two soft keys and the Back (on the left) and clear C (on the right) buttons surround the navigation joystick. Below them are located the numeric keys. The four silver keys and the joystick are made out of plastic while the numeric keys are made out of some different rubber-like material.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover features the camera lens and the self-portrait mirror, all located on a bulging silver ring. The rest of the back is black. The camera lens is located rather deep in the phone construction, probably for protecting it from scratches. Below the camera balloon is the speaker grid, which is in an interesting form. There is also a vertical Sony Ericsson sign embedded on the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The phone's front and back</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both lateral sides are silver and have one button on each of them. The left side shelters the camera release button. On the right side is the Activity menu button. Unfortunately, this time the design lacks the traditional side volume swing key and that may turn out as a bit of disappointment for all Sony Ericsson fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> K510 right side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover opens easily when you push it upwards in its bottom part. When you lose the cover, the Lithium-Polymer battery is visible, covering the SIM card bed beneath it. Sony Ericsson deserve compliments for supplying the phone with such a good battery. According to the manufacturer, it should provide the handset with 360 hours of standby time and 7 hours of talk time. Of course those numbers are strictly indicative. Pitifully, we couldn't test the K510 battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone. Unfortunately, there is no memory card slot in the Sony Ericsson K510.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fixed positions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS maniacs won't be disappointed from the keypad of K510. It is easy to control and typing goes natural. Regrettably, the two soft keys on the top of the keypad are with fixed functions and cannot be assigned anything else. The left key is reserved for the Calls log and answering phone calls as the right one is a shortcut to the Menu and rejecting phone calls. A press on the joystick also takes you in the Menu and that's why it's such a pity that the soft keys cannot be re-assigned. But that's standard for Sony Ericsson phones menu system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right lateral button brings the Activity menu on the display. This menu consists of three tabs: My Shortcuts, Bookmarks and New events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Activity menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bad thing is that the backlighting of the keypad is not very good. It glows unevenly and leaves the keypad hardly visible in the dark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Beware of the sun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has a 262K color TFT display offering a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. It performs well when indoors or under poor lighting conditions but when it's exposed in direct sunlight it becomes very illegible. The backlighting of the display is also not among the best ones. On top of that, there is no option for changing the backlighting time of the display and the preset period is very short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Display backlighting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When active, the display shows the network cell status, the battery status, the operator name, time and date and the Calls and Menu labels of the soft keys. The display can run animated wallpapers. When the display is inactive, it goes off but you can set a clock to be displayed. However, it is hardly visible in any conditions. You can also set a screen saver picture which will be displayed for some time after the display goes inactive and then it will go off too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, we were quite pleased by the quality of the sound during conversations. The microphone is really sensitive and gave us no troubles - even in noisy streets the other party was able to hear us speaking. The loudspeaker is also loud enough and we must point out that according to us it?s even louder than the one used in Sony Ericsson K800 which is far superior to K510 in many ways. All in all, we?ve seen louder phones, but this one does its job more than satisfactory. During conversations you can use the loudspeaker too allowing you to talk while the handset is away from you. That worked well but there?s more to wish for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calling ? In-call menu ? loudspeaker switched on</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 6 predefined profiles which can be freely edited to the user preferences. A fast shortcut key for changing the current profile is the short press of the ON/OFF button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Need for speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K510 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. The main menu is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated and zooming-in icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs incredibly fast in every submenu and application. Even the camera and picture viewer applications work very fast. It has 28 MB internal memory and due to lack of a memory card slot it cannot be used as a music phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The main menu ? listed sub-menu ? event animations</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several repetitions of applications and shortcuts in the menus, which can be confusing for some users. The logical positions of the applications are not always present and the untrained users might need some time to get used to the K510 menu system. There are four available graphic themes on the phone. They change the color scheme and the wallpaper. More are available for download, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Different graphic themes</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1000 entries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. It displays only the contacts from the phone memory. SIM card contacts are accessible from a sub-menu. When you browse the phonebook it displays as much as 5 contacts at a time. Switching between different phone numbers and emails for a given contact is possible via pushing the side ways of the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Changing contact's number, email and web address</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts. They can be separated in groups which, however, cannot be used as call filters. When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. You cannot add more than those five numbers. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth, tab is for additional information and birthday date. When you add the birthday date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder of it. That's a good feature and we like it that we see it available more and more often in current phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Adding new contact ? Photo call</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the Autosave on SIM feature, which is common for Sony Ericsson models. It is also a very useful feature for those who change phones often. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Phonebook is searched through gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Who was that?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text, picture or voice?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. There is a My Friends feature which works like an instant messaging application and can be used if your network operator supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Messaging menu ? Inbox ? Drafts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing a message, first you must choose from the three variants: Text message, Picture message or Voice message. I don't see the point in this as you can easily transform a SMS into a MMS along the way. There is an option to attach objects to the message and thus turn into a MMS. The editor shows up to 5 lines en bloc. There is a character counter which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. When you pass the limit a "2 SMS" warning sign comes up for a second to alert you that the message will be divided in two parts. Of course, there is T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Writing SMS ? reading SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols. It can also manage several accounts simultaneously. You can choose from downloading only headers or headers and text. There are many options available for the check interval, you can set it to check from every 5 minutes to 12 hours or disable the automatic check at all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Definitely not a jukebox<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K510 supports MP3, WAV, MP4, AAC, AMR, MIDI file formats. The media player has an equalizer with several options and can manage Playlists. It also plays both music and video files. It can be set to run in background so you can do other things on the phone while listening to music. The control of the player is intuitive, it can be controlled via the joystick and that makes it really easy. Regrettably, there are only basic features implemented in this application.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One of the best cameras in its market class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera of K510 is of very good quality for such price. The camera capabilities of mobile phones are developing very fast as only an year ago Sony Ericsson S700 with its 1.3 megapixel camera was considered as one of the best camera phones available and now K510 makes pictures at least as good as S700 but at a far lower price tag. This performance is a very good strike for this price range. The camera has Night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, burst features. Several color effects are available too. There is no LED flash, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   View finder ? menu options ? no zoom in 1.3 MP mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>              Sony Ericsson K510 sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with K510 are with low resolution but the phone makes bigger files with less compression artifacts than other models with similar cameras. The picture viewer of the phone allows horizontal mode. Regrettably, the pictures cannot be zoomed in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Shooting video ? video options</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NetFront Browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of Sony Ericsson K510 is the Access NetFront Web browser which has become a standard for currents SE phones.. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. Supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, the display does not allow exploring the full abilities of the browser. There is a Smart-fit feature of the browser for resizing the web page to be visible on the display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Time planners<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar and Alarms have separate icons in the main menu but the Calendar is not listed in the Organizer sub-menu. It has month and week view. As we have mentioned above, when you add a birthday date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer menu ? Calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be created for two reasons: as Tasks and as Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are two alarms - a single one and a repeated one. Not long ago, SE phones lacked recurrent alarms so it's nice to see that feature implemented here. The calculator is very simple and lacks complex features. The synchronization is for connecting with an internet server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Setting a task ? alarms menu ? alarm settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 3 applications more available - FaceWarp is used for manipulating portrait shots by adding funny faces and grimaces. NewsReader is a RSS feeds reader which is very useful. World Clock shows the time in different parts of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Applications menu ? NewsReader</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we've said above, there are some misleading parts in the user interface of Sony Ericsson K510. Some icons and applications can seen more than once in the menu and some of them seems to be put in illogical places. As the Calendar is not in the Organizer menu and the Alarms have two icons, the Camera pictures have separate icon in the main menu. Of course, they can also be accessed from the File manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera pictures ? File manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File manager works very fast in every aspect. It manages all the files of the phone and every multimedia file can be player or opened from it without any delay. As a standard feature it allows creation of user folders as well as marking, copying and moving of files among the folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications can also be found on the phone. Those are the VideoDJ, PhotoDJ and MusicDJ, Remote Control and Voice Recorder. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch using special transition effects and even by adding background music. It's a very amusing application. PhotoDJ is for applying effects on images and MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating polyphonic melodies. The Remote Control application is for controlling a PC via Bluetooth. The Voice Recorder allows for unlimited recording and needs no commentary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Entertainment menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time eaters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two games preinstalled: MiniGolfBT and QuadraPop. The MiniGolfBT is a rather irritating Golf sport game. QuadraPop is a Tetris-like game which can be rather amusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  MiniGolfBT ? QuadraPop</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only at a reasonable price<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone has some advantages to offer and can manage to find its way through the market. The small size of a phone with such good 1.3 megapixel camera, lightning fast interface, great web browser and fair connectivity options can compensate the lack of memory card slot and the poor display. With the reasonable price put by the manufacturer, there is no doubt that Sony Ericsson K510 will have lots of fans and satisfied customers.</paragraph>
