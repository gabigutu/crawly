			<paragraph>Motorola has launched a new leader. The popular RAZR is being substituted by the new KRZR, whose glossy materials look luxurious. On the other hand, the innovations made since the forerunner are very few. Is this wrong? Not at all, provided all you need is a new pretty toy.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>   Motorola KRZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For more than two years now Motorola has been successfully selling its original slim model Motorola RAZR. It was the first manufacturer to use an etched keypad mounted into a clamshell of the unbelievable thickness of 15 mm. Nowadays, the market offers a variety of phones of similar features, see Motorola?s direct competitor the Ultra Edition by Samsung, so the time for a new fighter has apparently come. Have a look at Motorola KRZR!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   All side-view </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Magnesium taste<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The entire name of Motorola?s new model is Motorola KRZR K1. I personally find it as unattractive and soundless as the names HTC has recently been using (STRTrk, MTeoR etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since numerous users expressed dissatisfaction with RAZR?s width (they found the phone too wide), Motorola has narrowed its new KRZR by more than 1 cm. The result is that the new clamshell is far more comfortable to hold in hand. On the other side, KRZR is 5 mm longer and 2 mm thicker than its forerunner ? a difference you might not even notice if both models are not placed side by side. The exact size of Motorola KRZR is: 103 x 42 x 16 mm and it weighs 102 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; The phone held in hand ? size comparison to a credit card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I must confess that I was really happy to be able to take pictures of Motorola KRZR. It has plenty to show: its top half is all covered with mineral glass said to protect from scratches for a longer time than usual (not tested though). The surface is glossy; dark blue, with violet nuances under particular light conditions; it suits it really well. After having made an inquiry among its clients Motorola proclaimed that ?blue is the new black?- a highly true statement in the case of KRZR. In fact, the phone looks even more attractive in reality than in pictures due to its feature to reflect surrounding objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Front cover reflects surrounding objects ? dark blue suits KRZR really well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Motorola KRZR looks quite loaded/equipped</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, beauty comes at the expense of the legibility of the external display, even if miracles could hardly be expected from a display that is not only passive but also hidden behind a ?mirror?. The external display is 19 mm wide and 16 mm high and supports 65K colors (some Motorola sources say 262K). Direct sunlight makes it fully illegible leaving the user without a single detail about the state of the phone. Visualization in the dark looks better, but even here white seems rather grey and color saturation is low. The last con to mention regards fingerprints ? Motorola KRZR requires frequent cleaning. According to the information we obtained at the press conference held after the phone had been launched, the retail package contains a cleaning cloth. However, we cannot confirm this information as we received only the device itself. On the left, above the external display you will see an icon indicating charging; on the right there is a Bluetooth indicator. When the phone is not active, both indicators remain invisible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feels like velvet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few seconds after the phone has been closed wallpaper identical to the one on the main display also appears on the external display. This includes a digital clock plus details about signal strength and battery state. As soon as the display switches to an energy-save mode (after approximately 1/2 minute of inactivity), a monochrome digital clock is the only indicator that remains visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now get back to the phone construction, which is quite interesting. The entire body of the phone is braced up with a light, solid magnesium-made rim. The entire rear panel is made of soft-touch material, which feels like a combination of velvet and rubber. I find it hard to explain, so you?d better call by a mobile phone shop and try it yourself; it is a material that does not slip out of your palm or catches fingerprints. At the same time the panel above the battery is all made of aluminum; it is extremely thin and sticks well to the back of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rear cover is pleasant to touch and does not attract dirt almost at all ? the battery cover is made of aluminum </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back panel you will find a Lithium-Ion battery with capacity of 700 mAh. The officially presented battery life is as follows: 300 hours of stand-by or 360 minutes of call time. Unfortunately, we had the KRZR for too short time to be able to verify the above mentioned times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a removed rear cover </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid bottom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the battery, hidden behind the back panel, is also the SIM card bed. Above it you will also find an untraditionally positioned microSD memory card slot. The SIM card can only be picked out if the battery has been removed first, while the memory card is fully hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> SIM card bed ? the microSD memory card is inserted above the SIM card </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The joint of the clamshell looks solid enough to ensure long-lasting usage. Both opening and closing are facilitated by springs, which push the top half down to its lock position. An interlock located beneath the keypad is meant to protect the display from scratches when the phone is being closed, but partly fails to do so, as imprints of the keys are visible on the display anyway. Fortunately, a bit of polishing is enough to make them disappear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; The joint of the KRZR clamshell is solid and precisely elaborated</paragraph>
			<paragraph>End-stop for the top half</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another element Motorola KRZR has inherited from its forerunners is the expressed bottom, the ?chin?, into which the top half of the clamshell interlocks when the phone is closed. It is no wonder Motorola has once again used this element as it allows for a far longer body than in the case of standard covering of the keypad and the display areas. Besides, when one speaks, a little bit more of solid material in front of their mouth feels more natural. Parts of the overall elegant design of the phone are two decorative end caps on either side of the joint in the form of two silver circles with blue stones. The band covered with dots around the above mentioned ?chin? is another interesting detail. To sum up, in terms of construction, comfort and solidness Motorola KRZR is undoubtedly one of the best mobile devices on the market (not only clamshells).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fingers will be grateful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola has once again chosen the etched keypad, perfect for slim phones. In front of me I have both V3 and KRZR, so let?s compare them. The keypad of Motorola KRZR appears to be remade a bit in order to make typing even more comfortable. Keys? uplift is slightly higher than in the original RAZR, while distribution is more practical, not to say moderate. A shortkey for instant opening of the web browser as well as a correction back-key are available too, just like in Motorola V3x. This new Motorola keypad is comfortable indeed. Its deep blue backlighting is superb and perfectly even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Remade keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad backlighting </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of Motorola KRZR there is a voice control key, which also opens the voice recorder after a longer press. Records duration only depends on the available free internal memory. A bit lower you will see a miniUSB connector with an attached soft plastic cap. On the opposite side are the dual volume-control key and the so called ?Smart Key?, to which any function from the menu can be assigned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Activation of the voice control and the voice recorder ? the Smart Key with the dual volume-control button ? miniUSB connector </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the main display has changed in accordance with the modifications of the entire phone body. It has a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels on a surface of 30 x 38 mm and supports 256K colors. Both contrast and legibility are superb. The lower resolution is hard to notice, unless one focuses on the smoothness of the menu font. On the other hand, there are certain sections in the menu, like the camera application for example, where text aliasing is unpleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Display surface has been modified ? main display in the dark </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is place for improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am going to repeat myself, but I cannot skip one important fact: Motorola is one of the manufacturers who stubbornly refuse to modify (read improve) the years-old interface of its models. I do not want to say it is the worst of all, but there are plenty of details that cry for improvement, the menu structure in particular. Interface design is another questionable matter; on one hand Motorola provides users with numerous options for menu configuration, on the other hand, however, designers could have done better job with the respective icons, references and logs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper on the main display can be of any type, incl. animated. Further, you can choose between an analog and a digital clock, or simply none. The operator?s name as well as the current date could be centered or aligned to right. The center of the display can also be occupied by graphic icons of the functions assigned to the ways of the navigation key. The context keys and the above mentioned ?Smart Key? could also be assigned any function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My keys (settings)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is user-configurable. It can be visualized as a list or as a 9-element matrix. Items? order is also configurable. What the phone will not allow you is to move in the menu by using numeric shortcuts. The speed, with which Motorola KRZR responds to orders, is rather average; it sometimes makes you wait even longer than a smartphone would, Motorola V3x was faster, for example. Graphic themes for modification of the menu looks are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   &nbsp; Three preset themes </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Holding Motorola KRZR during phone calls is a nice experience. Its microphone is located in the middle of the ?chin?, beneath the keypad, so any difference in the usage of the phone between left-handers and right-handers become irrelevant. The opposite call party can hear you well; the sound coming out of the earphones is natural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microphone in the middle of the "chin" </paragraph>
			<paragraph>All sounds created by Motorola KRZR come out from a speaker located on the back of its body; volume levels are average. Motorola KRZR does not belong among the loudest devices, but on the other hand, no sound distortion can be heard no matter how high the volume is set. Bass elements are missing as usual; highs are ok. Unfortunately, we are not able to verify the quality of the sound of Motorola KRZR?s headset as we were delivered the handset only; we do not have another pair of Motorola earphones in our office, either. As you may know, recently Motorola has been promoting a series of Bluetooth solutions (the KRZR model supports the wireless A2DP). We strongly believe, however, that a standard jack will also be available as this will make users independent from company headsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Loud speaker grill on the back </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers five ringing profiles that help you modify ringtones and sound alerts. Two of the profiles include vibration ? one of them alerts with vibration only, while the other one uses ringing and vibration simultaneously. Volume levels are setup separately by the respective side keys. Each volume modification is accompanied by a rather disturbing sound effect typical for Motorola phones. Ringing profiles can be switched by using the side keys even when the phone is closed; all necessary information is available on the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing profile settings </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>V3x?s phonebook was good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone offers two forms of contact visualization: a standard name list, in which each contact is always accompanied by a tiny icon symbolizing the corresponding default number (dialed directly with a single press on the green key), or a group of maximum 3 simultaneously displayed contacts, each of which is attached not only a default number icon, but also the number itself and a mini-image. The vertical ways of the navigation key serve for contact browsing, while the horizontal ones are used for browsing the numbers and the emails assigned to each name. You can also send a message or an email to a selected contact straight from the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Phonebook ? searching by gradual typing ? contact details </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a name, a last name, a nickname, seven phone numbers, two emails, two websites, two detailed street addresses, a birth date, an image, and a specific ringtone. Individual items (their type is user-configurable) can be added when necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is searched by gradual typing of the initial letters of the desired contact. Groups are available too. Use the asterisk or the hash key to switch from one group to another (KRZR has copied this option from the better equipped Motorola V3x. Numbers stored on the SIM card constitute a separate group. Nevertheless, the phonebook shows the contacts from the SIM card and the phone memory all together. There is also a folder called ? Email?, which stores all contacts featuring an electronic address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Group browsing </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too. Press the respective button on the right side of the phone body and pronounce the name of the person you want to call. The phonebook offers a capacity for 1000 names.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages &amp; emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR offers plenty of messaging options. Along with standard SMS it is able to send out EMS, MMS, and emails. When you create a new message, you will run across a new concept first launched in the E1070 model: the phone does not ask you what type of message you are to write, but selects it automatically according to the message contents. In a similar way the editor switches automatically from SMS to MMS format when more than 3 sub-messages (3 x 160 characters) have been written. The concept is not bad at all but requires a bit of getting used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Message editor ? received messages ? details of a received message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages are both created and read on 6 lines en bloc. When a SMS is being typed, characters are counted in ascending order. The total number of created sub-messages appears on the display shortly before you send your message out. As usual, Motorola offers an iTap dictionary. The version applied in the KRZR model knows all frequently used words; it is fast and truly helpful. The dictionary could be deactivated if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Browsing the messages in the phone memory and those on the SIM card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose to create a MMS, select ?Insert? in the context menu and find the respective object in one of the available multimedia folders. You can insert images, sounds and videos or possibly create any of this yourself. The phone can store an infinite number of SMS and MMS as long as the shared memory (21 MB) allows it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The variety of message types is limited ? writing a SMS ? inserting an object in a MMS ? options after the red key has been pressed </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are created separately. The phone manages multiple accounts simultaneously via the POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. You can set the phone to check for emails automatically in certain time intervals or do so manually. In any case, the application asks you to decide which mode you prefer every time you enter the folder with received messages. You can reply to messages, forward them, and work with multimedia attachments. Full-resolution pictures taken with the built-in camera can be sent out as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not even macro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you could observe, nearly all functions and elements in Motorola KRZR detailed in the first half of our review look or work as in the older RAZR models. One of the few improvements here is the higher resolution of KRZR?s camera. The original VGA was raised to one megapixel in Motorola V3i; in Motorola KRZR there are already 2 megapixels. By writing this I do not mean that Motorola KRZR?s camera is better than the cameras of the forerunners. Just on the contrary - the pictures it takes are miserable compared to the competitors?. Convince yourself by having a look at the following samples in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera lens is located beneath a glass; it has no LED</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sample photos in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To take a picture you need to hold the phone in a vertical position. The pictures above are presented in their original. The center of the main navigation key serves as a shutter release button. The basic camera-control interface is designed smartly: its transparency allows the shot image to appear in a full-screen mode (not valid for the video application, whose menu is 100% non-transparent)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera interface ? basic setup provided with the main control key is easy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Zoom consists of 8 steps; it creates crops only</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR takes well focused pictures as long as shot objects are situated at a mid-distance. Remote objects come out badly; areas of similar colors pour one into another. Exposure compensation and white balancing work well. Camera?s setup options can be seen in the following three pictures ? exposure compansetion is set to minimum, automatic and maximum settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extreme features of the exposure compensation: -2 ? 0 ? +2 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers several white balance settings such as automatic, sunny, cloudy, indoor (at home), indoor (office), and night. A video record can be shot without a problem too ? its 3GP format and a maximum resolution of 352 x 288 pixels are common for most new cameraphones. Resulting videos look well enough in the phone but are virtually useless for work on a PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   &nbsp;A demonstration of color filters available in the camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Text came out bad</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola doesn?t get it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, Motorola KRZR has no connector for wire earphones. It is not only the connector though. Its MP3 player deserves critical remarks too. The latter is fully illogical. As usual, it can be opened from the folder ?Games and applications?; has new design and is generally good (it orders files by artists or albums). On the other hand, it does not play when minimized. So we kept on searching throughout the phone until we found out that MP3 files could also be played straight from a folder called ?Sounds?. And here, out of a sudden, they did play even if minimized...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Java player cannot be minimized </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Song details ? setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this folder you can also create tabs, among which you switch by pressing the asterisk and the hash keys. Of course, individual files can be grouped into playlists, which then can be sorted by genres into the above mentioned tabs. The player menu features Repeat, but lacks Shuffle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Player runs seamlessly when minimized but continues to manage files with difficulties </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the player is running in background, the stand-by display shows the name of the running song instead of the usual data. The horizontal ways of the navigation key are used for fast forwarding and rewinding of the tracks. Volume levels are controlled via keys on the side of the handset. Naturally, the music player runs when the phone is closed too. In such case, song names appear on the tiny external display. To switch between songs with the phone closed use the corresponding side key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound player minimized </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer, Internet and other extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alarm clock appears on the first position in the Tools menu. You can set several alarms at different times. Text notes are also available, due to which the alarm clock could be used as a ?reminder? too. The best reminder, however, is the calendar. Here you can insert events with assigned duration time, alarm, and repetition. The calendar has a monthly, weekly and a daily view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;A list of alarm clocks ? settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly ? weekly ? and daily view in the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Creating a new event</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting extra is the calculator with an integrated unit converter. Motorola KRZR lacks timer functions. The phone supports Java in 2.0 version. It has an Internet browser originally designed to open WAP pages and it does so seamlessly. The display shows information on 8 lines en bloc. The browser manages to open web sites, but the font size does not get fully adjusted to the size of the display and simple sites are rarely entirely visualized. Let me mention, however, that we have tested one of the first released models. The firmware of the officially sold phones may turn out to be better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone is used as a modem, data for the Internet browser of your PC is transferred via GPRS and EDGE Class 12. Motorola KRZR connects to PC through Bluetooth or a USB cable. Let us remind you that the phone has a standard miniUSB connector, so you should have no problem to find a cable for a few bucks, provided you have not already obtained one in the retail package of your digital camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Slot for a regular miniUSB cable </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Too few improvements...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola KRZR has perfect design. Naturally, users are free to have their own tastes, but one thing is for sure: this phone is going to become popular for its look more than anything else. The materials used in it are very good. Its overall ?visage? is miles away from triviality. Motorola KRZR is going to sell well thanks to its face, not its functions. KRZR is a babe, who loves tabloids and luxurious parties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now sum up: Motorola has made a high-quality handset with original design and very good phonebook. Its time organizer is perfect. USB Mass Storage support and the comfortable keypad are strong advantages too. The pity is that Motorola has only improved its aged user interface by few elements from the V3x model leaving plenty of details untouched: the built-in camera is bad, the external display is rather poor, and once again you will find two music players, none of which is really efficient.</paragraph>
