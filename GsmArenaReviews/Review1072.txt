		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Light at the end of the tunnel or the tunnel of light at the end. Nokia is near the point where it couldn't care less - as long as the dark days are finally over for a company, which used to drive an entire industry forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia must hardly be enjoying life after Symbian and it shows. The fact is that the Finns have nothing but Ashas and the most basic of S30 phones between the last Windows Phone flagship and the next. The PureView 808 was a flash of brilliance - like the N9 before it - but just that. And a dwindling army of fans still holds on to the memory of a Nokia that was as prolific as it was talented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not the best of times then for the Finns, but the right time for a flagship to show its worth. Saying that the future of the company is being decided here is probably too much. But the Lumia 920 could be the difference between living with dignity and scratching a living on emerging markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The holiday season and the first months of 2013 are a make or break time for Nokia, and if those early reports of the phone being sold-out are anything to go by, the Lumia 920 already managed to get a few victories under its belt. It?s going to be a long campaign though and we're yet to see if the new flagship has what it takes to help Nokia get back where they want to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia may have made all kinds of mistakes in the past couple of years, but the innovation well hasn't obviously dried up. The Lumia 920 features a lot of firsts for both company and industry, the most impressive of which are the optical image stabilization and the PureMotionHD+ display. Wireless charging is more than welcome too though, technically, Palm beat the Finns to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touchscreen that can be operated with gloves sounds exciting enough, but Nokia claims there's more to the new Lumia screen. There are promises of excellent brightness and outdoor visibility, as well as increased responsiveness and smoother scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset might not be a benchmark blaster, but WP devices have consistently demonstrated they need a lot less horsepower to give a smooth ride through the UI. Of course, heavier apps may tend to load a bit slower, but we shouldn't be expecting lags or stutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's cut the speculation and get down to actual testing. The unboxing and hardware inspection are up next.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920's retail package is a pretty standard affair. Inside the moderately-sized box you'll find a USB cable, an A/C adapter and a headset of slightly higher quality than what most of the Lumia 920 competitors typically have. It's nowhere near though the Beats headphones that some HTC smartphones used to come with in the early days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items inside the box are the SIM eject tool and a bunch of leaflets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 920 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 measures 130.3 x 70.8 x 10.7 mm, which probably doesn't mean much on paper, but this is the first smartphone in quite a while that has us wondering whether some lines have actually been crossed, in terms of size, weight and comfortable use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By comparison, the LG Optimus G fits a larger 4.7" screen of the same aspect in a body that's only a tad taller, but both narrower and slimmer. The Samsung Galaxy S III has an even bigger 4.8" screen, and the difference in body size is negligible compared to the difference in screen size (4.5-inch for the Lumia 920).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three phones are pretty much the same size, with both LG and Samsung droids taller, but none of them has made us worry about or question the comfort of use. The Lumia 920 on the other hand instantly looks like the heaviest of the bunch - which it actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 weighs 185g, which is about the weight of a Nokia communicator - if anyone remembers those. Don't get us wrong, we are all for the great build and solid feel but the Nokia flagship is heavier than a Galaxy Note II, which comes with a 5.5" screen, a 3100 mAh battery and the S Pen tucked inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the optical image stabilization alone contributes toward both the size and weight but thickness aside, the screen bezel is a bit too wide. Anyway, just make sure the Lumia 920 is something you can actually handle. This one is definitely not for every pocket, or hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there's one thing that can make you forgive the Nokia Lumia 920's less than stellar use of the available space, it's the build and finish. The Lumia 920 looks and feels every bit the flagship part, with the polycarbonate unibody and the curved display working extremely well together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to say if the Nokia Lumia 920 is the best looking smartphone out there, but it's certainly in the running. Plus there are quite a few interesting colors to pick from - there's the classic black that feels grown-up and to-the-point, but also the fresh looking Yellow, White and Red paintjobs for those after a more expressive style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not just about the looks either. The non-painted unibody is built to last and even when you scratch it, the same color polycarbonate appears underneath, so it's way harder to spot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 comes with a brand new PureMotionHD+ display, which is certainly one of the smartphone's key selling points. Nokia has obviously invested a lot of effort in its development and it has quite a lot to show for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, this is the first capacitive touchscreen flagship to support operation with gloves, which might make the flagship smartphone a favorite of winter sports fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the higher than regular refresh rate, which should make scrolling text smoother than ever, though to be honest, we are yet to spot the real-life advantages of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second generation ClearBlack display does pretty well in terms of image image quality - the Lumia 920 display has nice colors and moderately deep blacks. It can't quite match the perfect blacks of AMOLED in complete darkness, but due to its low reflectivity, it's a good performer in everything from moderately-lit to bright environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are quite good too and while there's notable brightness loss when you go to extremes, everything on the screen remains legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Nokia Lumia 920 did in our dedicated display tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia flagship showed good contrast in the first one, and while its sunlight legibility isn't class leading, it's enough to enable relatively trouble-free use outdoors even on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a shot of the Lumia 920 display matrix from our microscope. You can clearly notice the density advantage over the Lumia 820.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft keeps a pretty tight control over the hardware of Windows Phone devices, so understandably the Lumia 920 brings little surprises here. Above the screen you will find the earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the 720p front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three touch-sensitive buttons for getting around the Windows Phone 8 UI. These are probably the most generously spaced capacitive keys in business. That and the extra space below them will be much appreciated for allowing an extra solid grip of that big and heavy handset. Two-thumb typing in landscape is quite comfortable and the thicker phone body allows a secure hold. So really, what's a disadvantage in terms of good looks, actually works in favor of comfortable handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is absolutely nothing on the phone's left side but things get a lot busier on the right. The volume rocker is there, along with the power/lock key and a dedicated camera button. The latter would launch the camera even if the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top you get the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the microSIM tray. You'll need the SIM eject tool supplied in the retail package or another suitable sharp object to release the tray, but that's often the case with microSIM-packing devices, so we won't be deducting any points here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom of the phone we find the microUSB port, which is flanked by the loudspeaker and the primary microphone. The setup looks like a pair of speakers but one of the identical grilles is actually a mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is where the 8MP Carl Zeiss-certified camera lens and dual LED flash can be found. The lens is set within a chrome plate that's a tasteful accent on our black test unit and it's the only fingerprint-attracting element on an otherwise smudge-resistant smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. The 2000 mAh unit inside is said to last for up to 10 hours of talk time or 400h of stand-by on 3G networks, but if its endurance is not enough for you, you'll have to carry either an external juice pack or a battery case - both of which are pretty awkward and uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that the Lumia 920 did pretty well in our dedicated battery test and achieved an endurance rating of 44h, which means it will last for nearly two full days if you do an hour of calls, an hour of video watching and an hour of web browsing per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The complete test is to be found here. You can find more about what we test and how over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another sacrifice mandated by the unibody design is the lack of expandable storage. While the more modest Lumia 820 offered you the option to cheaply increase its storage capacity via the microSD card slot, the Lumia 920 flagship is stuck with what it has built-in. Luckily, 32GB should be enough for most users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 has superb in-hand feel and is built to last. Weighing the substantial 185g, single-handed operation isn't as comfortable as that of a Lumia 820, but most tasks can still be carried out at with reasonable ease. The smartphone's curved sides and display benefit the handling quite a bit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is meant to look the same across all devices but makers still have a way to customize the experience and stand out against the competition. Nokia has more leeway than other makers thanks to its deal with Microsoft, but it also has the most riding on the platform - Nokia doesn't have Android to fall back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, WP8 on a Nokia Lumia is noticeably different from what you get from competing makers thanks to a number of exclusive features. You can see a lot of those plus a general scoop of the UI in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the look and feel of Windows Phone OS is mostly unchanged, there are a number of improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device just as before. You can also press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has added a lot of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to add notifications and images on the lockscreen. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps get to show more limited info ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - one of the installed apps can be set to choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account) or you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI (previously known as Metro) is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles - when you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger or smaller. Or they could have even implemented drag-to-resize like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at a glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's oversimplifying it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking - well, not true multitasking, but an iOS-like approach instead. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (navigation clients, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kinds of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you start frantically hitting the back key it will start closing all of the opened apps, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the opened apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: much like on the Start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the well... system settings you can think of, like the sounds, the color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application pane let you configure app-specific settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has expressed that it's working on such a feature and we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out loud, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice Actions, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, no matter how well you protect your phone software-wise, no manufacturer is offering protection against kids dropping or throwing the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - any company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info to help them with their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book up to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many friends and too many notifications waiting for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc.), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, but the ringer is quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 offered loud and clear in-call sound and we had no issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 920 scored an average. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem. You can read more about how we do tests here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (only the whole message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, mark them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up with the available actions and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing its own music service called Mix Radio ahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2012, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the Lumia 920 now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality should have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the Nokia Lumia 920 audio output wasn't particularly great or worthy of the flagship status of the device. The smartphone has good volume levels, but its output is by far not the cleanest around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 920 mostly managed good scores with the higher than average intermodulation distortion the only exception. However, most of its direct rivals are bordering on perfection in this scenario, so the Lumia 920 output is slightly disappointing. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones isn't too bad but the intermodulation distortion increases even further. The stereo crosstalk increases very slightly and remains good for the case, but the overall output probably won't be enough to please the more demanding audiophiles out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera with optical stabilization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 920 has a 26mm wide-angle lens by Carl Zeiss and a dual-LED flash, but it's unique in the mobile phone world - it's the first one to feature true Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) instead of digital tricks that try (and fail most often than not) to achieve the same result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is a gyroscope detects the motion of the phone and the whole optical assembly moves in the opposite direction to cancel out the movement (e.g. camera shake). That happens 500 times a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This has obvious advantages during video recording, but it also allows the Lumia 920 to use slower shutter speed in low-light conditions without fearing that camera shake will ruin the photos. That, combined with the f/2.0 aperture, leads to class-leading low-light performance. Keep in mind though that while the OIS works great for static scenes, moving objects in low-light scenes might still turn out blurry due to the slow shutter speed (motion blur).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The technological achievements behind the stabilization system gave Nokia enough grounds to market the smartphone as PureView even though it doesn't have the huge 41MP sensor of the Nokia 808. Instead, the Lumia 920 has that clever multi-aspect 8.7MP imager (1/3", µ 1.4 pixel size) that we know from the Nokia N9. It snaps photos at 3264 x 2448 resolution in 4:3 mode and 3552 x 2000 in 16:9 mode (only 11% drop in resolution). Most other cameras simply discard info from the 4:3 sensor to make it produce a 16:9 photo and lose 25% of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Lumia 920 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes a couple of seconds before a photo is taken and the camera is ready for the next shot. This is a bigger delay than we're used to see from modern phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses is an interesting feature, allowing third-party camera apps to enhance the core camera functionality without the need to access them separately and get use to their different UIs. The so-called Lenses are like plugins for your camera and they are available directly in the native camera app. They show up in the list of installed apps too in case you'd like to pin a Lens to the start screen, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens on the Lumia 920, which is by far the most powerful, but you can also download the Panorama and Cinemagraph lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Shoot uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode). You can also pick the best face and cycle through each facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama does what it says - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying. Shooting in portrait orientation is impossible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated, it really brings them to life. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting - a tripod works best. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern. This was great since you can get back to the image after the fact and correct it if you didn't get it right the first time around (we did that to reduce camera shake visible in the background).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a Cinemagraph and a panorama we shot with the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll split the Lumia 920 camera quality analysis into two parts - daylight and lowlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with looking at photos shot during the day. We'll go right ahead and rip the band aid off for you - the photos are average. We took a Samsung Galaxy S III, a Nokia 808 PureView and an iPhone 5 with us while shooting samples with the 920, so we have grounds for comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of fine detail that the Lumia 920 resolves is good in places but is very inconsistent - some areas look okay, while others are smudged beyond recognition. We suspect the noise reduction and the sharpening afterwards is responsible to some degree. Straight edges have artifacts and there are halos in areas of higher contrast. Fine detail like foliage or small letters gets smudged heavily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>White balance tends towards yellow and colors are way oversaturated and unrealistic. The dynamic range is okay, but the image processing leaves shadowy areas dark and you'll need to put the photos through an image editing program if you want to bring their detail out (that would increase the noise though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are 100% crops from photos taken with the four phones of the same scene. You can find the full resolution shots below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We waited for the sun to set and shot our ISO chart on the available natural light though the big north window. We used the Nokia Lumia 920, along with the 808 PureView, Samsung Galaxy S III and Apple iPhone 5. The photos were taken at automatic settings (with the flash off) and we also took photos with Night mode enabled on the Lumia 920 and Galaxy S III (the 808 also has a night mode, but it drops the resolution to 5MP so we're excluding it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also important to note that we held the phones in the hand rather than put them on a tripod. The best and worst photos for each phone were selected and we made a collage of 100% crops (best photos are on the left, worst on the right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With or without Night mode enabled, the Nokia Lumia 920 has a clear advantage. It produced bright, crisp (-ish) photos with relatively little noise. Enabling Night mode lowers the shutter speed, which results in more motion blur in the worst case scenario. This makes Night mode better suited for static scenes with little or no movement, while automatic mode will do better in more dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView put up a good fight (hooray for supersampling), but still there was more noise than in the 920 photos (which will become even more apparent if you try to brighten the photo in an image editor). Once again, best results are achieved with a steady hand. The 808 has an ace up its sleeve though - if your subject is within range of its xenon flash, it will easily blow the competition out of the water come night time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Night mode on the Samsung Galaxy S III made a huge difference, but it's quite sensitive to shaky hands due to the lower shutter speed and lack of stabilization. Still, considering it has neither OIS nor super sampling to rely on, it does well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5 doesn't have a dedicated Night mode. Its photos came out generally quite dark (it shows reluctance to lower the shutter speed below reasonable levels). Quite often however we saw quite noisy or quite blurry results too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>By the way, you can use the tool's scaling option to scale the 38MP photo from the 808 PureView to 8MP, which will make comparing it to the 920's photo easier.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera is better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 shoots 1080p and 720p videos (720p is the default mode). The OIS comes into play here if you're holding the phone in your hand (we doubt many people carry tripods around).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have the same oversaturated colors and smudgy details that troubled the still camera. The dynamic range is okay, but the camera sacrifices darker areas again. The Lumia 920 would often change the exposure, which caused "pulsing" from brighter to darker and back. On the up side, the continuous autofocus behaved well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bitrate of the 1080p video was a steady 21 Mbps while the framerate hovered around the 30 fps mark. The Lumia 920 has three high-dynamic range microphones (meaning it can capture loud sounds without distortion) but even so audio is recorded in mono only (99Kbps, 44.1kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 720p videos the bitrate fell to around 16 Mbps with the same 30 fps framerate. Audio is mono again too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a 1080p sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video stabilization is such a major feature of the Lumia 920 (it earned the camera the 'PureView' tag), so we decided to test it. We started with some casual panning, followed by walking in place and jumping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance the difference isn't really major - each of the two contenders has its moments of superiority in the video. If we hadn't named the two halves, you'd probably have a hard time telling which one uses optical stabilization and which one is simply employing a cleverly designed software algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, for its stabilization to work so well, the iPhone 5 is forced to use only the central part of its sensor, while the Lumia 920 can use the whole thing, which gives it both a wider viewing angle and the option to do pixel binning, which helps fight digital noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 video was slightly more stable here, particularly when the more rapid action was happening. In the various other scenarios we tried the results were more or less the same - a slight advantage for the Lumia 920 in terms of smoothness and that notably wider viewing angle.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA and 4G LTE connectivity (there are two versions of the phone with a different set of LTE bands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in range of an LTE network, the 920 will do up to 100Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 3.1. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 920 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 920 on top of it and will charge it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 got a major upgrade, but kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent. The Lumia 920 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing and the 332ppi pixel density keeps text sharp even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the Nokia Lumia 920 to match the other WP8 phones we've tested in terms of performance in the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmark tests and it delivered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is working on the Xpress Browser for Windows Phone, which does the web page compression trick independently of carriers, but that isn't available for the Lumia 920 yet. We're slightly disappointed that Microsoft and Nokia promised stuff that we wanted to try out, only to find out it's not yet available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 920 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing offers more than just web results though - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is Local Scout, which lets you search for various points of interest around you. There's the camera scanner too, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The third one is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store (formerly Phone Marketplace) is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is higher than 100,000 and, while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 won't work on the older versions but all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table and they are more powerful than the default Bing Maps that other Windows Phones come with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drive is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offers quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers and even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout app will locate nearby points of interest and it will even show you indoor maps of malls. The app has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone perpendicular to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now. There, that's one base covered. The Ativ S with its larger screen and more reasonable weight might have a thing or two to say about it, but the Lumia 920 is definitely the most complete package the Microsoft platform offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia flagship has a great screen, excellent design and impressive build quality. It's also a smooth performer and, thanks to the updated WP8, looks fresh and distinct. And while Microsoft doesn't allow much room for UI customizations, the Nokia exclusive apps make a huge difference and keep the Lumia 920 on top of the WP food chain.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The great free voice-guided navigation with offline maps, the cool Nokia Music service, and the exclusive camera apps are actually good for more. They put the Lumia 920 in a great position to target the iPhone 5 and steal a few customers away from iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year ago, comparing those two would be considered outrageous, but the truth is Microsoft is catching up pretty fast. It lifted some of the self-imposed limitations such as the mass storage support to buy some time until it catches up in other areas (we need a proper notification center, for one). There are also some exclusive features like the Kid's corner, while the lenses app is a great new approach to photography on smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the iOS 6 Maps fiasco, Nokia grabbed the chance to bring its HERE service to the platform. So now that iPhone users have had a taste, they may be more likely to try and give its better version a try on the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 also provides a nice alternative to those, who were disappointed by the modest increase of screen size on the iPhone 5. At 4.5" and with an appropriately higher resolution, the Lumia 920 screen is far better suited to video watching and gaming (the number of game titles in the stores is a different story altogether) than the 4" unit of the latest Apple smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there's no avoiding the elephant in the room, which in WP8's case is the choice of apps. Microsoft and its partners are doing all they can to catch up with Android and iOS, but they have a long way to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't really need 700,000 apps, as long as the important ones are covered, but there are still some gaps to be filled. As things stand now, there're are barely any areas which the Windows Store has blatantly ignored, but choice is limited in many and you might need to occasionally settle for a not-so-well-designed app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the matter of pricing and availability. Amazon is currently offering the 32GB smartphone for $20 with a two-year AT&amp;T contract, while the 16GB iPhone is going for $200 ($300 for the 32GB version) on contract, but is available at three of the major carriers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SIM-free the difference is even bigger: the Nokia flagship is $450 to the $650 for the base iPhone 5, which has half the storage. Things are closer in Europe, but the Lumia 920 remains the notably cheaper option and has support for a larger number of the upcoming LTE networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it seems Nokia has done a pretty good job this time around. The Sold Out signs are no accident and if the Lumia 920 keeps it up, the Finns will have something to celebrate. Its sales alone won?t instantly bring Nokia back in contention, but could really be the start of the fight back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, Android shouldn't assume it's absolutely safe. Sure, it has a pretty big lead in terms of sheer specs and features, and the droids are generally cheaper than their WP8 alternatives. But the Lumia 920 comes at a time when the current Android flagships are probably starting to lose some momentum halfway through their ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft and Windows Phone are Nokia's only shot at getting back into the race. This is a situation that no company would like to be in and a huge responsibility for the Lumia 920. It must be wondering which one weighs more on its shoulders, the company's past glory or hopes of the future. It doesn?t crumble under all that weight though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things maybe even start to look at least a little bit brighter for Nokia. And even if the light at the end of the tunnel is, you know, an oncoming train, we can bet you'll hear the Nokia Lumia 920 say, "Good. Finally a match for size".</paragraph>
