		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 is Huawei's bid to bring an extra touch of class to the upper midrange. Some serious hardware in a highly attractive shell may as well help the Chinese pull it off. Whether it is meant to co-exist with the P8 flagship or be its alternative in select markets, the Honor 7 manages more than a few nice surprises in multiple departments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the one before it, the Honor 7 omits the Huawei logo - perhaps an attempt to raise the profile of the midrange lineup as a stand-alone brand. Anyway, elegantly engraved across the alloy back, the Honor logo couldn't have hoped for a better-looking background. Still, Huawei's touch is easily recognizable, from the stylish alloy chassis and EMUI 3.1 on top of Android Lollipop, to the solid fingerprint scanner implementation and the impressive 20MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei didn't make the Honor 7 as thin as the P8 for a reason - there's just more, and better, hardware to accommodate. The extra 2mm of depth allowed room for a higher-res main camera, a superior selfie cam with its own LED flash, a fingerprint scanner, a bigger battery and an extra configurable hardware key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saved the best news for last - the Honor 7 comes cheaper than the Huawei P8, which puts the latter in a rather awkward position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's latest Kirin 935 chipset is surely capable enough but it may have an inherent flaw, its GPU. Having seen and experienced the same quad-core Mali-T628 graphics chip in previous Huawei handsets, we've been less than impressed. Huawei opted for the same old GPU yet again, so we have our doubts about its gaming capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal unibody comes at the expense of a non-removable battery, which we are OK with. But it's still beyond us why Huawei doesn't want to enable 1080p at 60fps or 4K capturing. Is it because of the underpowered GPU? Could be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we're done guessing. Let's get busy and see what the Honor 7 is really capable of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Honor 7 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 measures 143.2 x 71.9 x 8.5mm and weighs in at 157g. This is just 2mm thicker than the recently released P8 and 13g heavier. The Honor 7 is by no means inferior in terms of build and finish - the only thing that suggests a lower spot in the pecking order is the screen bezel - there's more of it here but by no means a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Honor 7, Huawei opted for a new take on the Honor series, ditching the dual-glass package in favor of an alloy unibody. This surely has put some extra weight on the new Honor, but it has provided for great grip and quite possibly, durability. And that's a fair deal we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the Huawei Honor 7's front is occupied by the 5.2" 1080p IPS display. Upon a closer look though, the front LED flash is sure to get your attention. The Honor 7 is a selfie-centric device and both its camera hardware and software mean business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtle but noticeable strips at the very top and bottom of the Honor 7's back mark the device's antennae and are therefore not made of metal. They are made of textured plastic instead, but are by no means an eyesore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7's back looks a lot like the Mate7's - the familiar fingerprint sensor just below a prominent camera lens. Huawei found a way to use the sensor in a much better way than Apple and Samsung. It works even when the screen is off - a gentle touch is enough to instantly unlock it. The sensor is also used for various system-wide gestures, which don't involve fingerprint recognition. You can pull the notification center up an down, take pictures, answer calls, among other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is notable for its great build and grip, which is a huge improvement over the Honor 6. While it maybe a little thicker and heavier, it is by no means bulky and the look and feel of steel is worth it. The phone can be easily controlled single-handedly, especially if you enable the one-hand operation gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, smudges are a non-issue on a brushed metal smartphone like the Honor 7.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.2" screen we find a couple of sensors, the 8MP selfie cam, the earpiece and an LED flash. The opposite panel has the 20MP main camera lens under a piece of sapphire glass, a dual-LED dual-tone flash and the fingerprint scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Honor 7 has the 3.5mm audio jack, the noise-cancelling mic and the IR blaster. The microUSB port is at the bottom, flanked by the loudspeaker and primary mic grilles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and the power/lock key are on the right of the Honor 7. The left side of the device hosts the ejectable tray for a dual nanoSIM or a nanoSIM/microSD card setup. The hardware Smart Key is also on the left - you can configure its functionality in the phone's Settings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 is equipped with a pretty standard IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. With a diagonal of 5.2-inches, it is slightly bigger than the 5.0-inch Honor 6. The pixel density is pretty good as well at 424ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has improved the blacks since the Honor 6 and while they are not as deep as on the P8's IPS-NEO display, they are a touch above average. The display is quite bright at 100% and manages a great contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the brightness scrubber is a total mess. When positioned at the middle, the display is barely legible, while the actual 50% brightness is achieved at about 3/4 of the slider. It's very tough to nail the proper setting and we suggest you rely on the auto-brightness mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewed outdoors in direct sunlight, the Honor 7 remains visible with low reflectivity. Its performance is slightly above average in this department.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 is powered by a 3,100mAh battery. The non-removable unit has the same capacity as what the Honor 6 got - a little extra juice than the P8. The smartphone did above average in our battery test scoring an endurance rating of 64 hours. This means you can rely on the Honor 7 for two and a half days on a single charge, if you are to use if for an hour each of calls, web browsing and video playback daily. Oddly, the single and dual SIM standby performances turned out identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you should have in mind that the smartphone's brightness at the typical 50% setting was way too low and even though we set the slider to a more usable level at about 60%, the screen was still rather dim. Boosting the brightness level even more will lower the battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for fast charging but the retail package may not include the right accessory. You should read the box's description as its contents may vary by market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 comes with quad-band GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz, multi-band 3G (model and market dependent). LTE Cat.6 is supported for downlink speeds of up to 300Mbps, and according to its specs it covers LTE bands 1 and 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is duly covered with dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and hotspot support. Bluetooth v4.0 is on board as well, and so is GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS. NFC is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an infrared blaster available, but with no relevant software preinstalled. You'll need to pick a third-party solution, of which there are plenty in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm headphone jack will accept your choice of headphones, as none are provided. The microUSB port supports USB OTG for connecting peripherals and external storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is an FM radio which has no RDS support.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 boots the company's latest EMUI 3.1, which skins an Android 5.0 Lollipop edition. Huawei adopted Android Lollipop, without Google's new material design though. The user interface has remained flat with almost no traces of Google's latest aesthetics. EMUI 3.1 remains true to its style and has preserved the user experience mostly intact. Fans will also be happy to know that the OS is still packed full of various extras and additional functions, baked right in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen looks simple, but hides lots of useful tricks. You can easily start the camera, you can also pop up an iOS-like control center from the bottom with various. The latter also holds a few options for controlling the covers and cycling through them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics on the lockscreen are referred to as Covers and the phone comes with quite a collection of them and a means to discover and instantly download more. They are really being treated like first class citizen with a dedicated download center, complete with channels, subscriptions and auto-updates. You can actually go in, set a few of your preferences and let the covers cycle between every screen wake, so you always have something fresh to look at. That's definitely the most eye-catching feature of EMUI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with five customizable shortcuts, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens. There are nine homescreen panes at most - and at least a couple of them will be populated by the preinstalled apps. Widgets are available, you can also opt for different transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is customary for Chinese Android UIs, there is no app drawer like there would be on vanilla Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone or a Xiaomi. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style and animation. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at random or specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two pages - one that hold all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles. You can swap around the ones you want visible on the first three rows. The shade has undergone some degree of modification. It is now transparent and creates a blur effect underneath, quite reminiscent of iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted apps, and there's a "Clear all" button that also informs you how much memory you've freed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a system-wide Search, which was borrowed from iOS - you swipe down anywhere on the homescreen and you can search throughout all content on your phone. Just like Spotlight on iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has invested quite a lot of effort in various usability and accessibility features and most things that are not customizable through theming can still be rearranged and moved around. The phone comes with features, such as customizable navigation bar, simple homescreen, Do not disturb mode, and even one-hand optimizations for system apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various display options are also accessible on a system-wide level. The UI can be tailored to your needs and the lockscreen can be as secure as you would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>EMUI 3.1 offers granular control over various system functionality via the Phone Manager app, including protecting apps with a password or a fingerprint. Those can be different from the PIN/fingerprint for unlocking your device. You can also block calls and messages from here (Harassment filter), regulate battery usage with different power optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has given battery management an equally thorough treatment. The Phone Manager has a dedicated interface within the Power Saving options for managing what it refers to as protected apps. The notion is that only applications that are deemed necessary by the user can be left to run in the background and consume battery and possibly network data, when the screen is off. Any app not on the list has no such privileges. This level of control is astounding ad we really wish that other manufacturers would adopt similar mechanisms to give back users granular control of their software and hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone Manager also features a notification center, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion control is also big on the Huawei Honor 7. There are flip gestures, as well as picking up, tilting and more. All of those are extensively customizable to your liking as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can configure three different functionalities for the so-called Smart key, the one on the left side of the Honor 7. You can set actions (apps or shortcuts) for single press, double press and long press. For example we set Take a Screenshot option at a single-press and it made this review way easier to complete. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Suspend button - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your P8 with just one hand, but if that's not enough for you, there is always the one-hand mode - it uses the accelerometer to move the keyboard, the dialer and the navigation bar to the left or right side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knuckle sensing technology is also available. More of a gimmick than anything else, you can use your finger's knuckle to double tap on the screen and that would create a screenshot. You can also capture only a certain area of the screen by circling it, again with your knuckle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we've saved the best for the end. There are a couple of super useful gestures you can perform on the fingerprint sensor below the rear camera. Note that you can do those with any finger, there is no need of print recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you can answer a call with touch and hold. Alarms can't be turned off the same way. Snap a photo or capture a video with tap&amp;hold too. Then you can swipe down and up for showing/hiding the notification panel. We found all of those really cool and useful, so we recommend opting for these gestures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 is powered by the home-brewed HiSilicon Kirin 935 chipset, identical to the one ticking inside the Huawei P8. It is equipped with a total of eight Cortex-A53 processors, four clocked at 2.2 GHz and another four at 1.5 GHz. On paper, this looks like quite an adequate setup by current standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, the real problem with the custom Kirin 935 is that it features a far-less powerful GPU than those by the competitors. The Mali-T628 MP4 is hardly a powerhouse and can potentially hurt the graphics performance of the phone significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason AnTuTu, GeekBench 3 and BaseMark OSII 2.0 were incompatible with the Honor 7, but we'll update the scores as soon as the compatibility is fixed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick things off with the all-round Basemark OS II test. Here, we get a first glimpse of the Honor 7 falling short in overall scores. The result is most-likely due to the already mentioned poor GPU, which drags down the otherwise excellent number-crunching power of the eight core processor setup. The last-year Snapdragon 801 does noticeably better than the newest Kirin 935 chip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's check the CPU scores breakdown. While the single-core performance turned out uninspiring, all eight cores combined are a real threat to the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same, however, definitely can't be said about graphics performance. The chipset's performance is really modest in this department. But we already knew this from the Honor 6 predecessor, which employs the same GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p offscreen scores are quite poor compared to the latest Adreno units and on par with the Huawei's recent phones. The onscreen scores are steady and look a tad better, very close to Adreno 330 GPU inside the Snapdragon 801 lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X GPU benchmark also puts the Huawei Honor 7 a hair better than its Kirin siblings, but it's still at the bottom of the chart with those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throughout those previous tests we though some of the lower scores might be due to poor OS optimization. Huawei has cut off a lot of the original Android Lollipop and has replaced it with proprietary apps and services. The stock browser performance confirms our suspicions, so you might want to use Chrome or other alternative.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the P8, the Honor 7 benchmark performance is a mixed bag, probably suffering from the choice of custom hardware. This, however, is only part of the story. Kirin chipsets have historically been bundled with rather meager GPU's and this one makes no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can expect stellar octa-core processor performance, and the 3GB RAM will surely make multi-tasking look like a hassle-free job. But the disappointing graphic performance will reflect on high-quality video playback and a lot of graphics-intensive 3D games. If you are a gamer, the Honor 7 should not be among your top considerations for sure.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 phonebook is laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes. It actually resides in a single application along with the dialer and messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function. Tapping on a contact brings up a popup with access to a contact's scrollable info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can input a variety of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook supports blacklist option for blocking contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 held on to signal excellently and in-call sound was just fine. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its face while it's ringing would mute the call ringing. Alternatively, picking the phone to your ear while it's ringing, automatically answers the call. A sea of other customizable gestures is also available, as already mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. It offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers. It can also be docked to one side or the other for easy accessibility, or, span the entire lengths of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Honor 7 through our traditional loudspeaker test and it got a Good score, just a hair below the Very Good mark. It was indeed loud across all of our tests and the speaker quality was close to perfect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 keyboard features some additional settings thanks to its Swype integration, including themes, split keyboard modes, and keyboard height, but sadly many of them are hidden within the input settings menu rather than as shortcuts from the keyboard like on most interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is support for gestures as well as integration of Google's voice typing with their downloadable language voice recognition packs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 may run on an entirely new Android version, but, as already stated, MIUI 3.1 has borrowed a lot of its styling and features from its predecessor. The image gallery is one of them. It still offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. It defaults to the Timeline view, but you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements (which detects faces automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very intuitive and packed with options, including things like filters, effects, levels and even special watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood. Every teenager would be pleased with the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it came to playing videos, the Huawei Honor 7 default player does a good job supporting every common video codec, but unfortunately it lacks support for AC3 audio as is usually the case with most Android phones anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a way to load subtitles, but Dolby Mobile enhancement is supported. Not much else, however, is available in terms of options and the player seems kind of basic. It still works great though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your own playlists, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice little touch is the ability to filter the songs by length, so no pesky ringtones show up in your library.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed not to find RDS support - you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean, somewhat quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 did pretty well in our audio quality test. It's not the loudest handset around, but its output is among the cleanest around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When used with an active external amplifier, the Honor 7 delivered excellent scores top to bottom, but only had below average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively enough, plugging in a pair of headphones caused next to no degradation - just a barely detectable hike in stereo crosstalk. A feat like that is very hard to achieve and is even beyond the capabilities of many a flagship. The volume levels remained unimpressive though, preventing this one from getting a perfect mark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 20MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 brings a massive camera upgrade - it packs a 20MP Sony IMX230 sensor with F/2.0 aperture and sapphire glass protection. There is fast phase autofocusing system, as well as a dual-LED dual-tone flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera relies on an 8MP fixed-focus sensor with F/2.4 aperture and wide-angle lens. It is also coupled with a single-LED flash, a rarity among the smartphones today but it is gaining momentum lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is clean and simple, though quite ripped off from the Apple's iOS. You can switch between the main shooting modes with swipes - light painting, beauty, photo, video and good food. Those wouldn't be our first choice if we were to arrange them, but sadly the order is not user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters are available, as well as panorama, HDR, all focus, burst, night scene, time-lapse and slow-mo. You can find these advanced modes via the settings shortcut. If you opt for the all-focus, your Honor 7 takes a few pictures, while you are holding your phone steady and you can choose the focus later, including all in focus. It works nice and hiccup-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The light painting mode offers four different settings - tail light trails, light graffiti, silky water, star track. Whatever the scene, your Honor 7 will first take a picture with the proper exposure settings and then it will capture the light trails of either cars, stars, water or other moving objects. After you finish capturing those, the light trails will be automatically added to your picture. This process actually ends with stunning results! More on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 20MP samples came out with plenty of detail across the frame, mostly accurate colors and good dynamic range. The photos are sharp and what's better - there are no over-sharpened details. The high-res images are not without flaws, though, and they're readily visible when the images are viewed at 100% on a big screen. The immature noise suppression results into an unnatural grainy look, especially in areas of uniform color such as the sky. Luckily those are easily fixable once you downscale the samples to say, 10 MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color saturation is right, but the camera has a slight tendency to underexpose in bright daylight. If anything, it's beneficial to your images as it preserves data in the highlights. Just like with the previous Honor 6 model, at times we witnessed pronounced differences in exposure of the same scene over a period of a few seconds. It's nowhere near the worse we've seen, and your mileage may vary depending on your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 camera has a built-in HDR mode and it works well. Processing is conservative and images came out balanced and natural-looking. But the above average dynamic range of the standard samples already does pretty neat job of bringing detail in the shadows, so we found ourselves rarely using the HDR switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 performed well in panorama mode. When held in portrait it produced images about 4,000 pixels high, and a 180-degree rotation produced a 12MB image. Exposure was even across the shot and stitching was accurate with no visible artifacts. Opting for shooting in landscape mode halves the vertical resolution at 2,000 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, as promised, we are bringing to you few Light Painting samples. We tried the tail light mode and Light Graffiti. Because the Honor 7 takes the actual picture at the beginning, no matter how long you take to complete your creation, the rest of the scene seems to stay clear and sharp and doesn't change exposure. Note the final picture is always mirrored and comes in 8MP resolution. Still, the results are pretty awesome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we snapped a sample with the front 8MP camera. It has a fixed focus and there is a LED flash to help you take beautiful selfies in the dark. The selfie interface supports lots of beautifying effects, plus owner specific recognition so the phone will make sure the phone's owner always looks their best on group selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 has plenty of smartphones to contend with in our Photo compare tool, which lets you see just how it fares against other 20MP shooters. You can placed it up against its predecessor, the Honor 6, to see if there is any noticeable improvement.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 offers 1080p videos at 30fps. Sadly, there's no 60fps or 4K recording, although the hardware seems more than capable to handle it. Videos are stored as MP4 files and have a bitrate of around 19Mbps for 1080p resolution. There's stereo sound at 96Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with the Honor 7 are rather unimpressive - the resolved detail is just average, and while the colors are accurate and the dynamic range is good, the overall video softness is rather disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here a sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a 1080p@30fps untouched video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR videos are supported, but those look really unnatural. You can download a small 1080p HDR sample and check it out for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to know how exactly the Honor 7 stacks against the competition, you should visit our video comparison tool below. We noticed it does way better at close distances rather than in usual scenes, such as the streets outside. Notice the rich detail in the background in both normal and low light conditions. That's really odd.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droids nowadays, the Huawei Honor 7 comes with two browsers to handle your web surfing needs. The stock browser offers largely the same functionality as Google's bundled Chrome browser, but we found the latter to be a more capable performer. Chrome also lets you sign in with your Google account and access open tabs and history from other sessions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Huawei's homebrewed apps is the Phone Manager. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage. We've already talked about those in our first software chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's quite a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations. It comes with a very useful Safe folder, for protected storage. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has included some nifty camera features in the Huawei Honor 7, some of which are accessed as individual apps. The Magnifier is especially nifty for looking at stuff up close, while the markedly female-targeted Mirror apps lets you get a quick look at yourself, with included brightness adjustments and zoom options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard issue stuff such as notes, calendar, world clock with stopwatch and timer and a calculator. Nothing really special to point out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Huawei Honor 7 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Browsing Street view mode with the digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the end of our review, we can't help but feel a little confused. Was the Honor 7 the right thing to do? This isn't about the phone's pros and cons, mind you. It just feels odd that the Honor 7 is so similar to the Huawei P8 - and in some ways obviously better. Unless these two are exclusive to different markets, which is quite likely, there is no point getting the P8, is there? And that's as good a compliment as they get for the Honor 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first. The Huawei Honor 7 actually over-delivers as a successor of the popular Honor 6. It improves on the design, screen, camera, chipset and throws in a couple of hardware extras and the latest software. The selfie camera may not be that big of a deal but the fingerprint scanner that helps in navigation is a definite plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 did quite well in a number of tests and aced the CPU benchmarks. It offers dual-SIM telephony and the latest Android version with intuitive gestures. The phone does great at still photography and provides more than adequate battery backup, the display is quite nice and so is the general build quality. It did get some things wrong like the underperforming Mali T628 GPU and the rather poor video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently launched Huawei P8 is the first of many to get in the way of the Honor 7 - though it's more likely the other way around. The P8 is virtually the same device, in a slimmer body, which has no fingerprint scanner and front LED flash, and the main camera is of lower resolution. Yet, the P8 costs more than the Honor 7 in Europe. Hopefully, the Asian retailers will sort this out. The P8lite is a more affordable alternative from the company's latest lineup, which keeps the premium looks but halves almost all key specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei P8 ? Huawei P8lite</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many popular Snapdragon 801-powered flagships from 2014 cost around the ?400 mark and offer features you may consider important. The LG G3 has a Quad HD display and an OIS camera, the dust and water-proof Galaxy S5 offers an AMOLED screen, while the HTC One (M8) has the advantage of stereo BoomSound speakers, dual-camera setup and excellent finish. Sony's Xperia Z3 is quite popular because of its dual-glass design, water-protection and capable 20MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG G3 ? Samsung Galaxy S5 ? HTC One (M8) ? Sony Xperia Z3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex 2 is clearly superior - in terms of both looks and performance. Its signature features include a 5.5" curved P-OLED 1080p display, self-healing coating, powerful Snapdragon 810 chipset and very capable 13MP OIS camera. The G Flex 2's price plummeted and you can now get it for around ?340.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G Flex2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal Meizu MX5 is quite likely a rival to keep an eye on with a 5.5" 1080p AMOLED display and equally capable processor. It matches the main camera resolution, has 4K video recording but no memory expansion. However, the MX5 costs about ?100 less than the Honor 7, which is a very good deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Meizu MX5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the super slim and metal-clad Oppo R7. It impresses with build quality, a 1080p AMOLED display, a 13MP cam with Schneider-Kreuznach optics, and octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM. But the R7 suffers too from lack of GPU punch and has poor battery backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo R7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor 7 is good at its own game but not perfect. If power gaming and high-res videos are not top priorities, you won't be upset by the lack of GPU punch and the mediocre camcorder. The look and feel, the overall user experience and rich camera options are likely to pleasantly surprise you. The Honor 7 may well be the perfect introduction to the brand, while returning fans will find a lot to enjoy both on the inside and outside.</paragraph>
