			<paragraph>Nokia has created its new 6280 as a substitute for Nokia 6230i. Is this a successful move? Nokia 6280 is literally bulged with functions. On the other hand, it features quite an exotic slide-out construction, which provokes missunderstanding in the end user. Read this detailed mega review to find the answer to this question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case that you do not have the time or the patience to read the entire review you may want to have a look at the survey of all pros and cons of Nokia 6280 offered below. If you intend to read the whole review, however, simply skip the summarized pros and cons for you will find them all in the review chapters.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia has created the 6280 model as a substitute for the famous Nokia 6230 and Nokia 6230i. In terms of functional equipment it will probably be an easy task to complete. The question, however, is whether the end users will put up with Nokia 6280's sliding construction. Given the fact that a major part of the mobile users are still getting used to to clamshell phones, it seems s to be somewhat early for a mass success of the "sliders". This makes me think that a lot of customers will rather go for Nokia 6233, which is still in process of development and is expected to hit the market in August, 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> One of them will be knocked down</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the 6280 model Nokia has also launched the Nokia 6270 model, which is a little bit more simplified in terms of functions. The latter offers stereo speakers with 3D effects, but does not support WCDMA and therefore lacks video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6270</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: sprecise design ? display slides out silently</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: phone ? reasonable creak sounds ? sliding mechanism plays</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the phone is far from innovative. It is a bar decorated with rare silver strip or light gray lining. In result, Nokia 6280 neither bores, nor thrills. This is how all, so called mass phones look like. Just have a look at all successful Nokia models or the famous phones of other companies from the past - none of them have something to do with extravagancy and emphasized art decoration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6280 is a nice device of classic design </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single look into the mobiles' catalogue helps me classify Nokia 6280 as a small, but heavy device. It belongs to the category of averagely big phones due to its dimensions of 100 x 46 x 21 mm. However, its size of 115 g is just on the border between medium heavy and heavy phones. The proportions of Nokia 6230i, which Nokia 6280 is going to be frequently compared with, are as follows: 103 x 44 x 20 mm, 99&nbsp;g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's covers are made of plastics. They are not removable, which usually supposes a solid overall construction. The only removable part of the phone is its rear cover, which reveals the battery and the SIM card hidden beneath it. Nevertheless, Nokia has not avoided certain light creaks. According to our experience, they will most probably go worse with the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 has originally been introduced in a black color version. A light version has also been prepared though. I do appreciate the matt coat of the covers, which makes fingerprints invisible. The display, however, is a different story, reflecting every finger touch to the very last detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One more piece...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's portfolio contains very few slider phones. There have been only two classical "sliders" in Nokia's history, namely, the 7650 smartphone and the current stylish Nokia 6111. We could possibly consider the luxury models of the 8 line as part of Nokia's slider family too, but it would be a rather exaggerated decision as the only sliding part in all mobiles from the 8 line is their keypad cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is clear that anything that moves is a potential source of risk and problems. Rails will get worn out, the joint will start to play. Eventually, it is always the user that is off luck because damage caused from day-to-day use is not covered by any guarantee. Now let us take a closer look at the sliding mechanism of Nokia 6280 and make all relevant conclusions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Careful with whatever moves </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I need to say that my impression of Nokia 6280 was not as good as the one I had of Samsung D600 for example. Nevertheless, its sliding mechanism is fine and firm and works smoothly. I suppose that it has been designed in a way similar to Nokia N70, namely through the use of two opposing springs. After all, part of these springs is visible in the slot, once the handset is opened. They hold the phone in both dead points so that the display does not displace spontaneously. If you prefer to slide it out on your own, prop your thumb against the lug below the display and push. Tiny metal rails cover the guiding channel preventing it from early wear-out. Yet, I do not find this measure safe enough. The sliding cover seems rather "crank", which is a great disappointing indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Rails support the sliding mechanism</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: possible control in closed mode ? card hot swap ? landscape picture mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: extremely rigid switch-off button ? "Push to talk" key cannot be assigned any other function ? new type of memory card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sliding construction allows the display to occupy nearly the entire front cover of the device (for more information on the display, please see further on). Below the display you will see an assembly of functional keys, which is visible when the phone is closed. They are distributed in a standard way: two context keys are located right below the display, followed by the keys for call control. In the middle of the block, a four-way navigation button with a confirming middle part is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no need to open it</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the outer functional keys manage a significant number of tasks, any operation, which does not require inserting numbers or writing, can be provided with a closed phone. Yet, you will find the day-to-day use of Nokia 6280 much more comfortable if you open it, because you will not have to curve your thumb that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the receiver in the upper part of the front cover you will see a tiny camera lens, specially for video calls. The designers have even managed to insert a button on the top oval side, which merges into the front part of the phone. This button both switches off the device and helps the user select their preferred ringing profile. Unfortunately, it is quite embedded and thus somewhat difficult to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera located next to the receiver, main switch-off button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone there is a rectangle button, which activates and controls "Push to talk". The pity is that in no way its function can be modified. Below it, the infrared port and the loud speaker grid are located. If you jam it, the phone messes up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A new memory card, have you asked for it?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the left side of Nokia 6280 you will also find the tiny slot of the memory card held with a joint. Push the card until a click sound comes out - it is a sign that the card has settled in its right position. This is the first time that Nokia uses this type of memory card. The new miniSD format is not compatible with the RS-MMC format used in older models. I suppose that Nokia 6280 is going to be sold along with a 64 MB memory card, but we are not able to confirm to you this information, as we have not obtained the final package of this Nokia model yet. This is also why we cannot provide you with details about what will be possible to record in the memory of Nokia 6280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Memory card slot ? open slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I used a SanDisk card of 256 MB during the entire process of Nokia 6280 testing. Do not try to install it following the instructions given in the manual, because it is displayed upside down. You can exchange memory cards while the phone is running, so there is no need to switch off the device. It happened several times that the camera would not find the big capacity memory, so I would have to set up a place for saving my photos from the very beginning. Fortunately, this problem does not seem to be a constant obstacle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone is less sophisticated. Here you will find the Pop-Port connector and the slot for the new "narrow" charger, as well as a microphone and a strap eye-let. On the right side there is a volume control button and a key that serves as a camera release button. The latter is however rather rigid, so I ended up taking pictures by using the main control key. Anyway, the location of the release button makes it clear that picture should be taken with horizontal hand-hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Pop-port ? volume button ? camera release button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another sign in favor of the horizontal hand-hold is to be found on the rear side of the device: you need to turn the phone in order to be able to read the manufacturer's logo. Here you will also see the 2 megapixel camera lens mounted in the middle of a light-color field, a tiny mirror for making self-portraits and a flash LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera is located on the rear side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you remove the rare cover you will see a lithium-polymer battery of 970 mAh capacity. By the way, Nokia uses the very same type of battery in its communicators of the 9300(i) line. A battery of 1100 mAh is available too. Regarding the life of the battery, I am afraid I am not able to provide you with reliable estimation as during the testing process we tend to task the phone more than it is usual in day-to-day use. According to Nokia's official information, the 6280 model is supposed to guarantee 250 h of stand-by mode. The battery life in call mode depends on the net type: in GSM it is said to be 240 min, while in 3G - 180 min. The phone gets charged within a mere hour and a half. The SIM card is located under the battery and is tucked by a metal piece.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: extremely fine display ? good keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: no timing option for backlighting ? display is not protected ? display makes writing somewhat uncomfortable when slid out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, we have rarely had the chance to write about Nokia displays as of brilliant ones. It took a long time before Nokia discovered the TFT technology, while the era of the small displays with low resolution seemed never-ending. Let's hope that it won't be back anymore and that the QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution will be adopted as a standard one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To my opinion, any higher resolution in a common mobile phone is rather senseless as handset displays can hardly ever be bigger than 34 x 45 mm. In reality, any resolution higher than 5000 pixels on a cm2 is virtually imperceptible for the human eye anyway. Things look different in the case of smartphones and communicators where manufacturers could still consider implying VGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 features a TFT display with 262K colors. The latter is very bright and does not loose any of its image characteristics when looked under sharp angles. It is visible in daylight as long as you do not try to reflect the sun in it. In this sense, it is quite a pity that the display of Nokia 6280 is not protected at all. Let's hope that the lug mounted below it may help. Unfortunately, the phone does not allow for setting up the duration of the backlighting, which is very short - approximately 10 seconds. In practice, 10 seconds are not sufficient to even read a longer message and it is necessary to press a random key so that the display lights up again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Keypad is comfortable. The bottom edge of the slid display feels somewhat unhandy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keypad is good. Its keys are reasonably big and evenly distributed. You will also need to get used to working with the sliding display. I do not have any major remarks though. The keypad is back-lighted in white color, which goes weaker the more you move towards the bottom key line. It does not go out completely though...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad backlighting</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: 2 megapixel resolution ? landscape camera mode with a view finder across the entire screen ? high quality ? video resolution of 640 x 480 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: limited setup options ? lower quality pictures in comparison with other 2 megapixel camera phones ? extremely bad macro mode ? low video frame rate</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is a 2 megapixel photo mobile phone, working in a resolution of 1600 x 1200. You can also choose among other 4 lower resolution options. There are three quality options available. You may want to get an additional memory card as pictures taken in highest resolution may result to be bigger than 0.5 MB. The internal memory fills in just a few pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are taken while holding the phone horizontally. I myself would use the main button more frequently than the rigid release button located on one of the sides of the phone. The first picture is exposed within approximately 3.32 s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's camera features new interface. Images are displayed across the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All respective symbols and menu legends are visualized in the corners. If you decide to use zoom in your pictures, bear in mind that the digital zoom just makes crops from the full resolution. It is regrettable that Nokia 6180 does not offer user control for exposure compensation. For this function is extremely helpful every time a scene with proportion between lights and shades other than ideal is captured. Even though Nokia 6280 automatically adjusts pictures once they have been taken, this option cannot compensate manual exposure control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Landscape mode: camera interface ? settings (click on image to maximize)&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Btw, Nokia 6280's menu does not offer almost any setup options. The phone is equipped with a night mode, based on longer exposition, a LED flash to be activated in worse light conditions, a self-release button, and - newly - with a continuous shooting option. The rest of the options are not worth special attention. And that is all. Just consider - there is no option for user setup of the white balance, for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quality?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is one of the best camera phones on the current market (in competition with more than 80 other models). If we compare it with top-class phones equipped with 2 megapixel camera, however, it will not do so well. Nokia 6280 takes good, but much too sharp pictures. Besides, they get "crippled" by excessive compression, which deforms each edge and detail. And the macro mode is truly bad. Do not ever think of capturing text with Nokia 6280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video application is significantly better, mainly because of the excellent resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, which is an exclusive priority of Nokia 6280 and is not to be found in any other camera phone on the current market. Of course, one can always require more as far as image quality and frame frequency are concerned, but with Nokia 6180 it is finally possible to watch video with pleasure. The length of videos depends on free memory available at the moment of shooting, so the phone allows for truly long records. Each minute of video shot in highest quality mode eats about 15MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp; Pictures taken outside are good. Any worsening of the light conditions makes the quality worse</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Zoom: the big picture is reduced to a cut</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Bad macro mode&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Picture taking in night conditions: standard mode ? night mode ? standard mode with flash LED</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Night pictures: standard mode ? night mode ? standard mode once again (it is obvious that Nokia balances the white shade of the color spectrum in accordance with the corresponding plot, because in this particular case lighting in all three pictures was the same)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Saved pictures can be browsed in the gallery. If you hold the handset in a vertical position, pictures are displayed in a smaller size. However, you may want to see your pictures in full screen. If so, simply switch the display mode to landscape. The phone offers an automatic slide-show too. Pictures can be modified by a non-sophisticated editor and after that a print order can be given straight from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Pictures in the gallery ? full-screen view ? print option&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tip: Look at the picture comparison of three 2 megapixel camera phones</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pros: very fast performance ? Nokia 6280 gets started without SIM card as well ? new user interface ? great customization options ? active stand-by mode ? graphic themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: little internal memory ? poor graphic elaboration of the active stand-by mode ? settings buried deep down in the menu structure</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the disappointment of Nokia 6230i, which reacted slower than its forerunner, Nokia 6280 does please with its high speed. Main menu, phonebook, SMS editor, calendar? all applications get opened immediately, without any sign of delay. The same is still true for the work of the gallery with 2 megapixel pictures. The only moment when I experienced a certain slow down was when I inserted the memory card. Basically, Nokia 6280 is unusually fast and stable mobile. It didn't get jammed even once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that it is possible to start Nokia 6280 without using a SIM card is quite interesting. When you choose this option, the phone permits you access all functions, which work does not require the use of a mobile network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On its official website Nokia states that Nokia 6280 disposes of 10 MB of internal memory, but we have reckoned that in reality the end user obtains no more than 6.5 MB. More free memory can be gained through deleting certain pre-installed games and applications. In other words, there is too little memory. You won't make it without an additional memory card, that's for sure. The whole matter is a definite drawback for Nokia 6280, especially considering how slow the access to the memory card is. Internal memory is shared by gallery, messages, applications, and bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Memory info</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All objects not protected by copyright laws and the DRM (Digital Rights Management) system can be easily sent through Bluetooth or the infrared port. Of course, non-protected items can be received as well. If you have a USB cable, use the USB Mass Storage feature. Once you have plugged in the cable, you will be prompted, which mode you are interested in work with: a standard connection (for work with PC Suite, for example), data storage (Mass Storage), or print. The PC Suit program lets you get into the memory of the phone straight from a PC (by means of all three modes). As for mass download of pictures, use the "Save pictures" program.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New Series<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is based on the Series 40 platform of the last, third generation. It seems to be totally different form the first version as seen in the 7210 model, for example. The graphic design of Nokia 6280's user interface reflects this change pretty well too and can still be considered an innovation, no matter the fact that we have already seen it in the slider Nokia 6111.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At all events, the hottest innovation in Nokia 6280 is its active stand-by mode. It shows upcoming events and facilitates radio and MP3 player control. In the top part of the display you will see the icons of the quick-start applications, while in the very bottom part there is space for a text note. To change this type of functional and image distribution you will have to find the setup option for the active stand-by mode, which is successfully buried in the menu structure. Here is a range of items which can be used in the active stand-by mode: icon bar, indicators (info about network etc.), calendar (days can be switched straight on the main display), countdown timer, note, My presence, sound applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Active stand-by mode&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In my opinion, the active stand-by mode is a very useful application in any smartphone. However, in the case of Nokia 6280 I was forced to eventually deactivate it, because of its inappropriate graphic elaboration, i.e., too large font bordered with white line, unordered blocks...</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The cross of the functions that have been assigned to the main control button can also be viewed on the display ? or simple wallpaper if you prefer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I highly appreciate the fact that Nokia 6280 allows for a detailed setup of the font size. On the phonebook you can choose between two font sizes, while both in the messages and the internet browser you can pick up out of three different size options. The biggest font available is truly impressive. The smallest one, on the other hand, is so small that an entire message can fit on the display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be organized in four different ways: as a list, as a simple table, as table with legends, or with horizontally organized tabs. If you need to save as much space as possible, you may want to select the table-without-legends option, which allows for 12 icons to be viewed en block. Alike other image types icons can be additionally reorganized too. All icons in the menu are well depicted, but when animated, they partly lose their details and evenness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Four possible views of the main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 supports graphic themes, which change not only the wallpaper on the main display, but also the graphic image of the rest of the pages. The phone offers a font color change option, which helps make font visible on darker background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;     The simpler the graphic theme, the more practical it is</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each way of the main four-way button can be assigned a certain application. In Nokia 6280 you will find a "Go to" menu, in which you can place your preferred and most frequently used functions. More functions can be located in the icon bar of the active stand-by mode. If there is anything to complain about here, then this is the complicated location of certain settings, which seem inaccessible, unless you read carefully the corresponding manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User "Go to" Menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is quite interesting that Nokia 6280 - unlike smartphones of the S60 line- permits using the active stand-by mode simultaneously with key shortcuts. While in S60 the user is obliged to select one single option, here one of the four ways looses its function only to be able to consequently activate the active stand-by mode.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: top-quality sound ? video calls ? caller displayed in a big window ? standard ringtone option can be substituted by video ? big font size option in the phonebook ? once synchronized the phonebook can be ordered by last name ? intelligent voice dialing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: loud vibration ? phonebook fits in no more than 500 contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is a triband phone, so it works in the following three bands: 900, 1800 and 1 900 MHz. It also supports WCDMA 2100 and GPRS/EDGE. Incoming calls are accepted by pressing a corresponding button or by opening the device (the latter option can be deactivated, if necessary). Ringing is deactivated through a key press. I would like to commend Nokia for the brilliant sound of 6280. It is excellent, no matter whether it comes out of the earphones, or the loud speaker. It is pleasant and loud enough, with clear bass components. Certain slight distortion can only be noted when volume is set to maximum. Calls are terminated likewise - either by a key press, or by closing the device. Call records are limited to one hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Entering a phone number ? dialing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The presence of the 3G icon on the display is a signal that you can start a video call. Video calls are controlled in a standard way: your call partner appears in a large window, while you see yourself in a small one. You can select, whether sound should be played through the receiver or through the speaker. Picture transmission is a subject to cancellation. I did not manage to use the main camera located on the rear side of the device though. Nokia 6280's tiny camera transmits video of quite decent quality, better than the one demonstrated by Nokia N70, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video call</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you attach a picture to a certain contact, it remains on the display during the entire call. If it is you who initiates the call, the person on the other side appears in a tiny icon, which goes away afterwards. In case of an incoming call, caller's image appears across the entire screen, with the state bars and the name or the number of the caller being visible too. Incoming calls as well as contacts in general can also be indicated with a video. The latter is played in a full-screen mode, occupying approximately 2/3 of the display. Unfortunately, video sound is not possible to substitute with a standard ringing melody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 supports 64-voice polyphony. Yet, ringing in MP3, AAC or other "real" format is still more attractive. The sound is loud enough and has good quality. As expected, the phone offers vibrating alert. However, it is so strong that it makes movable parts of the handset shake so hard, that it almost outvoices classical ringing. In other words, vibration could in no case be considered a discrete alternative of standard ringing melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of missed calls appears in a window on the main display. Select it to get into the relevant menu. Here all calls made by one and the same caller are gathered under the cap of a single item, which is accompanied by the date and the time of the last made try. Saved dialed and received calls are organized in a similar way. Each viewed item stores the last 20 calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;View at calls menu items ? dialed numbers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia offers a comprehensive Call menu, in which all types of calls are chronologically ordered, including all multiple tries. What's more, in this phone you will find an item called "Message recipients", which stores names or numbers, to which messages have been recently sent. Nokia 6280 is also equipped with a "Message counter", which counts up sent and received SMS and MMS on four lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Whom did I send SMS ? how many of them did I send?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: ordered by last name<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the major disappointments in Nokia 6280 may turn to be its phonebook. It all depends on how many contacts you will need to store in it. If you keep no more than 500 names through the entire life of your phone, then you can be satisfied. But if you need more capacity, then you should forget about Nokia 6280 and start looking for another mobile phone. What I do not understand is why Nokia has decided to use such a limited capacity since it has already shown its skills in designing phonebooks with 1000 contacts (see Nokia 6230 and 6230i models).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The easiest access to the phonebook is by pressing the downward key, unless you have assigned a different function to this key. The contact list can be viewed in three possible forms: standard list, combination of a big-font name and a number, and combination of a name and a picture attached to it. The phonebook is searched by gradual writing of the initial name characters. It is praiseworthy that Nokia has finally corrected one of the drawbacks, which have dragged along with all its models (except for smartphones and communicators) since the moment of the first synchronization between mobiles and PC, which is phonebook organization by first name only. In Nokia 6280 first and last names are separated into two different items, so the user can choose, whether phonebook should be organized and searched by first name or by last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Middle font size in the phonebook ? big font size ? number assignment ? picture asignment</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact in the phonebook can be assigned as many as 16 fields, including five different numbers, various addresses and other text details. Each contact can be additionally accompanied by a picture, a video record, and a ringing melody of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If any of you feel uncomfortable with available contact customization, you may want to first locate the contact into a certain group and then assign a ringing melody and a picture to this group. However, in this case priority is given to individual setup of each contact. Groups can be set to work with ringing profiles as well. Here you can determine which group should be able to reach you and which one should remain silent. Inside the profiles application you will find setup options for various characteristics: type of ringing, melody (common calls and video calls are separated), loudness, vibration, sounds to be applied in Push to talk and in messages, as well as the type of sound response of the keypad. In addition, Nokia 6280 offers the so called timed profiles, which switch-back automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up ringing profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 offers voice dialing. To activate it press the corresponding key and pronounce the name of the person you are about to call. You do not need to teach the phone. The phone recognizes information that has been delivered to it, repeats it in a robot voice and starts dialing. Besides, Nokia 6280 goes further. Inside the language setup options you can even select your language in accordance with the accent, with which words should be pronounced by mobile's electronic voice. Furthermore, the phone accepts voice orders for activation of several additional functions, once again without any necessity to be taught in advance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numerical keys from 3 to 9 can be converted into shortcut ones. Key 1 is reserved for voice mailbox, while key 2 is prepared for a box that is meant to serve video calls. A press-hold on the zero key opens the internet browser.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: top-quality T9 dictionary ? no message shortening ? a list of the last several message recipients ? mass delete option of delivery notifications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: e-mail client in Java ? attachments of maximum 100 KB ? no automatic download of email messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 manages SMS, MMS, emails and "Push to talk". In the main menu you will also find two new special options: a sound MMS and an instant SMS, which immediately shows up on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages main menu ? new message creation options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's main menu contains a puzzling item called Postcard, which is not mentioned in the manual delivered with the handset. Considering the fact, that this item requires inserting a street address, I guess it is basically a media, through which pictures are sent to a certain company, which then prints them out and sends them. I did not manage to send a single message though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia deserves a complement for making a step back to its top-quality T9 dictionary. Not only was T9 in Nokia 6230i unsuccessful, but it was almost useless because of its poor dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS editor looks somewhat odd in the new graphic interface. It creates the impression that there is only one line available. There is no reason to worry though. The editor offers required space every time it is necessary. When you reach the moment when recipient should be entered, you can write their phone number straight away, select it from the phonebook, use a group, or check the list of people, whom you have recently sent SMS. Considering the fact that most users tend to send messages to a limited number of selected contacts, this last option is extremely useful as it permits direct access to frequent recipients. The editor counts down written characters and informs about the number of extensive parts a bigger message is divided into. Even tough Nokia states that short messages use shared memory, in reality it seems that the phone is able to fit in no more than 150 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   Three font size options in SMS writing ? two font size options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS delivery notifications can be activated either as a whole, or separately. Notifications blink several times on the display and then get saved. I appreciate the existence of a delete-all option in the list of delivered messages. You will find a separate folder called Delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Received messages ? notification list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike older Nokia models of Series 40, where it was necessary that a preview of prepared MMS was selected, the new MMS editor in Nokia 6280 shows MMS straight in the version, in which the recipient is going to obtain them. A broad range of fields can be attached to each MMS: text, picture, sound clip, video, visit card, and a note from the calendar. Multi-page MMS are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  MMS Editor ? attaching a picture ? sound messages are also MMS</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email: how to send a picture?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's email client is a Java application, which takes a longer time to start and works slowly in general. Besides, it is not communicating with the rest of the phone applications well enough. Nevertheless, it is able to pick up an email address form the phonebook and manages attachments in general. It is not possible to select emails addresses in the phonebook and use them for sending emails. This option is available for SMS and MMS only. Automatic message downloads cannot be set up, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Email client main menu ? received emails ? reading messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, the email client is not bad at all. It establishes a connection with POP3 or IMAP4 servers, downloads messages, and opens them. Attachments can be saved in the phone and also opened, provided only that Nokia 6280's software supports their format and that you have exited the email application. Sending process seems to be somewhat problematic. If you intend to send a simple text, you will not run into any difficulties and will definitely appreciate the perfect co-work between the java application and the phonebook, thanks to which manual inserting of email addresses is no more necessary. Problems may occur in attachments, with size larger than 100 KB. Considering the fact that a 2 megapixel picture can be as big as half MB, then it is clear that no picture in full resolution can be sent from Nokia 6280, unless you connect the device to a PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: very good alarm clock ? well-organized calendar ? modern calculator ? high-capacity voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: no text notes option in the calendar ? no wallet for saving confidential information ? no viewer for Office documents</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has improved the alarm clock in the Series 40 platform. It has repeat function. You can select its active days as well as the time between its repeated alarms. There are several alarm options: a standard peep sound, a sound from the phone memory, and radio (in this case the use of earphones is obligatory)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarm clock setup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits from both the bigger size of the display and its higher resolution. Once of a sudden it is possible to not only see its month view, but also displays an overview of all tasks for the respective date below it. Beside this, on the main display of the calendar you will also find the correspondent month, week, days of the week... Week views work in a similar way: bars with days and hours appear in the upper part of the display. The day overview is located below them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Month view at the calendar ? week view ? day view ? event detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers five types of tasks: meeting, call, birth date, note and reminder. The reminder is used for fast inserting of a certain detail, which you need to be reminded of. In other phones this particular need is answered in a complicated way by the "meeting" option. Each meeting task in Nokia 6280 can be accompanied by the following fields: subject, place, date and starting time, date and end time, date and alert time, alert type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, every second week, every month, every year). The calendar does not offer a note and thus does not synchronize it either. The lack of notes synchronization may be considered a drawback in the case of meetings scheduled in Outlook. At the same time, meeting place does get synchronized and transferred into the phone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The To-do list is pretty simple. It accepts only the following options: object, priority, alert time, and alert type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. Inside the list items can be organized in an alphabetic order or by the time of accomplishment. Tasks can be effortlessly copied into the calendar as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you may want to make use of text notes, mainly because they get synchronized with the computer and thus allow for longer texts to be transferred into the phone. Unfortunately, Nokia has not elaborated font size settings very well, because neither the text notes, nor the tasks can be viewed in three font sizes (like in the case of text messages, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Note preview ? note detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder uses the shared memory. You can choose, whether data should be saved into the internal memory of the phone, or on its memory card. Each record can be of maximum 60 minutes. A new record can be made anytime, as long as free memory is available. Nokia uses AMR format. A minute of voice record eats up approximately 100 KB of memory. What a pity that the button mounted on the left side of the device serves the "Push to talk" application only. It could have been ideal for the voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some other applications from the menu: countdown timer, stopwatch, and measure and rate converter located within the java applications; world time and calculator. The calculator features plenty of functions: along with common arithmetic operations it also works with powers, roots, reversed measures, goniometric functions, and the number pi. Besides, it features memory functions. However, it ignores the priority of the operators' actions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Measures converter ? world time ? clever and at the same time awkward calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pros: built-in radio and MP3 player ? application minimization option ? playlist manager in Nokia PC Suite</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: no RDS ? earphones with a standard jack can be plugged in through an adapter only</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we do not dispose of the complete package of Nokia 6280, we do not have the HS-23 earphones, which are going to be delivered with the phone, either. That is why I used a set of HS-3 earphones to test phone's sound capacity. The earphones serve as an antenna for the radio and are indispensable for its proper work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio features a function called Visual, which enables broadcasting with details about the correspondent interpreter, running competitions etc.. Nokia 6280 receives radio broadcast in FM band- from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Radio is tuned either automatically, or manually. Favorite frequencies can be selected too. What a pity that Nokia 6280 does not support RDS. The phone provides 20 positions to be occupied by your favorite radio stations. Switching between stations is easy - use arrows or mark numbers straight away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Radio is stereophonic. If broadcasting is low quality, the radio switches to monophony automatically. The monophonic mode can be activated from the menu too. What about the sound quality? It is not bad, having in mind the poor quality of the used earphones. The loud speaker is a substitute as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MP3 and video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player would run any file saved into phone's memory or on the memory card. If you need to transfer music files into the phone, however, you may want to use the Nokia Audio Manager program, which is a part of PC Suite. Nokia Audio Manager helps you create playlists and then transfer them into the phone through an USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is equipped with a very simple player for MP3 and AAC (+) files. It is controlled through the use of three keys: start/stop, forward within files and switching between files. The player can be minimized. Currently played file appears on the active stand-by display, if you have set it up so. From here you can switch to another file or even forward the file itself. Repeating and random play options are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP3 player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound provided by the earphones is poor. Nokia 6280 is equipped with an equalizer with several pre-installed modes and two user modes, but do not expect any miracles from it. Do not feel hopeless though for I remember what a difference in the sound quality it would make every time I plugged my Hi-Fi earphones in Nokia 6230i (using an adapter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer setup</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 plays video through an application called Media player. Along with video files it also supports streamed transmission. We have tried to convert a film into MPEG4.3GP format, which we then managed to play in a full-screen mode. Image was however disturbed by the Back and Pause legends, which were not possible to hide. Generally considered, watching clips on Nokia 6280 lacks any sense, even if the only reason against such a possibility is the lack of forward option.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pros: easy installing of Java applications ? good pre-installed games ? EDGE and 3G ? easy data connection setup ? free PC Suite</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cons: no minimizing option for Java applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 offers MIDP 2.0, which is fast enough. Here are the results of the JBenchmark test: 1831 (version 1), 253 (version 2). Right now I am not able to provide you with exact information on what programs Nokia is going to place on the memory card of the 6280 model. In the handset alone I found three games and three applications. As I already evaluated the applications in the chapter on time organizing, let me now write a few words about the games:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Application menu (including memory card icon) ? list with games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any additional games or applications can be saved into phone's internal memory or on its memory card. As for JAD and JAR files, they may simply be downloaded onto the memory card (by the use of a reader, for example) and then started straight from the phone. No installer is necessary. The maximum size of this application is 500 KB. Running midlets are not possible to minimize. They get closed instead, which is quite a pity.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Four by three<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are four different technologies for establishing internet connection in Nokia 6280: dialed data transfers, GPRS, EDGE, and the WCDMA third generation networks. All of them may come in handy in work with email client, MMS, Push to talk, or video streaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280's internet browser opens both WAP and internet pages, but as you may expect, their text versions are preferable. The browser is simple. Inside the view menu there is an option, which allows for switching to a full-screen mode. On all events, selecting the smallest possible font (out of three possible options) provides you with space that is more than enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All four technologies mentioned above can also be used for establishing internet connection from a PC. Nokia 6280 gets connected to a computer through an USB cable, through the infrared port, or via Bluetooth. The latter is available in its 2.0 version and thus supports the following profiles: DUN-GW, FT-Server, HandsFree-AG 1.0, Headset-AG, OPP-Client, OPP-Server, and SIM Access-Server. The infrared port can be deactivated manually, which is new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connection properties can be setup manually, but you may find it more comfortable and faster to use the Internet Connection program from the PC Suite. All you need to do here is select a modem (for example, Nokia 6280 USB, which gets created automatically), select an operator and press the corresponding button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have PC Suite installed on your computer, you don not need to install anything else, because Nokia uses the same program in all its current phones. There are no changes in PC Suit functional menu, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6280 is brilliant, no matter the fact that if it suffers certain crucial drawbacks, which would surely discard it if it entered a direct competition with top-class camera phones. Some of you may dislike the fact than Nokia 6280 is not a smartphone. Others will refuse to work with a phonebook of a limited capacity. Some may not like its sliding construction, others surely feel phobia to Nokia's logo. To me, the most important features of Nokia 6280 are its speed, its brilliant display, and its excellent user interface (except for the active stand-by display).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new user interface of third generation Series 40 is quite similar to the one used in smartphones, with icons being almost identical. It is evident that Nokia has made the first step towards unifying the control of its devices. The question therefore is: "Will there be a top-class mobile phone without an OS anymore?"</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not forget the competition. Inside Nokia's camp, there are Nokia 6230i (which is inferior) and smartphones (better than Nokia 6280). Sony Ericsson K750 as well as all models related to it may also be considered possible competitors. In terms of functionality, however, it is Sony Ericsson W900 that seems to be the main rival of Nokia 6280, for these two phones have been evaluated with precisely the same mark according to our mobiles catalogue. Samsung is able to compete with its D600 model. Siemens SXG75 is a potential competitor as well. Motorola does not have a device functionally comparable to Nokia 6280. The same holds true for the rest of the phone manufacturers. Smartphones play on completely different level. Their exceptionality is a matter of fact. In this sense, any smartphone (for example Qtek 8310) is a very strong competitor for any camera phone in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conclusion: Nokia 6280 is a brilliant mobile phone. It is perfectly equipped, fast, and attractive. And there is no doubt that the decrease of its price is only a matter of time.</paragraph>
