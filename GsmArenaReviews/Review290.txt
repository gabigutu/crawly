			<paragraph>If there's one thing the Samsung Armani phone has in abundance, it most definitely is style. Slim, compact and high-tech, the fully touch-operated Armani phone is not just the final touch to your look - it's the finish with a flourish. Anyway, with us the tech junky tends to get the upper hand over the fashion savvy, and we are eager to find out if there's more to it than what meets the eye. The really promising Samsung Armani phone seems the right mix between technology and looks, but we're more interested in how it fares as a gadget, not an accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The model designation that hides behind the Samsung Armani name is actually Samsung P520. That alone may be enough of a hint that the Armani phone is an offshoot of the Samsung P-series. The Samsung Armani has inherited the same form factor and has the same size and weight as the Samsung P310 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone comes in two retail packages - standard and extended . The difference between the two is the Bluetooth headset in the bigger one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard contents of the retail box are a hard leather case, charger, data cable, memory card, a wired stereo headset, soft pouch as an alternative to the leather case and, finally, a cleaning cloth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the contents of the box look really classy and are all Giorgio Armani branded. The user guide has the most exquisite covers we've seen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So after you've had a taste of what's coming, you are welcome to hop aboard and stay with our Samsung Armani phone review right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Armani 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone's body is made out of very nice polished metal with a brass color that certainly looks the part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large touchscreen display won't necessarily make it an "iPhone-killer", however it's certainly a hip high-end feature that everybody would appreciate if implemented properly. Almost everybody's first impression when they first laid eyes on the Samsung Armani phone was how small it was in reality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting rid of the "calculator" looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The predecessors of the Samsung Armani - the Samsung P300 and P310 were well-known for their "calculator"-style looks. The hard leather case, the landscape display plus the rectangular keys all contributed to the impression. The Samsung Armani phone however has parted with the hardware keypad for good, and it no longer is a calculator look-alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only hardware keys left on the front are the golden Send and End keys, which have a slight elevation. They look a lot like the touch sensitive keys Samsung have been putting in their sliders lately, however they are just normal buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the Samsung Armani phone hosts pretty much all the rest of the available hardware keys. The Hold key locks and unlocks the touchscreen display. The red key is in fact the On/Off key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the universal headset/charger/data port is right above them. The port is the new type we saw for the first time in Samsung G600 and Samsung G800 - it's not retroactively compatible with older accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Giorgio Armani phone by Samsung offers a volume rocker and the hot-swappable memory card slot. Some Armani mobiles will be shipped with up to 1GB memory cards, but that would be region specific.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Armani mobile phone is pretty bare except for the 3 megapixel camera lens and the accompanying LED flash. The camera is a 3 megapixel one without auto focus and is also capable of recording video in CIF resolution. The performance of the LED flash is pretty standard. More on the camera performance and image quality will follow later on in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panels of the device are made of metal and have a really nice feel. They don't get smudged with fingerprints easily plus the mobile has a hard leather case that protects it well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the place the Armani phone by Samsung feels best is in its hard leather flip case. As if by magic, the display of the Armani phone goes off once you close the flip. The case has all the necessary cutouts to allow hassle-free operation with the keys. Even the 3 megapixel camera on the back has its own aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover is an easy task. As the Samsung Armani is a really compact handset, you can probably imagine that the battery is really compact too. In fact it seems the same as the one of Samsung D900 - at least in size, that is. The 880 mAh Li-Ion Armani phone battery is rated at up 220 h of standby and up to 6 hours of talk time. That's one serious promise on the part of the South Korean manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn't test the battery life inside-out, but we guess that under moderate usage the handset should last about two or three days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being such a compact chap, the Armani phone is really comfortable to hold in hand. The wider-than-usual form factor provides for a confident handhold.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display is the keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Armani phone by Samsung is equipped with a 2.6" touchscreen 262K color TFT display. Besides looking great it also allows the user to punch their way around the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display offers nice colors, contrast, and saturation but doesn't fare that well under direct sunlight. The fingerprints all over the touchscreen display don't help much either. There is of course the Sunlight mode, which boosts brightness and contrast in order to ensure legibility but it's not our favorite option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you've probably already guessed it, the display serves as a keypad too. And it is a proper keypad, we may add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are delighted with its performance mostly due to the added haptic feedback. That simply means that almost every touch on the display produces a slight vibration that lets you know your command has been acknowledged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We say "almost every touch" since the Samsung haptics only take effect when an action is completed - for example upon confirming something. When you dial a number the virtual numeric keypad doesn't give off any vibrating response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bit of a tech newsflash here: the almighty Apple iPhone doesn't have haptic feedback, while the LG KU990 Viewty has it with a lot of user configurable options such as the vibration style and strength. The Samsung Armani only allows choosing between three levels of vibration intensity, which is not bad at all too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Judging by the sound of it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung Armani phone we had no problems during calls - sound is crystal clear and yet loud enough so that you won't have troubles communicating with whoever you are calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to dial a number, you need to use the fullscreen touchpad. Unlike some of the other Samsung handsets we've reviewed recently, the Armani phone doesn't suggest contacts, whose numbers contain the digits you have typed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When dialing, the contact's picture doesn't show up, however it's displayed fullscreen on an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to loudspeaker performance, the Samsung Armani phone was definitely not among the loudest ones we've heard. You can see how it ranks alongside some other devices we've tested. To find more info about the test itself and the other devices we have measured, check out the dedicated page here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The nice-to-look-at Croix interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The award-winning Samsung Armani touch interface called Croix (Cross) is based on the well-known menu style we've seen in previous (not so high-roller) Samsung handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the main standby screen there are three functional areas - a calendar bar at the bottom, a crosshairs in the center and a shortcut bar on the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A finger sweep on the Calendar bar at the bottom changes the view to the current time and date only. If you have setup the world clock, it will show more than one clock. When the music player is running, the currently playing track is shown on this bar, along with the album art if there is one. The whole bar can be turned off should you choose so. Unfortunately, this Calendar is not associated with the Organizer part of the interface and doesn't show up the pending events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crosshairs in the middle of the screen open a special cross-like shortcuts menu. From there you can open the music player, the phonebook, messaging and the calls log. Touching the center opens the main menu. Shortcuts to this special cross-like menu are available throughout the whole menu interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut bar on the top of the standby mode features three shortcuts. The first one activates the Silent mode after a touch and hold, the second one opens the main menu and finally, the third one toggles the dialing keypad. We've never seen the concept of "press-and-hold" translated to a touch-sensitive interface but it works well in preventing accidental key presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 4 x 3 grid of icons. There are no alternative color versions besides the black and brass combo. Sub-menus are visualized as lists. Funny enough, all sub-menus have a numerical shortcut, which of course cannot be used in the case of the Armani phone, and yet it's there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing around with the Samsung Armani Croix user interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For scrolling through those sub-menus you can use either vertical sweeps or you can press on the side scrollbar to activate it and scroll by slowly drawing your finger up and down along the scrollbar. We have to say that scrolling itself is far away from the almost physical interactivity of the iPhone interface. The Armani scrolling has its quirks and let's just say that we are not delighted by it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found a consistent flaw with the Samsung Armani user interface. All the icons on the standby screen and the ones in the main menu lack text labels. Their styling also makes it hard to guess their function. The main menu icons have text labels but they are only visible once you touch the individual icon - however touching those means starting their corresponding function. So essentially, you have to rely on some heavy Samsung experience to find your way around the Samsung Armani interface. However, we guess not all people have that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering data comes natural - a single tap on the field highlights it, then a second one invokes the on-screen keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is touch sensitive too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung Armani phone looks the same as the one on previous Samsung phones. However, there is a new touch-centric row on the bottom, which allows you to perform the regular phonebook operations easily - call, send message, delete or send business card are all a single touch away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacity of the phonebook itself is 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It can be set to display the names on the phone memory or on the SIM card, or both lists simultaneously. To search the phonebook you need to toggle the alphanumeric keypad and type the first letters of a contact's name. You can only search by first name, although you can choose to order the contact list by last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A large variety of fields is available for each contact. Furthermore, you can add each field more than once, which allows you to add up to 5 numbers per contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that different ringtones and pictures can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ought to mention that contacts can be organized in groups or sent via Bluetooth. The groups can also have their own ringtone or picture but unluckily there is no option for call filtering based on existing groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log has four tabs with the Recent contacts being the default one. Each type of call gets a separate tab too, plus there is also a message and a wireless data counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as call managing is concerned, you can blacklist certain numbers and thus reject all their calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We bet messaging makes you curious<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone handles all four popular types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and email. A single editor is used for creating the first three, while emails have their own. Messages are converted from SMS to EMS or MMS by simply applying font colors or formatting, or by inserting an image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering text is quite intuitive - a single tap on the field highlights it, then a second one invokes the on-screen keypad. As you might have guessed, a rich T9 dictionary is also present here to help with text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good. It can manage up to five accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The email client has a rather fancy semi-transparent file browser used for attaching files to email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SOS message feature is also present in Samsung Armani. It allows quick sending of emergency messages to pre-defined numbers. Recipient numbers should be preset (a max number of 5). The text of your SOS message is not configurable. To send an actual SOS message you should just press the volume rocker 4 times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another security enhancing feature in Samsung Armani is the Mobile Tracker (previously known as uTrack). Its purpose is to send tracking messages to pre-defined numbers in case your phone gets stolen and a SIM card other than yours is inserted. The effectiveness of this particular feature is the subject of a longer discussion, which we would rather not go into at this stage. Suffice to say, having it won't hurt at least.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slow memory reading<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file browser in Samsung Armani is pretty much the same as in most Samsung feature phones. There are different tabs for the phone memory and the memory card but they have similar folder structures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for most different file types - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. The functionality of the file browser is one of the best among non-OS phones. You can copy or move files - both one by one and a multiple selection, and you can create and delete new folders (except for the root ones, which cannot be removed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, you can sort files in a given folder by name, date, type or size to easily locate a specific file. Bluetooth file transfer can also be done one by one or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A flaw we have found in several recent Samsung handsets is unluckily also present in the Armani phone - the unusually slow card reading. So, if you are up to purchasing this handset prepare to be patient when the memory card is accessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani picture gallery is a part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. You can copy or move images but only to the Images folder on the memory card and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image viewing experience offers just the basic stuff - browsing images as thumbnails, zooming in on them, and sending them by email. But boy, is it slow! Browsing images seems like one of the true performance downsides of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can do a bit of editing on your pictures using the integrated Scalado Image Editor, which is quite fast and rich in features. Processing images is quick but editing still takes time since all the features are organized in intricate submenus, which makes applying different effects a rather lengthy process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scalado Image Editor allows you to apply 13 special filters such as stamp, black and white, sepia, negative, milky, antique, fog, moonlight, color boost, posterize, solarize, blur, and sharpen. Then you can get serious with other effects like despeckle, noise, oil paint, emboss, sketch, sketch color, cartoon, paint, frosted glass, magic pen, spotlight, mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also adjust levels, brightness, contrast and color. You can of course flip, rotate and crop the image, as well as apply one of 10 warp styles that make pretty funny portrait images. Options are so many that elaborating on all of them calls for a full-fledged software review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It's got an intriguing music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 60MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung Armani phone will probably seem tempting to many as a portable music player. Therefore it is essential that the music player application is really easy to use and well-supplied feature-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this isn't the case. The music player controls are so intuitive that it seems it's the place where the whole cross-thing originated - the cross-like pattern is just the very essence of music control with the Samsung Armani phone. However changing from one track to another seemed to take ages. Yet again the device is seriously underpowered and is obviously not up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But getting back to the music controls, we think that you would find them interesting enough. The horizontal axis on the music player screen displays the current track running time. Thus moving the cross with your finger can skip portions of the track. A longer horizontal sweep skips to the next track in the playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the cross along the vertical axis too. That changes the current volume level. Additional options allow you to easily change repeat and shuffle settings, the current equalizer preset (there are several of them) and also give the track a rating, to later use for creating favorite playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani is well designed but it's ruined by the slow performance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also available, along with a convenient way for browsing your current playlist and changing albums on the fly. Although "flying" is not the right mind association when we are speaking of the Samsung Armani music performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player allows filtering tracks by artist, album, genre or you can choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice innovation, as compared to older models, is that when minimized to play in the background the music player displays the current track in the standby menu, along with the album art, if any. And you can change tracks straight from the standby screen just by sweeping a finger on the info bar. Be patient though - better yet, go grab a cup of tea while you are waiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, as the Samsung Armani phone features the latest type of the Samsung universal port, we couldn't test the audio quality of the Armani phone music player due to connectivity problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lately Samsung has been implementing this new type of port in its mobile phones such as the Samsung G600 and the Samsung G800. It's not really a big deal unless you've already bought an optional accessory that won't work with the new port (like we did).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good suggestion to Samsung is that when they start changing the system port throughout their portfolio, they should at least enclose some sort of mini converter jack in the retail package too smooth the transition process for the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only complaints we have with the Armani phone music player are that at times it's too slow and the handset itself doesn't have a 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video plays easily too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on Samsung Armani has similar interface to that of the music player. It doesn't have many features but all the essentials are covered - it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos. You can also jump to a specific scene in the video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, MPEG-4 video is among the supported formats. That's also the format the camera records videos in. Fortunately, with MPEG-4 support you can easily convert all your favorite video clips and watch them on the go with Samsung Armani.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel but not enough to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone is equipped with 3 megapixel camera with no auto focus. It's got a LED flash and the maximum image resolution is 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a whole lot of cameraphones on the market right now, but just to cut it short - the Samsung Armani phone is not among them in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, a 2 megapixel module in a high-end device just doesn't cut it anymore (read Nokia N81), so we think installing run-of-the-mill 3 megapixel cameras should be the minimum requirement in the higher-tier handsets to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Armani camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of presenting settings on a toolbar, while options appear as popup menus. The toolbar this time is placed as a column on the right instead of at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic), effects (black and white, sepia, negative), white balance, and viewfinder mode (regular or with status icons on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among all those, an interesting feature is the Mosaic shot seen on previous Samsung handsets too, which allows you to make photo collages - however those turn out in rather low resolution. The Multi-shot mode allows you to take several shots in rapid succession with a single press of the shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional camera settings are accessible from the menu where you can switch between camera and camcorder, as well as turn on the Scene mode. Those settings include stuff like picture quality (normal, fine, superfine), ISO (100-400), exposure metering (matrix, center-weighted and spot), shutter sound (can be set to off), zoom sound, brightness sound, default storage memory and default naming for photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most awkward thing about the Samsung camera interface is that in order to turn the scene mode on, you have to go to those "back-office" settings, select "scenes" and only after that do they appear on the regular settings toolbar. Speaking of those, the available scene modes are auto, indoor, beach, sunset, and dawn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani camera offers medium image quality - it doesn't really fare that well in terms of resolved detail as we would like to, and the digital noise is a little too much. However the color reproduction seems pretty accurate. The dynamic range is not the best too. However we found no traces of purple fringing which Sony Ericsson mobiles tend to produce in excess for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since image quality is never ideal in a mobile phone, it's best to compare it with some other 3 megapixel fixed focus cameras that have had the chance to review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that the Samsung Armani results are slightly better than what Sony Ericsson W890 can put up, while it slightly loses to the 3 megapixel camera of the Samsung E950. Since none of these mobiles is camera-centric one, its safe to conclude that the Armani has a decent run-of-the-mill 3 megapixel camera that would do a good enough job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would like to see more of those regular 3 megapixel cameras in the market midrange instead of the flood of 2 megapixel snappers that keeps coming again and again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some sample camera photos taken with the Samsung Armani camera:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani camera is also able to shoot video - in the so-called Camcorder mode. As with all recent Samsung handsets it records video in up to CIF video resolution (352 x 288 pixels) at 15 fps. If you put up with QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels) you will be able to reach 30 fps. The user interface of the camcorder is pretty much the same as the one of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are captured in MPEG-4 format so they are easily playable on a PC with most video playing software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video, taken with the Samsung Armani phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity-wise Armani is not "hot" couture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, Samsung Armani and high-end just don't rhyme. The handset doesn't feature 3G or HSDPA and the USB slot is the newer wider type. Network data transfers are only carried out via EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP profile support allows listening to your favorite tracks on stereo Bluetooth headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone is equipped with the latest NetFront 3.4 web browser. Usually browsing with this version of the web browser is really nice as it renders pages nicely and correctly. It even offers a webpage mini-map to assist you with horizontal and vertical scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the browser and the touch-based UI just don't mix well. You should forget about using iPhone-style scrolling with your fingers. To navigate around a webpage you should either use the set of virtual arrows that appear at the bottom of the screen or you should rely on finger swipes. Using the finger swipes though won't take you far, as each swipe only takes you a hyperlink away in the desired direction. So effectively you can scroll only one link at a time and that's way too tedious.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is as good as expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. The events available for setting up are three types: appointment, anniversary and task. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level. You can also choose whether your phone should automatically power up upon alarm activation. This feature can be quite handy if you have the habit of switching off your handset at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other organizer offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. You can also use the memo and task applications for making notes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are also available. The voice recorder records in .amr format and has a one-hour recording limitation, which sounds good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator of the Armani phone is as ridiculous as the web browser. The user is forced into constantly switching between number and math function signs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice advantage of all Samsung mobiles is the preinstalled Picsel Viewer, which ensures support for viewing office documents created by Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Adobe Acrobat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Picsel viewer has a plethora of options. However its performance is strictly dependant on the platform it runs on, which when it comes to feature phones is not among the fastest. Handling Excel and Word documents was a breeze, however that cannot be said about the PDF documents.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming is rather limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Armani phone is not packed with games and that's unusual for a Samsung mobile. There is only one game and it's called Photo Puzzle. Its gameplay is quite popular and doesn't need much talking about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Armani phone doesn't have emulated controls for standard Java games (as seen on LG Prada and Viewty), our guess is that it would be impossible to download third-party games. The Photo puzzle one seems specifically developed for the Samsung Armani platform. But who knows!? Java support is there, so if new titles for the Armani phone get developed, you would probably be able to install them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Armani phone by Samsung is a stylish handset and truly a strong fashion statement. The hefty price tag, along with the Armani involvement, is bound to make this device a winner among the fashion savvy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the rest of us though, the Samsung Armani phone is just underpowered. And we don't mean the regular specs here. The Croix user interface is just too demanding on the processing capabilities of the device. While it does seem a little bit out of place to speak about processing power in a fashion-centric device, truth is it ruined the experience for us. The Samsung F700 which features the same UI performs much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if we are to sum it up, the Samsung Armani phone comes with a well balanced set of features, be they not all exactly high-end. It's got a really refined design, it's compact, and there's that hard to resist aura of exclusivity about it. However, being so heavily underpowered and seriously overpriced, it will have a hard time turning into a success.</paragraph>
