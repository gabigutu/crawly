			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A small and sexy music slider ? that?s what the Zylo is. Nothing more, nothing less. Sony Ericsson are probably hoping to start bringing up the next generation of loyal users. You know, give a kid a walkman and they will be coming back for more. The Zylo has the catchy beat and the good looks ? and it?s got the social bug. Music and social networking are perhaps top of the young user?s list of needs and the Zylo meets them at a canter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But besides that, Zylo is a phone for the brokenhearted. A thing to help you remember. And we need to give it to Walkman phones ? there is much to recall fondly. Whether Sony Ericsson are about to breathe new life into the W-brand or just shaking the dust off an old prototype that never got into production, the Zylo deserves credit for keeping the Walkman spirit alive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is a cheap but stylish slider with a Walkman badge. It comes with fast HSPA support, but this is all the high-end connectivity you could expect. There are no premium features such as Wi-Fi and GPS. What puts an upsetting question mark on the whole package is the absence of a 3.5mm audio jack. It?s a cheap phone alright, and we know better than expect a proper audio plug in a Walkman. Doesn?t make sense but that?s how it is. Out of all W-line phones, there?re only two exceptions: the premium W995 and the dirty-cheap Spiro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest feature phones by Sony Ericsson are keen to treat users to great social networking integration. The Zylo is no exception here. It gives you all the social stuff right on the homescreen with a solid widget set running live updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is an excellent small Walkman that?s very easy to like. It is a start-up package, most likely someone?s first phone. And Sony Ericsson want to give the low end a fair try it seems. That?s where Walkman might make sense. They?re giving users something with personality and pedigree to consider against cheap touchscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Another eco-box with no USB cable inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zylo comes in one of those ?eco-friendly? boxes that Sony Ericsson just love to use. It?s really tiny and made of recycled paper. Inside, there?s the energy-efficient charger and a basic pair of headphones on a FastPort connector. A few localized quick guides are also provided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson didn?t bother to supply a data cable. The Zylo uses a FastPort, which means you have to buy one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Zylo 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is a compact, though not super slim, slider measuring 103 x 52 x 16 mm. The phone fits comfortably in the palm both with the keypad slid in or out. It weighs 115g, which is by no means heavy. Very good screen size and comfortable navigation are great things to have in such a small and friendly phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is completely made from plastic but the quality of the finish is fine. We don?t mind the lack of metal ? not in this price range. The Zylo is really solidly built with no body creaks or parts that look vulnerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back and front panels use glossy plastic but the coating is fairly fingerprint resistant. A faux metal frame runs around the handset?s body. The blue rim of the D-pad and the Walkman logo are the only color accents up front. The backside of the slider has a fine dotted pattern that looks good. Although there?s nothing too fancy about the Zylo we agree with Sony Ericsson on this one. The phone has the right balance of style and comfort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomic curve at the rear that we saw in some previous handsets like the Elm and the Hazel is to be seen in the Zylo too. It?s not as prominent as in the GreenHeart family, but still enough to make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is equipped with a 2.6" 16M-color display of QVGA resolution ? perhaps the same unit we already met in the eco-friendly Hazel. The size is a serious advantage: it?s nearly unmatched by feature phones and easily puts some smartphones to shame. The Zylo display is also covered with mineral glass and is said to be scratch resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen image quality is quite good. The QVGA resolution is hardly anything to write home about but the crisp and vibrant images are what really matters here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the Zylo?s display is not nearly as good when it comes to sunlight legibility. In direct sunlight the Zylo is on par with most Sony Ericsson feature phones ? an average score would be fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the lonely earpiece and the Sony Ericsson logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there is a crowded navigation deck centered around a circular D-pad. The layout was a challenge perhaps but the end result is quite user-friendly. Even the smaller keys are tactile and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The circular shapes dominate the setup. The D-pad is just the right size with a very prominent border and an ample center key. The call buttons are curved in and stick to your thumb. Even the smallest round knobs ? Clear key and Activity menu ? are very thumb-friendly. The two soft keys are tiny and perhaps further beneath the screen than you?d think comfortable. In reality, they?re no problem to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is quite good too. Buttons are well sized and solid to press. Nicely curved, they fit easily on your fingers, so quick typing on the Zylo is a cinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson Zylo houses the regular FastPort and the mouthpiece. A standard 3.5mm jack would?ve suited a Walkman phone like the Zylo much better, but no such luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset hosts the volume controls and the Walkman button. The volume rocker is quite small, but its shape and nice response save the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny Walkman key will start the music player instantly. It also doubles as a shutter key when you?ve got the camera on ? it won?t start it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backstage we find the 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera lens with no protection. The loudspeaker grill and the two Sony Ericsson/Walkman logos are also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the Sony Ericsson BST-39 900 mAh Li-Ion battery. It is quoted at up to 400 hours of stand-by and up to 4 hours of talk time. In reality, battery life ranged over three to four days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is ready to accommodate cards of up to 16GB. The phone worked pretty well with our reasonably full 16GB microSD card. The only downside here is that you need to remove the back cover to get to the memory slot. It?s completely hot-swappable though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM compartment is next to the microSD slot, but you need to have removed the battery to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Sony Ericsson Zylo is excellent despite being an all-plastic phone. The solid feel in hand and great palm fit are more than welcome. The styling is retro but there?s some of that old-fashioned quality too that you don?t get too often these days. The slightly curved shape and friendly controls make it especially comfortable to operate. The smooth and solid slider movement and the nice numberpad are worth a mention too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we really miss is a standard 3.5mm audio jack or microUSB port at least - there?s a proprietary FastPort port instead. This is an omission we?re not willing to forgive ? regardless of the phone?s low price and excellent ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is nice as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo has the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI. The Flash interface is well familiar and deservedly praised for its looks, speed and multitasking ability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with status readings on top for signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display are the soft key labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, a 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view. There's nothing that we haven't seen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. The Sony Ericsson Zylo features an inbuilt accelerometer so auto rotation is enabled, but it only works in the Media Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our test unit has four themes preinstalled: Echo, Emersion, Flow and Trace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can use an application as a background instead of an actual image and as of late Sony Ericsson feature phones have widgets on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a total of five homescreen widgets on the Zylo: Facebook, Music Genie, MySpace, Twitter and Walk Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the preloaded widgets takes almost the whole standby screen, so you can only have one visible at a time. But they can all be working at once and easily switched between using the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get to select which widgets will be active and you may choose to enable all of them. Pressing the Up key on the D-pad lets you manage the widgets and set their behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walk Mate should be familiar to Sony Ericsson users ? a simple step-counter, which works in the background. It has a green twist this time around and is aptly called Walk Mate Eco ? it converts your walking exercise into saved CO2 emissions, which of course only makes sense if you?re walking outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Music Genie widget, it is a shortcut to the Dance! Music Genie game as well as to the Message composer, Phonebook, Web browser, Calendar and the Alarm apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The good old phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to auto save to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your entire contact list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to sort contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known to anyone that has used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception issues with the Sony Ericsson Zylo. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zylo supports video calls but since it lacks a dedicated video-call camera, you?ll have to use the main one on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It consists of four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the most recent one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo scored a Good mark in our traditional loudspeaker test. You should have no problems hearing it in all but the noisiest environments. The vibration strength was OK as well. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is traditionally excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. The phone also supports push email but can't handle any attached documents (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like all the recent Sony Ericsson phones, the Sony Ericsson Zylo has enhanced message sorting - the so-called Conversations mode, a.k.a. Threaded messaging. We missed a preinstalled IM client though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to Conversations mode - it is the alternative conversation-style layout and displays messages in threads. All texts to or from a certain contact are displayed in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger program.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course predictive typing. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor. SMS can be easily converted into MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, the Sony Ericsson Zylo also offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Each message can also be sorted into one of six categories - Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important ? but you can create new categories as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email application failed to retrieve the settings for our Gmail account automatically ? by now we?re used to the phones doing most of that work for us. On the upside, the app supports push notifications if you?ve got a push-enabled email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the file type is incompatible with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson Zylo (much like all other Sony Ericsson feature phones) can't preview any documents including the ones attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of any document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Media Center is the place for fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo runs the flash-based Media Center. Its menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons. As we already said, there's an accelerometer on board so auto screen rotation is enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Zylo has the latest Walkman player. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player is compatible with numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. Surprisingly, the Zylo also supports the HD FLAC audio format ? an open-source lossless audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes. The Walkman player on the Zylo also offers fun Styles ? skins that change the look of the player into a vinyl record player, a reel-to-reel tape player, CD player and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no shake control however, despite the built-in accelerometer. It is a hip feature ? on phones that support it you can skip songs or even shuffle the playlist by just a flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A familiar Walkman goodie, SensMe, offers a different approach to populating a playlist. It automatically generates playlists based on what tempo and what mood you want ? fast or slow, sad or happy. Songs need to be tagged, which is only possible with the Sony Ericsson?s PC software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is also present ? it analyzes the currently playing song on the radio or whatever it picks up with its mic and retrieves the performer and name of the song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken along with the pre-bundled wallpapers. Luckily, auto rotation is available so you can still rotate images to landscape orientation not only manually but automatically as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are generally displayed as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs. The shots in the dedicated Camera Album are sorted by the date they were taken on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an image makes the thumb zoom in to fullscreen view mode, while exiting the fullscreen view zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Photo gallery can get quite laggy when there are a lot of photos in a folder. At times, the phone froze for a couple of seconds before moving on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The dedicated Photo viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson has no inbuilt GPS receiver but it still can geotag camera images (using Cell-ID). Then, you can use the View on map option in the image gallery. It allows you to check the place where the shot has been taken directly on the map using the preinstalled Google Maps application (data charges may apply).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does subtitles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player in the Media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Display mode automatically switches when the phone is rotated. It works with the MP4 and 3GP video formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can also show subtitles, it handles the .SRT format. Subtitles are displayed against black background. We wish this was more customizable ? options like text size, background opacity and so on would have been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video section also keeps the pre-installed YouTube client, which gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt FM radio of the Sony Ericsson Zylo has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly the audio quality of Walkman-branded Sony Ericsson Zylo is great. The handset performed excellently in each and every part of our traditional tests, scoring some pretty nice results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is perfect for the entire audible range, the greatest deviation being hard to detect even in lab conditions. The signal-to-noise ratio is also excellent and so are the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortions are also neatly kept under control and if it wasn't for it being slightly on the quiet side we would pronounce the Zylo a perfect portable audio player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Zylo and Hazel frequency response graphs match perfectly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel fixed-focus snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you already know by now, the Sony Ericsson Zylo has a 3 megapixel camera capable of producing images at a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. There is no LED flash on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features include user-controlled white balance, shot and metering mode, geotagging, a self-timer and various color effects. You can capture panos by taking three consecutive shots using the dedicated shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has the familiar user interface. Its pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings are here to facilitate the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo is capable of putting standard positioning coordinates in images using Cell-ID. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one shortcoming that concerns the one-way camera menu layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar as it's the last item there. Looped scrolling of items on the toolbar should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo snapper managed to impress us. We?re used to seeing images affected by too aggressive processing. Well, this is not the case here. That means that you?ll have to add some final touches to the images taken with the Zylo but that certainly is the better case scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast and colors are fine and there isn?t much noise to see. We were glad to notice that there were no artifacts caused by oversharpening. As for the amount of detail, it is fair for a 3-megapixel shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As there is no autofocus, close-ups are a no-go for the Zylo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a handful of camera samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson Zylo. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Zylo is also capable of capturing video - VGA resolution at 24fps. Clips are recorded in MP4 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video stacks up pretty well against the VGA-recording crowd. There are compression artifacts and the occasional doubled frame, but unfortunately this seems common in the mobile phone world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo scores average on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G (two localized versions with dual-band and single-band network support) are all on board as is HSDPA (7.2 Mbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson Zylo offers the usual Bluetooth v2.1 and USB options, though you?d need a Sony Ericsson Fast Port to USB converter. There is also A2DP support allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s the hot swappable microSD card ? it is the fastest way to transfer large amounts of data.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice web browser to match the great screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo comes with the nice Access NetFront web browser v3.5 featuring the extended home screen, also available in the other recent Sony Ericsson handsets. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen right under a search and an address bar. The appearance of the home screen changes to a different bright color each time you start the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. There is a full screen mode both in portrait and landscape view. Auto-rotation works like a charm and the panning/scrolling speed is up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer that?s nice to work with. For YouTube, you have a dedicated application, which launches automatically when you try to view a YouTube video. There is also support for RSS feeds and on-page search, while copying text or downloading pictures off a page are not a problem for the Zylo browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We experienced some lags in the browser however. Nothing major, nor too common, but still noticeable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo offers a wide range of time-management features as usual for its class. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: a File manager, Java Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, a Stopwatch and a Calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you save a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar too. There is just one general-purpose type of entry in the Calendar, but it features enough details. Notes are composed similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms application hardly needs any explanation. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Zylo comes with some of the usual apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather application gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest. An overview of current conditions and a three day forecast is available for a great number of cities around the world. You should bear in mind that the data is downloaded in real time so data charges apply. Not that we can think of any other way for the application to work but we still feel a warning is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Quiz tests your knowledge of songs - it plays samples of your music library and asks you to name the song. The Checkbook allows you to create different accounts, enter a balance and start managing them (income and expenses). There is also a graphical chart for easy tracking of your transactions over time. The NeoReader is a barcode scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on board are the popular Facebook, YouTube and Google Maps applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the preloaded games, the Zylo packs a hefty eight. Half of them are full versions (Dance! Music Genie, LoccoRocco, Powerboat Challenge, and Quadrapop), while the rest are all demos (BejeweledTwist, Brick Breaker, Bubble Town, and Luxor Quest).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dance! Music Genie is supposed to teach you how to dance (sort of). You pick a song and press the button shown on the screen. Occasionally, you?ll also need to shake the phone to get your health recovered. Powerboat Challenge is a boat racing game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrapop is a Tetris replica, this time with some colorful creatures instead of bricks. As for LocoRoco, this is a very kid-friendly fun physics-based game.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Traditional sliders are a dying breed so having one of them for a few days made for a refreshing change. And a Walkman at that ? someone at Sony Ericsson must have been feeling nostalgic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, let?s face it, the Sony Ericsson Zylo can?t do all that much. But if this phone is to sell ? which we think it will ? it won?t be for the tech inside. The Zylo looks nice, feels great in the hand and has decent equipment for a mobile phone that costs about a hundred euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s difficult to pin down the defining feature of the Zylo. It has a 3-megapixel camera capable of VGA video recording, a nice music player, as well as solid social networking integration and fast data. There are plenty of apps and games and you also get a large 2.6? display for good measure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is still far away from being perfect, though. But while we think there?s no need to fuss over imaging or connectivity in an entry level package, there?s one thing ? and not a big thing either ? that could?ve made a lot of sense. 3.5 mm audio jacks are hard to find in Walkman phones to begin with but how hard could this be? If the Spiro can have it why can?t the Zylo?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What makes it even stranger is that the Spiro is obviously the lesser ? and cheaper ? package of the two. But let?s take a look at some more devices that are more or less similar to the Sony Ericsson Zylo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Zylo ? Sony Ericsson Spiro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite fortunately perhaps, two of Zylo?s very viable alternatives are signed by Sony Ericsson. The Sony Ericsson Yari and the more recent Hazel have been around for a while and cost less than they did at launch. For around 160 euro (50 euro more than the Zylo?s current street price) you get a large 16M-color screen (measuring 2.4 or 2.6 inches) and 5MP autofocus imaging. And the Hazel even tops that with Wi-Fi, GPS, active noise cancellation and a splash-resistant design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Yari ? Sony Ericsson Hazel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60-based Nokia 6700 slide is in the vicinity of 160 euro as well. Like the other two, it features a 5-megapixel sharpshooter (an excellent one, too), but on top of that it?s clad in aluminum and comes in numerous colors. Bear in mind though that its display is notably smaller (2.2 inches) and there is no Wi-Fi support (unlike the Hazel).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Nokia X3 is the most likely Zylo rival. The X3 is a feature phone that costs around 100 euro, has dedicated music controls and a 3MP fixed-focus camera. Sound familiar? It should. The only thing is, the X3 screen is smaller and there?s no 3G connectivity. But the 3.5mm audio jack is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6700 slide ? Nokia X3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe none of the Sony Ericsson Zylo disadvantages is a true deal breaker and the reasonable price tag is a welcome sign for many young users. There seems to be plenty of choice in the low end but character and personality are scarce. The Walkman branding is in a way an invitation to a fresh set of customers to start a new love affair with Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
