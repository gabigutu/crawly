			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The words "Black Label" evoke images of things exclusive, reserved for the lucky few. The new entrant in the arena, the LG BL40 New Chocolate, the intriguing successor of highly popular style-conscious phones such as the Chocolate, Shine and Secret, fully deserves the honor. It looks like the kind of gadget that is always on the other side of the store window or in the hands of someone demonstrating a prototype that never sees the light of day. But the LG BL40 New Chocolate is quite real and it's here to stay and fight for market success - in fact LG announced today the New Chocolate will hit the European market in mid-September this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unorthodox long shape definitely sets it apart and the glossy black plastic with careful touches of silver trim easily remind of the times we first saw the LG Chocolate in flesh. The LG BL40 New Chocolate is immensely sleek and the 4-inch screen with 21:9 aspect ratio easily makes it one of the most unusual mobile phones that have set foot in our office this year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG BL40 New Chocolate at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some other fashionable handsets out there, the LG BL40 New Chocolate beauty is not skin deep - the hardware has all the bells and whistles a modern high-end gadget should have. And though technically not a smartphone, the BL40 New Chocolate S-class user interface offers convenient multitasking and is polished to match the sleek exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a brilliant screen with aspect ratio shared only with cinema screens and a few home cinema oriented TVs you can be sure the LG BL40 New Chocolate is a star. It certainly is no introvert - with TV out and DivX/XviD support, along with Dolby mobile plus an FM transmitter, we guess you can say that the LG BL40 New Chocolate broadcasts on all frequencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera and connectivity prowess of the phone do great job of covering all the advanced features found on phones today. So, it's got the looks and it's got the brains. Will its extravagance make it a hit or an oddity?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the jump, you can see the LG BL40 New Chocolate do a 360-degree spin for you while we take a closer look at its hardware. Just keep in mind it's an early version we're working with and some design elements might go through changes before the handset hits the market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG BL40 New Chocolate 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the bar form factor isn't anything close to revolutionary, the LG BL40 New Chocolate proportions certainly are what makes it stand out of the crowd.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The few hardware buttons on the LG BL40 New Chocolate make a nice job of blending in with the styling of the phone - especially those on the sides. The power/lock button on top is a little more prominent but it's also probably the most used physical button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With touchscreen bars, the front is usually dominated by the screen, but here even "dominated" sounds like an understatement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside it the front panel hosts the earpiece, the videocall camera, proximity and ambient light sensors. Since the camera and sensors are not very noticeable, the screen seems to be the only thing at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of course the centerpiece of not only the front, but also the entire phone. While 21:9 aspect ratio is common in cinema and relatively rare in TVs, in mobile phones it's one of a kind. And along with the regular functionality, the BL40 New Chocolate screen also offers multitouch, thanks to its capacitive touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4-inch display is a real treat - the touch sensitivity is top-notch, registering even very light taps. And the sunlight legibility, which has been a problem of earlier LG handsets, is a great surprise - provided there aren't too many smudges on the screen it performs excellently under direct sunlight. The screen has probably gotten some new sort of coating that improves the things by far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG BL40 New Chocolate may not be iPhone-good in direct sunlight, but it's close. Not to mention it has quite a few more pixels on screen than the iPhone. The colors are vibrant - the picture quality makes watching videos a nice experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the LG BL40 New Chocolate has a single key, which opens the Call history (its need dictated by the lack of any call keys whatsoever). The microUSB port is on this side as well, and it's got the same latch cover as LG Crystal - it's probably the most convenient microUSB cover introduced by any handset manufacturer so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BL40 New Chocolate houses the volume rocker and the shutter key. While the other keys on the side are as thin as the silver strip lining running around the phone, the shutter key is wider and round, making it easier to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm audio jack and the Lock/Power key. Both are easy to access and nice to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom looks like a mirror image of the top from a distance, making the phone symmetrical. It's not however - it's plain, save for the mic hole. Still, at times you will find yourself wondering which way is up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back follows the same "cleaner is better" mantra as the front. The 5-megapixel camera is here alongside the LED flash and a hole for a second microphone - this allows the BL40 New Chocolate record better audio for your video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Schneider-Kreuznach logo is right next to the camera of course, a testament to its pedigree. There's nothing to protect it from scratches so you'd need to be careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover comes off easily - just slide down to open it. It's very solid and has no wobble or creaks to it. Opening it reveals a 1000 mAh battery, the SIM card slot and the microSD card, which unfortunately is hidden here but can still be accessed without removing the battery istelf.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that glossy plastic on the back however comes at a price. There isn't a fingerprint that it won't catch and the screen isn't any better. Taking the BL40 New Chocolate out in the sun reveals smudges all over, and if you don't compulsively wipe the phone every time you take it out, you'd better start because this is a phone that needs to look its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate feels heavy in the hand but not unpleasantly so. It will take you some time to find a convenient hand-hold position, in which the four corners on the screen are within your thumb's reach and you're not risking the phone tumbling over due to its higher center of mass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the next stretch of the preview (pun intended), we take a look at the new shiny S-Class UI that makes this phone tick. Jump on!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The tallest S-Class ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class UI has already taken honorable place among the rest of the most popular mobile user interfaces today. Since the first S-Class device - the LG KM900 Arena - the other two implementations in the Viewty Smart and the Crystal did not bring any significant visual or functional change. Well, the LG BL40 New Chocolate promises to change that by taking full advantage of the 4-inch super wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cube interface is still the base for the homescreen layout - four homescreens corresponding to the four faces of the 3D cube that is some sort of symbol of the S-class UI. You activate it by pressing the dedicated Cube button in the bottom right corner of the screen while you are at one of the available homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has got it just right and the visuals of the S-class interface are spectacular - everything from homescreen to dropdown menus roll, sweep in, unfold and rotate extra smoothly with a responsiveness that suggests some powerful graphics acceleration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have finally swapped the impractical Multimedia homescreen with a new Browser one. There you can assign quick shortcuts to your favorite web pages - just as you can on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three other homescreens are standard issue stuff - Contacts, Widgets and Shortcut. As you might expect, with the larger screen, there's now more real estate for widgets and shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has also been changed and this time we like it much more. Instead of the previous "Press &amp; Hold to Unlock" we have "Slide Up to Unlock". You need to press and slide the wallpaper up to reveal the homescreen. Though this procedure seems influenced by the iPhone slide-to-unlock thingy, we still find it original enough to deserve a pat on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were many users complaining about the fixed wallpapers on the homescreens. That's been fixed now - in the Screen Settings menu you'll find various options to change all wallpapers throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. It has the usual layout of four rows of menu items, which are scrollable horizontally. That way almost all menu items are accessible simultaneously without jumping from tab to tab, as was the case with the older LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you turn the phone sideways, the menu items are all visualized with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG BL40 New Chocolate the menu icons are now styled in 3D accompanied with some visual effects, but if you like the old 2D menu there is an option to toggle it back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the official press materials, the LG BL40 New Chocolate should also have some clever gesture based app launcher - we can only guess it should be something along the lines of Samsung Smart Unlock feature, as we didn't actually have that one on our early LG BL40 sample. With the new Gesture Shortucts as LG call them, you can choose among twelve on-screen gestures and assign them various features or applications. As we already said, we are yet to see this one in action.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huge QWERTY with various options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the LG BL40 New Chocolate offers an onscreen alphanumeric keypad in portrait orientation and a landscape QWERTY thumboard. This time though the QWERTY keys are big enough and it is much harder to tap the wrong key. Each symbol you tap is clearly marked by iPhone-style pop-ups. The huge screen has allowed for larger Favorites and Contacts shortcuts on the SMS screen, which have replaced the small square buttons from the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client has a complete new look. When in the normal orientation it's the same as in the older S-Class version, but turning the BL40 New Chocolate to landscape mode reveals a much more comfortable interface. The message headers are sorted in a column on the left side of the screen, while on the right you can read the selected email. This type of UI resembles the standard desktop email clients such as Outlook or Thunderbird and we are sure it will be heartily welcomed by those looking for PC-like behavior from their phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The better gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our BL40 New Chocolate Chocolate pre-production unit offered two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid while in landscape mode one image is displayed in the center and two more on either side in an impressive 3D spatial view. In fact they are the same as in the Arena, Viewty2 and Crystal, but this is a very early version of the software and we expect some improvements in the final product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi-touch is also part of the gallery, allowing for the pinch-to-zoom gesture happily borrowed from the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Monster media<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is the same as these in the previous S-Class feature phones. The only new upgrades are the Shuffle button above every playlist (just like Apple iPhone) and the prettier landscape mode, which has been made possible by the wider aspect screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the music player hasn't changed much since the Arena or the Crystal, the video player has been completely overhauled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It managed to play all the DivX movies we threw at it, though the XviD videos playback was a bit more of a hit-and-miss affair. We hope the final version of the UI will have those glitches all cleared up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the TV enthusiasts there is a quick shortcut to the TV-out settings if you need to play the videos on a big screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no playlist options at this stage, but the player will play the next video in the current folder after finishing the present one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dolby Mobile is available on the video player and is turned on by default. And just so you know, its potential is best appreciated through headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the LG Arena, the New Chocolate sports both FM radio and an FM transmitter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixels still count for something<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate sports a 5 megapixel camera with Schneider-Kreuznach lens and a LED flash. It's capable of taking photos with maximum resolution 2560x1920 and features image stabilization, geo-tagging, face tracking, blink and smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate comes with the revamped camera interface, resembling that on the Viewty Smart. Access to all the camera settings is via the left taskbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for Scene mode, flash, focus mode (auto/macro), advanced settings and Homescreen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate Advanced settings camera menu is a clever rotating dial (digicam style) with the available options for each setting displayed as a list on the right. The interface is very handy, neat and usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another bar on the right hand-side of the screen. It offers a virtual shutter key plus exit and gallery buttons. This bar is fixed and is not transparent - instead it's permanently laced there to get around the wide aspect ratio of the LG BL40 New Chocolate screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two scroll bars on both sides of the viewfinder - one for zooming and one for the brightness adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the new Intelligent shot mode, which picks the best scene preset according to the shooting conditions and the subject. It's the first time that we've seen a feature like this implemented on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since our pre-production BL40 New Chocolate unit produced nice photos with decent levels of detail and pleasant colors, we decided to publish some of the samples we took. The noise reduction algorithms have not been fully refined yet and sometimes they blur the fine details. At some places there's extreme oversharpening (the buildings edges, for instance), but as we warned you this is just an early pre-production sample. Presumably a lot of those things will be fixed in the final version and we expect the image quality to be at least on a par with the LG Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the video recording didn't work well on our unit, so we can't provide you with any samples. The BL40 New Chocolate is expected to capture videos with VGA resolution at 30 fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BL40 New Chocolate has a gorgeous display and its user interface is among the best in the "touch feature phone" class. With a more polished and more customizable UI, a nice music player and excellent video playback support, the LG BL40 New Chocolate is much closer to what the LG Arena should have been in the first place. But as we see quite often, manufacturers always leave some room for improvement to help differentiate their future products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-off form factor and the first of its kind 4-inch display will certainly help the LG BL40 New Chocolate stand out among its competitors, there's no doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's pretty much all there is to note about our pre-release LG BL40 New Chocolate. Fortunately, the official LG promo material promises even more new stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, there will be new SatNav software ? the Wisepilot for LG, which should solve the lack of adequate navigation in the LG phones. Next is the enhanced 3D gallery that's even fancier than the current one, new UI functionality in landscape mode and even more eye-pleasing effects. Combine that with Wi-Fi, a better web browser and a 5 megapixel snapper and the LG BL40 New Chocolate begins to sound like a top-notch multimedia gadget - and a fashionable one, we might add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The New Chocolate is an intriguing and aesthetically striking multimedia gadget. The new form factor is certainly going to divide people: you will either love or hate it. However, its odd looks might work against it and the BL40 New Chocolate may never be as popular as say, the LG Arena. But our team here at GSMArena.com loves to see technology evolve and lately LG have been giving us quite a few reasons to celebrate.</paragraph>
