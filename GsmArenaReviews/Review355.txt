			<paragraph>You all know Nokia E61 ? it?s been among the most popular Nokia smartphones ever since it was presented. Its fans have always been divided over it not having a camera. Taking that into account Nokia decided to release an updated version of the handset marked with ?i?. Besides a camera, the new model features a number of small modifications, or otherwise upgrades, which would again reinstate it as a top-notch smartphone messenger. Now join us on our GSMArena journey which would try to answer a good deal of questions for you? and for us, for that matter.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Right from the start the Nokia E61 was a successful model that made itself a nice group of dedicated fans. Not having a camera was obviously not a big deal for those guys. Even now in workplaces where information confidentiality is strictly guarded, cameraphones are simply not allowed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The business messenger market though realized that office workers and businessmen need an all-in-one tool that would allow them to work efficiently during the day and to have fun or just relax in the evenings and weekend. So essentially it has come to this that purely business handsets are gradually being equipped with more and more extra features such as a music player, a video player, a camera, etc. The market niche for such devices is fiercely competitive and it seems that our new Nokia has plunged into the deep with some other serious swimmers such as Palm Treo, Blackberry Pearl, Motorola Q, HTC S620, Sony Ericsson M600, Samsung i320, iMate JAQ plus several HP IPAQ products. And if you look at the details, the Nokia E61i is even functionally identical to Nokia E70.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia E61i and Nokia E70: functionally identical but so much different</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we started to review the new Nokia E61i we came up with a couple of key questions that had to be answered in order for this review to be complete and those are:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same time the review had to cover all the aspects that we cover in all other reviews ? meaning that we should go over all the features of the smartphone in detail. So for those of you that are into smartphones for a long time now and wouldn?t want to go through all of this, here is our low down on exactly how the Nokia E61i differs from the vanilla E61.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E61i is thinner than the E61 by a small margin but is 11 cc smaller. The E61i has a better build quality over the E61 and possesses a rather stable and solid body. The keyboard has definitely got a few updates ? first, the navigation joystick is replaced with a D-pad, which is a great choice by the way. Then there are two new shortcut keys ? the Phonebook and My Own key. The My Own key is a customizable shortcut key that you can use for starting an application of your choice. The keys of the QWERTY keyboard have gotten just a notch smaller, but the space between them has increased. Furthermore their tactile feedback is far better on E61i than on the E61. As a result the ergonomics of the QWERTY keyboard have greatly increased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software-wise the E61i didn?t stay long enough in development so that it can get the Feature Pack 1, that?s now available for the S60 user interface. So obviously we would be waiting for other devices to try it on. Nevertheless, the E61i comes with several preinstalled applications that were not available in E61 ? the WLAN Wizard, the Search application and the Team Suite. The WLAN wizard is a Wi-Fi network scanner, Search is a global search engine for your handset contents and finally, the Team suite is a more specific application that allows for creating so-called ?teams? in order to make mass communication with your colleagues easier. Having those applications is not a big deal, though, as they can be downloaded to your E61, too. The E61i also has newer and more user-friendly Internet calling settings and finally, let?s not forget ? the new messenger comes with a 2 megapixel camera that can always come in handy for making snapshots of people and places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what are the answers to the two questions we had, you might ask. Well, for that, our friends, you?ll have to bear with us to this review?s very end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as retail package is concerned, the box contents you should expect are the Nokia HS-5 headset and a data cable. Nothing more to please the eye ? but hey, the E-series handsets are all about business.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Enter the Dragon<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being an updated version of the Nokia E61, the Nokia E61i has pretty much the same design as its predecessor. The dimensions are identical too - the Nokia E61i measures 117 x 70 x 13.9 mm and weighs 150 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are more than pleased with the construction quality of the E61i. The handset didn?t produce any creaks during our test, and furthermore it didn?t look like those are likely to show up even after months of use. As we already said the body construction and the way parts fit together is something that has improved over E61.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E61i all over</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well going over the phone you couldn?t help but notice the LED in the upper left corner of the front panel. It is in fact an ambient light detector which is used for power optimization. It detects the available ambient light and thus controls whether backlighting or display brightness should be adjusted. It also serves the double purpose of an event light alerting you of different event ? a feature that is totally customizable. Next to the LED/sensor, right in the dead center, is the in-call speaker grill. Due to the really wide form factor, it takes some time to get used to position your ear right on the speaker. Unaccustomed to it, during our tests we often tended to go left or right. Next to it is the On/Off key ? it?s made of white rubber that somehow doesn?t follow the metallic design of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia E61i top part: LED/light sensor and On/Off key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keypad is probably the most exciting thing about a handset with that form factor. It is the single thing that can make or break the pleasure of using the device to its full potential. As you would see later on in the review, the Nokia E61i keyboard manages to impress with a great usability. One can easily notice that there are several design updates over the E61 ? all for the better, we might add. You might have noticed that the keyboard of our test unit is in fact not a QWERTY one, but instead a QWERTZ one. The simple reason for that is that it is the German version of E61i ? fully localized with the added special characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E61i keyboard: design has changed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device features a dual volume key and the voice key. A single press allows you to start an immediate recording of a voice note for example. A longer press takes you to the voice dial/voice command interface. The voice key is pretty well recessed so it isn?t probable that you would press it accidentally in your pocket ? a flaw that Nokia E61 had. Beside those keys is the loudspeaker grill ? the sound it produces is nice ? clear and loud. The loudspeaker position is well-thought of, as the sound doesn?t get muffled when you put down the handset on its back, as is the case with most current mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Left side view: voice key, volume key, loudspeaker</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the device features the charger port, the Pop port for connecting the data cable and the headset, as well as the Infrared port. The charger port of the E61i can fit only the latest types of Nokia chargers ? the ones with a thinner jack. Unlike N-series handsets the E61i doesn?t come with a charger adaptor included which would allow for using the older types of chargers with it. Strangely enough, although we had that type of adapter we couldn?t charge the E61i with an older charger. It seems that with this model Nokia has left behind the backwards compatibility we were used to see. The right and top sides of the handset don?t accommodate any control elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Bottom side view ? Right side view ? Top side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn the phone over, you would see that its back is pretty bare. The only element that really catches your eye is the 2 megapixel camera lens. The lens is protected by a silver circular ring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E61i back ? camera lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most of the back is taken by the fully metallic battery cover. Removing it is done with a slide ? much like inserting it back on. Note that we say ?inserting? ? the cover has to be inserted into tracks which allow it to slide all the way to the top. Now it isn?t the most comfortable solution we?ve seen but it surely is among the most secure ones. When you remove the back cover the large Nokia BP-4L Li-Polymer battery is revealed. It has a capacity of the impressive 1500 mAh and is manufacturer-rated to be able to sustain the handset with power for up to 400 h in standby, and for up to 9 h of talk time in GSM-only networks. Our test showed that when used moderately in a UMTS network the E61i was able to offer the impressive six full days with a single charging ? and that being the first one for the battery. When we say moderately we mean that the E61i almost never left our office and for those six days we did a total of around 35 minutes of talking, 1 hour of Bluetoothing, 30 minutes of WLAN web browsing, 2 hours of listening to music, 40 minutes of playing video, taking several dozens of pictures, and a lot of fiddling with the phone. So just to sum up for you ? it is a nice mark for Nokia?s latest messenger smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Removing the back panel ? memory card slot ? 1500 mAh battery ? SIM card bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although being rather wide, the Nokia E61i feels pretty much comfortable when held in hand. If you try to work with it single-handedly and if you are dexterous enough to hold it in your right hand and to navigate with your thumb, you mind find that the left soft keys are a bit too far for you to press accurately. If you have bigger hands, that surely wouldn?t pose any problem. The smartphone leaves an impression of a thin, stable and user-friendly handset ? although a side jog dial would have come in handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Typing a? message perhaps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, we must admit that the E61i keyboard left us full of nothing but nice experience. It?s well designed and spacey, keys have a positive feedback and all in all ? it is a great instrument to help you do all your emails. As we already said, a number of changes have been introduced over E61 - the navigation joystick is replaced with a D-pad, there are two new shortcut keys ? the Phonebook and My Own key, and the keys have gotten just a notch smaller, but the space between them has increased. The backlighting is strong and even.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> E61i keyboard in the dark: nice and even</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E61i has an extremely large 16M color TFT display with a QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution ? it measures a good 2.8 inches in diagonal which is close to PocketPC displays. Just as those, it looks pretty vulnerable in the beginning due to the large exposed surface. When it comes to performance under bright sunlight? Let?s just say that in this respect Nokia have been doing some really great work lately ? their displays are among the best ones we?ve seen ? both on feature phones and on smartphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Making calls?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i signal reception is just what you would expect from a high-end smartphone - flawless. The loudspeaker of the phone is also good, and as we already mentioned ? due to its position it is hard to muffle it in your pocket or when you put it on a table. Ringtone volume is sufficient enough and is audible even in crowded places. The vibration of the phone is also strong enough. The phone has brilliant speaker quality and the sound during calls is very clear and without any interferences.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Taking it further...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i runs on the third edition of the Series 60 UI. The Symbian operating system works very well on the phone and is quite fast. We are quite pleased with the response of the operating system and would recommend it sincerely when it comes to smartphones. As regards the response of E61i over previous E-series devices (with the latest firmware installed) we found it to be exactly the same in terms of its speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display contains information about the network coverage, the battery status, date, time, operator name. There is also the Active stand-by screen which shows a bar with 7 shortcuts plus several plug-ins and the inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E61i: with and without the Active Standby ? Active standby plug-ins </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new My Own key that seems to appear on Nokia?s new smartphones is a customizable shortcut key that you can use for starting an application of your choice. It really comes in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> My Own key settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an Offline mode which works as an Airplane mode, switching off the phone functionality of Nokia E61i but allowing the user to use the other capabilities of the device. The Offline mode can also be used if you don?t insert a SIM card in the phone. While in offline mode the phone can still provide WLAN and Bluetooth connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any smartphone, there is a Task Manager, of course. It gets opened by a longer press on the Menu key on the keyboard. This pop-up allows you to switch between applications or you can end them. Generally, the red receiver key closes applications for real, so if you need to leave one running, you can always return to Standby using this Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Task manager pop-up</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s main menu can be viewed either as a matrix grid of 4 x 3 icons or in list view. Most of the submenus also allow changing the type of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main Menu: grid view and list view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i has 60 MB internal memory and a microSD memory card slot. Unfortunately, as it seems the retail package of the E61i won?t be including a memory card. You will have to buy one of your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all recent Symbian smartphones, a great feature of Nokia E61i is the voice recognition system which can be used both for dialing contacts and starting applications. It doesn?t need to have your commands pre-recorded, in fact it handles most of the voice commands you give it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Voice recognition menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer uses the Dots theme as default in most of its latest smartphones. If you wish you can use the standard blue Nokia theme. The themes don?t seem to make significant changes to the user interface. They only change the wallpaper and the color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standard Nokia and Dot themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i has six default ringing profiles (including the Offline mode). The user can create custom profiles as easily as can modify the existing ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Available profiles</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook... know no boundaries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia E61i looks just like a normal Nokia Symbian phonebook. It has no limit of the contacts as it uses the phone?s free memory and thus can hold an enormous amount of entries. They can be ordered either by first or last name and can be searched by letter-by-letter typing of the desired name. The phonebook can be accessed by the dedicated shortcut key on the keyboard as well as from the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New contacts can be assigned more than 30 different fields and numbers. Naturally, you can assign ringtones and pictures to contacts of your choice, but we couldn't find an option to assign a personal video clip. Synchronization with PC works seamlessly, too. You can actually rename the predefined fields of the phonebook and thus customize them to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Various fields ? Renaming a label</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log of Nokia E61i contains three tabs for Dialed, Received and Missed calls. Every tab can hold up to 10 call records with their date and time. However, if you enter the Log application, you will find yourself in a list of all call records and data transfers and sessions which have taken place in the last 30 days. This includes even the WLAN connections.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The keyboard is among the finest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing messages works like a charm. As always QWERTY keyboards are our favorites when it comes to typing messages. We said enough on the E61i?s keypad previously in this review, but just to sum it up - it is a great instrument to help you do all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor displays a counter of the characters left of the 160 limit. It also displays in brackets the number of separate messages the message will be divided into. The display allows 6 lines to be shown en bloc. Delivery reports appear on the screen when the keypad is not locked. After that, they are stored in a separate folder in the Messaging sub-menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor is very intuitive and easy to use. Multiple email accounts are supported. E61i works with POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. The email client can download either the headers only or the full messages. Attachments are supported as well. This email client manages most user needs regarding email communication. Among its strongest advantages is the support for various third-party mail services such as the RIM BlackBerry Connect for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing tracks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music Player of the Nokia E61i is nice. It has an equalizer and supports Playlists. It?s not on par with the players of some dedicated music phones but it does its job satisfactory. The supported file formats are MP3, AAC, m4a, eAAC+ and WMA. Of course, the player can run in the background. The controls of the player are very intuitive. It also manages M3U playlist format seamlessly and can even handle the file automatically if it is placed in the same directory as the music files. A good advice to the users is to use USB 2.0 card readers for transferring music files to the memory card as this way is much faster than the Nokia Pop-port transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia E61i music player ? Options ? Equalizer</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has a Real Player and a Flash player preinstalled. The video can be watched in full screen if you press the 2 key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Watching a video with the Real Player: windowed and full screen</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Old school gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like in all E-series models, the E61i doesn?t have the rotating gallery we?ve come to know from N-series smartphones. Images and videos are presented in list view only. Other than that, there are no differences in terms of functionality. You can view the pictures and videos both in portrait and landscape framed mode as well as in full screen mode with no visible borders at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Gallery ? Image gallery in list view ? Opening a picture </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick a picture you can zoom it in up to 8 times and view it in great detail. The actual zooming is generally fast as is the overall multimedia performance of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Zooming in on a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the gallery has nice file-manager functionality, meaning that you can select and send multiple files. Besides that the smartphone has the usual file manager that does its job pretty satisfactory when it comes to filtering files according to the memory used, marking, moving, copying and managing files. As for application management there is also a separate Application manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Symbian OS file manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i features one especially useful application ? ?Search?. Here is how it works: with the time items in you phone start to pile and you start to slowly lose your grip. Thanks to ?Search? you do not have to spend time in organizing them. ?Search? helps you search through all your messages, emails, events in your calendar, your contacts, other files, tasks and notes, or even a random combination of the above mentioned items. Even though phone?s content is not indexed anywhere, searching takes no more than a few seconds before you are offered a satisfying result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Using the Search application</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What?s that thing on the back panel?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most obvious upgrade of the Nokia E61i over the previous E61 version is without a doubt the added 2 megapixel camera. The camera is a sensitive feature in work environments where information protection is enforced by all means necessary ? meaning that employees are not allowed to have cameraphones. But yet Nokia realizes the need for a messenger with a camera ? much like Blackberry have their Pearl handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera viewfinder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum available resolution is 1600 x 1200 pixels. The camera doesn?t have any complex settings, which is understandable ? E61i is not a dedicated cameraphone. The available settings include: night mode, sequence, self-release, white balance, and color effects. Pictures are stored in JPEG format and carry EXIF information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Image settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video is concerned, there are a few innovations worth mentioning. The maximum video resolution is 352 x 288 pixels (CIF) and the videos get recorded at 15 fps in the MPEG-4 video format.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity, Nokia E61i has pretty much got it covered on all sides. You name it: GPRS, EDGE, Wi-Fi, UMTS, USB, Bluetooth and Infrared. Nokia E61i works with Bluetooth Specification 1.2 and A2DP is not among the supported profiles which makes impossible the use of stereo Bluetooth headset with the phone. But then again, E61i is a business oriented smartphone right form the get go. The supported Bluetooth profiles are Dial-Up Networking, File Transfer Service and Object Push Service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is supported with the USB cable supplied in the retail box. When connected to a PC, one of three modes can be chosen for the handset: ?Mass storage? - memory card is available as a removable USB drive, no drivers are required; "PC Suite" - standard mode; "Picture Bridge" - direct access to printer, which supports PictBridge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fast data transfers can be achieved via GPRS, EDGE or 3G UMTS. You can also try the Wi-Fi connectivity, in which case you have to be near a Wi-Fi hotspot. And while you are at it, feel free to use the available Internet telephony.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E61i has the latest support for SIP-based services. You can set Internet calling (VoIP) as the default calling method when a SIP service is available which makes internet calls that much easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This E61i comes with a built-in WLAN scanner ? something we?ve missed in previous Nokia WLAN-enabled smartphones. Now such an application along with an Active standby screen plug-in is available as an official download for all previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> WLAN Scanner</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing at its fullest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing with Nokia E61i is a sheer delight as is the case with all current Nokia smartphones. The web browser makes even very sophisticated pages fit on the screen and displays web pages just as on PC. There is no doubt that the great display helps a lot for this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is even a mouse cursor which can be operated through the four-way navigation button. Surprisingly, it works great and is very easy to control. A semi-transparent mini-map of the page shows up on the screen when scrolling a webpage. The mini-map can also be accessed by a shortcut ? the ?8? key. You can zoom in and out on the page using the ??? and ?#? buttons. Of course on E61i all those shortcuts are available by using the blue function key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Partial and full mini-map</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the sites we visited (including gsmarena.com, take a look at the screenshots) looked exactly like on the PC. Even when loading complex pages, the web browser was operating fast and there was no slowdown in the scrolling speed. The browser also loads Flash clips (not all of them, pitifully) and has no problems dealing with Java Scripts. All-in-all, it?s an impressive job from Nokia. Generally, this browser remains the best mobile browser we?ve seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zoom out ? normal view ? zoom in</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian web browser is unable to open simple WAP pages so for that purpose the Nokia E61i is equipped with the much simpler WAP browser called Services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plan and act<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has various organizer applications and features. The Calendar has Monthly, Weekly and Daily view. You can assign Meeting, Anniversary, Memo and To-do tasks in the Calendar. You can also put alarms on those assignments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calendar: monthly, weekly, and daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to applications, the E61i surely has a lot of them. There is the Quickoffice, the Notes application, the Converter, the Calculator, Recorder, the PDF viewer, the ZIP manager, and the Printers applications. The Converter converts Currencies, Area, Energy, Length, Mass, Power, Pressure, Temperature, Time, Velocity and Volume. The calculator is very simple and easy to use. Regrettably, the Recorder has a one minute limit for voice records. This seems quite illogical since the phone has such powerful features, enough internal memory and a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Converter ? Calculator ? Recorder ? Sample note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quickoffice opens and edits various office files such as ones created by MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint. They can be viewed seamlessly. Zooming, Scrolling, Resizing are supported as well. The PDF viewer works quicker than most other similar application we?ve seen around. There is also a Data Transfer application in the Tools submenu. It is used to transfer contacts and organizer items from one Nokia phone to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Word file ? Excel file ? PDF file</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the phone has an excellent Tutorial tool which describes in a very user-friendly way the main functions of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Available tutorials ? ?Navigation? help file </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E61i also has Online sharing support. Using it you can share your images and videos in online albums, weblogs, or in other sharing services on the Web. You can upload content, save unfinished posts as drafts and continue later, and view the content of the albums. In order to connect your mobile directly to a service provider such as Flickr you must download a configuration file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E61i doesn?t have any games preinstalled as it is ?business all over? but if you are into it, there would be no problem in installing games of your own. Currently there are plenty of games for the latest version of Symbian S60 for you to download and enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, it?s time for us to call it a day and finish the E61i review. There isn?t much to say really ? you wanted a messenger handset with a camera and you got it. And it is a really good one. You may remember the couple of questions we laid out when we set to do this review. It?s probably took you several pages until you got here, so let us refresh your memory on those:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, as our opinion goes, the camera doesn?t really throw the E61i into a different market niche ? it can surely earn it some new rivals, but in the end, it remains the second attempt of Nokia at the messenger form factor. It?s always been an increasingly competitive market and Nokia have done their best to make it tougher for the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So getting back to that itching question of all you E61 owners ? should I swap mine of E61i or not, we guess that you?ve already found your answer when you bought your Nokia messenger without a camera. The E61i surely offers some really nice upgrades over E61, but considering the probable cost of dumping your used E61 and getting the E61i really doesn?t makes sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our thanks go to Mobile Gadgets for providing us with the test E61i unit.</paragraph>
