			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Flick it, kick it, throw it, wet it. Drag and drop it. And watch it come back for more. The Sony Ericsson Xperia active is a survivor. The rugged smartphone has a Bravia Reality display and exchangeable covers, 1GHz of oomph and HD video, and plenty of sporty apps. It's got you - tucked under an arm strap. It goes wherever you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Durable smartphones are becoming an Android-exclusive niche and Sony Ericsson want in. But the Xperia active believes that an IP67-certified phone doesn't have to be all muscle and no charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active is a cute little phone - the action-scene body double of the Xperia mini. Go ahead, laugh it up, Sonim. This is a phone that doesn't take much pocket space, which is a big plus in our book. And no, they don?t have to be cargo pockets either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IP67-certified Xperia active is supposed to withstand water immersion in up to a meter for as long as half an hour. It's also dust-proof and shock-resistant. Before you ask, we're not going to test it to the very limit of endurance. Like we said, some real heavy duty rugged phones can sneer all they want. It's just that a compact sporty smartphone for both urban and wilderness hikes may as well have the last laugh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active has the specs and looks of an Xperia mini. What you get is a full-featured smartphone with some high-end ingredients like the Reality Display, Snapdragon processor and HD video. It's a phone for an active lifestyle - it's got the proper build and the right set of apps. Sony Ericsson did not skimp on the in-box accessories either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active doesn't quite look the typical rugged phone, no ribbed hardened rubber case. It's definitely sporty though and the compact size more than makes sense for a handset you?re likely to take on jogs or bike rides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Sony Ericsson planning to focus exclusively on smartphones, they know they need to add more variety to their lineup. That includes distinctly niche phones like the Xperia active. Keeping an eye on the competition is a good thing too. The Xperia active seems to fit comfortably between a Samsung Galaxy S5690 Xcover and a Motorola Defy+. And being the smallest of the bunch isn't necessarily a bad thing. They don't call it survival of the biggest, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Xperia active is the kind that thrives on action. Let's get busy then and see what the rugged droid is really made of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Xperia active is a real treat. To get the usual ingredients out of the way, a charger with detachable USB cable is supplied, along with a set of black in-ear headphones. A complimentary 2GB MicroSD card is inside the phone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active has exchangeable rear covers and our black unit came with an extra white cover in the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rubber wrist strap and an arm case are also provided, as well as headset ear hooks. You've got everything you need to listen to music or monitor your progress while jogging or exercising.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Xperia active is a natural swimmer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were itching to test the Xperia active's water resistance ever since it first stepped in our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the water test is the most fun to do and we wanted to check out the wet finger tracking Sony Ericsson is bragging about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot the whole thing on video, so you can enjoy it too:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active did a fantastic job of staying alive during the test. There was no water penetrating inside and it retained full functionality throughout. The wet finger tracking, as you can see in the video, works like a charm. The display had no problems recognizing finger commands even when very wet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only dent in the Xperia active's underwater armor are the three capacitive buttons below the display. Once those hit the water surface they recognized it as a command and would either go to the homescreen, go back to the previous screen or open up the menu screen. But this isn't so bad, considering that most smartphones would go haywire in such a scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't test the drop resistance of the Xperia active because we didn't want to scar that pretty face. But it does seem capable of withstanding a 1m drop. We've seen non-rugged phones survive that. We don't mean to take away from the Xperia active fame here. We are duly impressed by its underwater performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia active 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active is a small phone. At 92 x 55 x 16.5 mm it certainly is a little chunky, but in the same nice way the Xperia mini is. And 110.8 g it isn't a burden either. We'd call it solid rather than heavy. As a reference, the Xperia mini weighs 99 g. The splash and dust resistance have made the active a bit heavier. It?s mostly the dual back cover perhaps that accounts for the added weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's no hassle to slip in a pocket and is very confortable to hold. The rubbery rear is nice to the touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's a phone that catches the eye. The prominent "bottle opener" accent at the bottom breaks the straight lines and heightens the sporty feel of the handset. Running around the entire front is a brushed metal frame, doubled by an orange-colored strip of plastic that separates it from the battery cover. The orange accent looks great on the black case - less so with the spare white cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active has the same Reality display used in the mini, a LED-backlit LCD unit enhanced by Sony?s Bravia Mobile Engine. It's a 3" HVGA touchscreen with pixel density of 192 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of screen brightness and colors we're very pleased with this handset. On such a small screen HVGA is more than adequate - the picture is quite crisp, with good contrast. The excellent sunlight legibility is a major point in favor. Of great importance too in a device that will be much used outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature of the Xperia active's display is that it can respond to even wet fingers. So whether it's the rain or your hands are sweaty from exercise, the screen is supposed to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you'll find a proximity sensor that disables the touchscreen during calls, and an ambient light detector. There's the usual status LED too. Unlike the Live with Walkman, the Xperia active hasn't got a secondary camera to use in video chats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is where you'll find the primary microphone and three capacitive buttons: Back, Home and menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the phone you'll find the volume rocker and shutter key. The volume keys are quite prominent and easy to locate by touch. The shutter key is very soft with deep half press for auto-focus. Both controls are set within the strip of orange plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock button is alone on the left side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unusually, there's nothing at the top of the phone. The connectivity ports are both at the bottom, where it must've been easier to secure the case against water and dust. Hidden under air-tight plastic lids are the 3.5mm headphone jack and the USB port. This isn't the most comfortable solution but one dictated by the level of proofing sought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 MP camera lens and single LED flash are placed at the back of the device, alongside the loudspeaker and the secondary microphone pinhole for active noise cancellation during calls. The rubbery finish of the rear is nice to touch and fingerprint proof. Although it seems fairly resistant to scratches, there's nothing to suggest exceptional ruggedness. No grip enhancing cuts, no ribbed hard rubber frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's when you remove the battery cover though that the dust and water proofing claims become quite credible. Underneath is an extra layer of protection in the shape of a hard plastic lid that seals off the battery and the internals. Effectively, the Xperia active has two battery covers and the inside one is lined with rubber to fit tightly on the chassis and keep all sorts of fluids and dirt away from the sensitive parts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the two lines of defense you'll find the MicroSD card slot, the SIM card compartment and the 1200 mAh battery. Believe it or not, the card slot is actually hot-swappable. It's arguable though whether you can still call it hot-swap when you have to get two covers out of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson claim the Xperia active should last up to 351h/335h in 2G and 3G on stand-by, while talk time should be 4:53h/5:31h, with about 25h of music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality our unit had to be charged daily when pushed. We'd say it did worse than the Xperia mini and the Live with Walkman that we recently tested. It was the usual workload of browsing, imaging tests and benchmarks with the phone constantly connected to both wireless and 3G. Maybe the test handset we were given had been used before or had a faulty battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the Xperia active. The fact that we liked the Xperia mini too is a big part of it. We do think it was the right choice of phone to remodel as an off-roader. Some people will tell you there can't be a real rugged touchscreen phone. There may be a point in that. But they will probably have fewer reasons to doubt a 3" screen than a 3.7-incher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes sense we think for a durable, sporty phone to be compact. And the 3" screen of the Xperia active is proven to work. Not too comfortable for typing but otherwise perfectly OK. It's a Reality display too, with image quality that puts presumably superior smartphones to shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a nutshell, the Xperia active can be the rugged smartphone to give the best of both worlds. We're about to move on to the smartphone side of it but not before we check if the proofing claims hold water.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: more than one widget per screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread, with a custom skin and a nice package of apps. The corner-based homescreen of the Xperia minis makes a comeback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get five homescreen panes to fill with widgets, shortcuts or folders, and the corner drawers are visible on all screens. With a minor exception: if a widget is too big (the People widget for example) it hides the top two corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite like Sony Ericsson's Overview mode on the homescreen. You pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new pane sets in with a cool transition effect to display all of your active widgets. If there is not enough space for all the widgets, they start floating on the screen overlapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Overview mode is similar to HTC?s Leap view or what Samsung have in TouchWiz. However, widgets are not ordered in mini screens, so small that you cannot actually see what?s on each of them. Widgets are shuffled together instead so they can better use the space. They are as big as possible and thus easier to tap on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four corners can host up to four shortcuts each, as easy to assign as a simple drag-and-drop. If a corner has a single shortcut (just the dialer for example), the respective app launches automatically upon a tap. If there is more than one shortcut - the tab expands into a jog wheel so you can make your choice properly. You can't put folders there though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu, you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort the icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini supports both static and live wallpapers. There are 15 static wallpapers and a single live one (Maps), but you can always get more at the Market or use a picture from your personal gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini has themes enabled too but the implementation is pretty basic: a theme only changes the wallpaper and the system menus. On a positive note, if you like Sony Ericsson's wave theme but you are tired of watching it in blue, now you can have it in a lot more colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're very pleased with the interface response. It's zippy throughout, probably due to the lower screen resolution (HVGA instead of WVGA or higher). And the UI is well optimized for the smallish screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. You can easily filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you not only see the latest activities and updates of your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or return a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set it as a homescreen widget too. There are free Timescape plugins on the Android Market for Sony Ericsson users. Currently, you can update your Timescape with mixi, Foursquare, Orkut, Gmail, Music and Photo extensions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active comes with a 1GHz MSM8255 Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM. That?s enough power to smoothly handle loads of apps. Gingerbread helps in this department too and HVGA resolution means the GPU has much less pixels to process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual set of benchmarks on the Xperia active. Here are the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Quadrant it got the respectable 1730 points, which is well over some of last year?s top droids. On Neocore it went up to 66.2 frames per second, which is a good achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AnTuTu pits the Sony Ericsson Xperia active against the best in class and the score of nearly 3113 points beats the likes of the Nexus S and Desire HD. Smartbench 2011 was the only mediocre score for the Xperia active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers aside, the Xperia active doesn?t disappoint in terms of actual performance. It?s a very fluid and responsive smartphone and you?ll hardly find anything to complain about. The fact that in-browser Flash playback goes up to 720p trouble-free is evidence of the kind of performance to expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active's visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. The list can be sorted by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If someone is added in more than one account, you can ?join? their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality is good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments. We didn?t experience any reception issues either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia active does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia active automatically disables the touchscreen during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test. Sony Ericsson have the xLOUD audio enhancement on the Xperia active. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter - xLOUD made a difference of about 5dB when you sum up the tests. It's not just a straightforward increase though - it boosts lower frequencies, while high frequencies (and high frequency ringtones) remain mostly untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active got an Average mark with xLOUD on and Below Average with xLOUD off. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Android values simplicity in design and is very easy to use. All SMS/MMS are organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick Contacts feature only works in separate messages, not in the whole thread. You can also request delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only to three lines, which makes working with longer texts harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface since Gingerbread - it's done by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - three virtual keyboards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia active offers just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard (portrait and landscape) and a virtual numeric pad in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have added support for Facebook albums too. They are set apart by a small Facebook logo and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player: limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia active as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia active did play a 720p MP4 video though (it records 720p videos, so it's expected to). The 3? HVGA Reality screen isn't what you'd call movie-watching material but it gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman-style music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia active is quite the looker. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums. Altough it is an Xperia device you'll find no differences with the Walkman line of products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get send and delete options. There is also a dedicated search bar at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, the current album and the Infinite key, which allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets. One or two custom slots would?ve made sense ? after all the player needs something to justify its Walkman badge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xLOUD audio enhancement is a setting that ups the loudspeaker volume. It?s not exclusive to the Xperia active ? all of the Xperia smartphones have it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nicely clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active did pretty well in our traditional audio output test. The first part of it anyway, as we couldn't connect the Y-adapter we needed for the second part, due to the specific design of the 3.5mm jack. Anyway, we are pretty sure it share the audio bits with its Live with Walkman cousin, so you can check the score of that one for performance under load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>with the smartphone connected to an active external amplifier, the Xperia active had nothing but excellent scores to show us. Its frequency response was spot on, the distortions were kept well under control and there was practically no stereo crosstalk. There's certainly nothing to be unhappy about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial to make skipping to the next station easier. Or, you can mark some of the saved stations as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service for song recognition is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is acceptable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active offers a 5 megapixel snapper with a single LED flash. There is a handy dedicated shutter key too just like on the Live with Walkman and the Xperia mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Xperia active's camera is quite intuitive. You have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features on the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder switch at the bottom. You can hide or expand both bars with swiping gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most used shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to enable/disable touch capture and turn on flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key (or dragging the left bar to the right side) you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, touch capture, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. The Xperia active also boasts face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is okay on the Xperia active. The produces photos have good color reproduction but the amount of captured detail isn't impressive. Detail gets smeared the further away from the center of the picture you look - just like on the Live with Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a panorama option too, like on other models from this year. But the actual sample we made doesn't deserve an audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise is very low but due to the aggressive noise reduction algorithm much of the detail is lost. We also took a couple of close-ups with the Xperia active. The result isn't too impressive as you can tell for yourselves in the photos below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia active to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active does okay against competition such as the Wildfire S and Motorola DEFY but faced with true cameraphone competition in the 5 MP class, like the iPhone 4 or the Samsung Galaxy Ace it fails badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson Xperia active in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording not impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HD video recording is getting to be something of a must in recent smartphones and the Xperia active enters a league full of competitors. It?s framerate circles around the 30fps and is quite steady too. As some previous Sony Ericsson devices, the active also captures a few duplicated frames, but not that much to ruin the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active camcorder supports continuous autofocus. Its approach is the same as on the Xperia X10, Arc, Neo, etc: it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe instead of fast and constant re-focusing. It?s certainly the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the video quality is on par with the Live with Walkman. The videos run smooth, but the captured detail is low and there's a pinkish spot in the center. On the positive side, the color rendering is spot on. The HD samples look good on the small display, but they are not that great on a bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with the 720p video samples captured by the Live with Walkman and the Xperia mini we are happy only with the smoothness. We guess that the camera sensor is identical in the three models as they all suffer from the same shortcomings - both in stills and video recording. On the Xperia active detail is very low and the elements in the video look soft focused and not sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the  untouched 720p sample that we captured with the Xperia active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We added the Xperia active samples to our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with the other 720p mobile camcorders we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of fine detail is evident when compared to competing products plus there's a pinkish spot in the center of the frame. Comparison with the Live with Walkman further suggests the same sensor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active has quad-band (850/900/1800/1900) GSM network support. There?s dual-band 900/2100 and tri-band 850/1900/2100 3G too, depending on region. You can count on up to 7.2 Mbps of download speed. Wi-Fi covers the b/g/n standards and there is Wi-Fi hotspot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and standard microUSB are also on the list. Like all recent Xperia smartphones, the Xperia active supports USB on the go via a LiveDock, which is sold separately.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the Adobe Flash 10.3 support, the Xperia active?s web browser does a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty light at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in or pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap ? a moment after setting the zoom level just double tap on the display and the columns of text will align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2? HVGA screen may sound too small, but it is more than enough and you have all the screen estate for actual content. The Xperia mini's browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser has full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.3 player (available for free at the Market). YouTube videos at 360p played quite smoothly but you'll have no problems with 720p too, once the video has loaded. Playing Kongregate Flash games is no problem on the Sony Ericsson Xperia active too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active has a GPS receiver and A-GPS support. It managed to lock onto satellite signal in less than 2 minutes with A-GPS turned off. With A-GPS on, which involves some network data, satellite lock took less than a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is in charge of the digital maps department on the phone. In many countries it even comes with free turn-by-turn navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Street View, allowing 360-degree view of any area you might be interested in (providing the regular GMaps has Street View coverage there, of course). In Street view you can pinch zoom in and you can enable the compass for automatic panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the Xperia active with Maps 5 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on your region you may get the Xperia active with Wisepilot navigation pre-installed, but you'll have to pay for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Xperia active is for the sports-minded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson declared a healthy proactive approach toward its smartphone devices back in February by adding ANT+ support. ANT+ is a wireless signal technology, which has been integrated into numerous fitness and health-monitoring devices, allowing them to transmit their data wirelessly to any ANT+ enabled display or logging device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Imagine that you were out there on the track and your smartphone was ANT+ capable, measuring and recording all your vital statistics and performance indicators.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not for running only. All fitness, sport and health-tracking products such as heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors, spin bikes, foot pats, weight scales, and so on, can send your health data and statistics to an ANT+ enabled mobile device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The technology relies on a 2.4 Ghz wireless network protocol and could be simultaneously connected to multiple devices. Connection and pairing between devices is a matter of push of a button or just holding the devices near one another for a couple of seconds. Now that?s seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't an ANT+-enabled accessory in the retail box of the Xperia active so you will have to buy one (if you don't already own one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have also preinstalled the WalkMate and iMapMyFITNESS+ apps on the Xperia active. WalkMate is a very simple application, which relies on the built-in accelerometer sensor to count how many footsteps you take in a day. iMapMyFITNESS+ tracks your training via GPS and then sends the distance, route and other information to your free account on mapmyfitness.com where you can check it out later. It's a free app and available for other OSes too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active comes with a solid set of organizer apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes application as well as Reminders. Document viewing is enabled, courtesy of the OfficeSuite. Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF are supported, including the Office 2007 versions. Editing will cost you around $10 at the Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects are there too: an Alarm clock, calculator, calendar - all basically unchanged from previous Sony Ericsson droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app has desk clock and night mode enabled. It dims the display so that it won't bother you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is a music recognition service that was pioneered by Sony Ericsson on their Walkman feature phones. Open the app, record some of the music you?re listening to and hope that the Gracenote servers will find the song in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app for Android is preinstalled and has all the functionality you need: photo uploads, comments, news feeds, groups and events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chances are, though, you won?t use it all that much given the deep Facebook integration on the phone. Your Facebook contacts are in the phonebook while Albums are in the gallery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The new Android Market looks great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia active has the latest version of the Android Market, featuring a facelift with a bit of WP7 styling. New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor?s Choice and a dedicated Sony Ericsson tab, courtesy of the maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you?re greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free, Trending (the ones with growing popularity) and Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson pane is the place to get the company optimized apps. It?s something along the lines of the HTC Likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn?t quite like about the new Android Market layout is that you?ll be forced to do a lot of scrolling if you want to go to a specific category and there isn?t a listed or tabbed menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's own store called PlayNow is also on board. There you can get a lot of free things for your phone - wallpapers, some games and apps or even music tracks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, this is an Xperia mini in a wetsuit. Some people will be less than impressed. One hand on the remote the other deep in that bag of chips. The kind that just can?t be bothered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia active on the other hand doesn?t want to be on the safe side. It won?t take rain checks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rugged droid is at the end of our training range ? sweating but not gasping. Hardly a surprise ? we knew all along there was a solid smartphone inside the durable shell. The Xperia active delivers the complete Android experience. A neat little phone that does things almost as well as an Xperia arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a well built phone too with a distinct outdoor styling. The first dust proof and water resistant droid by Sony Ericsson is well protected against the elements. The one thing to warn against is the less than stellar battery life. You know, it?s a phone that can take a lot of abuse but not the right kind of gadget to spend days out in the wilderness with. However, if a rugged smartphone is a must, the Xperia active fits the urban survivor bill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you?re on the market for a durable smartphone, it?s Android or nothing. The niche doesn?t seem all that crowded but it?s not free of competition either. A big (literally) rival of the Xperia active is the Motorola DEFY+, which builds on the original DEFY and adds, among other things, actual IP67 certification. It?s got a bigger and higher res display and a better battery to match. We?re yet to see though whether a 1700 mAh Li-Po unit that needs to power a WVGA 3.7-incher will make that much of a difference. Otherwise the rest of the specs pretty much on par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola DEFY+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover is another full-size rugged droid but obviously not as sophisticated as the Xperia active. With the right price tag though, it could be quite an attractive deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Xcover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think the compact size is quite an advantage for the Xperia active. If nothing else, it sets the phone apart from the competition. And the whole package is built on a concept that?s proven to work. In the entire Xperia lineup, the mini is the right one to have a rugged version of. Compromises are inevitable in the ultra-compact class. Screen size is among the few the Xperia active makes. This rugged droid is genuinely trying not to take too much space. And it doesn?t mind living on the edge.</paragraph>
