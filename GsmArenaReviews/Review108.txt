			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There never seems a shortage of heroes in this industry but every now and then a new breed emerges to change the rules of engagement. Ranks and titles are hard earned and we've seen enough contenders that barely deserve a hero's death. Now, here comes a gadget that knows the best shot at glory is the high-definition one. Will the Samsung Omnia HD be strong enough to bear its name with honor or will it crumble under the weight of expectations?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As all-in-one multimedia touchscreens are battling for dominance, the HD category is now making its way to cellphones. HD is a magical marketing word that has seen as many abuses as it has had just uses. In the Omnia HD case, it's an insignia of its truly superior rank. It's not the first time a handset has claimed this tempting acronym, but the Omnia HD hits it where it matters - video recording and playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung were the first to announce and release an HD-video-enabled handset. In the not so short time since then, none of their major rivals managed to introduce a competitor. So, all heads are anxiously turned to Samsung to see if they can deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Omnia HD comes equipped with everything that Samsung can put on the table. HD video recording and playback is definitely top-notch stuff but these are just the fancy extras on a full battle suit. There's also a huge AMOLED screen, powerful 600 MHz processor and dedicated graphics chip. The all-in-one count continues with an 8 megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, generous 8/16 GB internal storage and DivX/XviD HD playback with subtitle support. Finally, the whole thing runs the latest Symbian S60 5th edition skinned with the new TouchWiz 3D interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the time to check out this genuine all-rounder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the Omnia HD is packed with all kinds of goodies, but not without a few setbacks on the way to retail. If the whole thing is put together right though, the i8910 Omnia HD may have every reason to claim its rightful place on the throne as the unchallenged king of HD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of you must be wondering what took us so long to get an Omnia HD for a proper in-depth review as it's been around for a while. Well, it's true and it's not. Samsung i8910 Omnia HD was released in the end of May through selected carriers but shortly after that Samsung froze production and stopped supplies, reportedly due to software problems. Now, the official release has been announced and the Omnia HD is available worldwide, all bugs fixed?though let us be the judge of that. But anyway, the i8910 Omnia HD is ready to roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is our third and last meeting with the handset and we're still excited about exploring an industry leading device. The verdict of course is a few pages away, but a device that ticks off the wishlist of high-end features and marries Symbian and TouchWiz is certainly worth a closer look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hope you're as keen to join as the Omnia HD is eager to shoot those high-res videos. But first things first, let's take a look at the design and handling after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Omnia HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is a high-end multimedia handset, but comes with an fairly standard package. There is the mandatory charger, microUSB cable and a 3.5mm headset. The headset microphone is quite close to the left headphone (like the Apple iPhone headset), but a separate remote (and quite a big one) is found in the middle of the cable. Unfortunately, you cannot control music playback with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only extra thing you get with the Omnia HD is a TV cable, the same 3.5mm one which comes with the Nokia N-series. That said, it's probably the first time e see a TV-out cable in a Samsung retail package, but hey, we usually deal with prototypes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TV-out cable supplied cannot transfer HD content it's really a regular RCA cable that's probably at the bottom end when it comes to transferring digital media, but is quite compact and you can hook up to every TV set out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i8910 Omnia HD 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is hardly the most compact phone around. In fact the first impression it leaves is of an abnormally wide handset with its 123 x 59 mm. At 12.9mm thickness, it can almost be called slim but it's by no means light. If that's the price to pay for this kind of functionality, we guess most people would be willing to make the compromise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designing a fully touch-operated mobile phone certainly doesn't leave too much freedom in the aesthetics department and all of them look more or less identical. The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD doesn't depart from the standard looks, the metallic frame around the display obviously an attempt to give it a face of its own, but the glossy plastic around the display looks rather cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front panel is taken up by Omnia HD's key feature - the 3.7" 16M-color AMOLED touchscreen enclosed in a glossy metallic frame. The handset uses the capacitive touchscreen technology as opposed to the resistive screen of the first S60 5th edition handset, the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. The screen is quite sensitive and we're quite pleased with it in that respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive technology used guarantees the excellent responsiveness of the screen at the expense of only being able to use your fingers - no stylus, no plectrum, no anything? Still, there are some capacitive screen styluses ot there that are said to do the job, but we haven't tried them ourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung i8910 offers amazing picture quality. The resolution of 360 x 640 pixels (the same as the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and Nokia N97) is not exactly top-of-the-line but the AMOLED technology does make a difference. The contrast and colors are really impressive and they give a real sharpness to images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news about the display of Samsung i8910 is that its legibility drops dramatically under direct sunlight. The Omnia HD screen is better by the recent crop of Samsung phones, but still remains inferior to the Apple iPhone displays, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD display offers haptic feedback, which makes the touchscreen a passable replacement for a hardware keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other noteworthy elements at the face of the Samsung i8910 are the video-call camera and the proximity sensor at the top, plus the three hardware keys at the bottom. The proximity sensor is used for locking the display during calls to avoid accidental presses when holding the phone next to your cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD has hardware Call and End keys plus a menu key, much like the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. They are made of plastic (just like the silvery frame around the display). The End key doubles as a power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side we find the volume rocker, which is adequately sized and quite easy to work with. Next to it is the microSD card slot, which is hot-swap enabled. But of course you'll hardly need it because of the 8/16 GB inbuilt storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Omnia HD is said to support microSD cards of up to 16GB, and this was as far as went testing it. The handset handled a full 16GB microSD card problem-free. We were pleased with the reading/writing speed and the initialization of the full microSD card was very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Samsung i8910 hosts the Hold key (to lock/unlock the touchscreen), the camera key and the microUSB port. It's a welcome benefit that the phone charges off the microUSB port so you can transfer data and charge your battery simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Samsung i8910 we find a loudspeaker and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. Much like the USB port, the audio jack is hidden under a small lid to keep dust away. The first loudspeaker occupies the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second loudspeaker is located at the bottom (dead center, again), along with the mouthpiece. This layout seems a respectful nod to the Omnia HD's exceptional video skill, around which everything seems to revolve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD's rear is all glossy plastic, turning it into a fingerprint nightmare. The battery cover fits firmly into place and there is no creaking when trying to open it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Samsung logo, the back side of the Omnia HD also hosts the 8 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. With video recording so high on the agenda, it's quite understandable why they went for LED rather than xenon technology. Still the Samsung Pixon12 offers both to cater for stills and video alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the sun will shine even on the rear of the Omnia HD and in our case it's the great 1500 mAh battery found under a cheapo plastic battery cover. Given the AMOLED screen with its low power consumption, the Omnia HD should count on above average battery life. After all, that's crucial for a multimedia device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD now is lower than expected. The huge AMOLED display is true high end stuff but the plastic bits (especially the battery cover) are below par. The hardware and design changes are a mixed bag really but we guess the multimedia performance will make up for it big time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we should again point out that the huge screen real estate calls for some extraordinary body dimensions as well. The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is easily among the largest handsets on the market, even though it's reasonably slim. Comfortable single-handed operation will definitely be an issue for some users - so a try-before-you-buy is advisable.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz'd Symbian OS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The i8910 Omnia HD is Samsung's first Symbian S60 5th edition-powered touchscreen device. However if you expect its software to be an exact copy of either the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic or the N97 you are going to be very surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first sight you might not even recognize the Symbian OS under the cheerful TouchWiz UI that's running on top of it. The customization only stretches to the homescreen and the menu icons but that's almost enough to give the i8910 Omnia HD the user friendliness of a typical Samsung feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen layout is the TouchWiz one, where you get to fill your homescreen with as many widgets as you like. Those are small programs, shortcuts or just reminders that give you quick access to some of the features of the handset or provide some specific info. Widgets are getting more and more popular and the reason is quite understandable - some of the most frequently used features and services are just a tap away on the homescreen. You can hide those widgets you use least (or don't use at all), as well as download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, you can arrange three completely different homescreens full of widgets. Switching between them is handled by the three small shortcuts at the top right corner, which become active one you slide out the widgets bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you aren't a great fan of the TouchWiz widgetry there are two more options for the homescreen layout (found under homescreen themes in the menu) - Finger use and Basic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finger use is identical to the one found on the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. It offers a set of four large and easily thumbable shortcuts that lead to selected applications. The basic theme on the other hand leaves your homescreen completely empty with only the four standard buttons displayed at the bottom - Telephone, Contacts, Messaging and Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD also features a nice transition effect between the homescreen, the main menu and the photo contacts app. Those three interchange upon a finger sweep with a transition effect resembling the inner walls of a cube. If you don't care for transition effects, and you are looking for a bit of extra speed, you can switch that off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A sweep to the right will take you to the Photo Contacts feature, which is quite neat. It allows you to assign a whole image, or even a cropped part of it, to entries in the phonebook. Sweeping a finger to the left of the widgets screen, opens up the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the colorful outfit of the Omnia HD lays the Symbian S60 5th Edition. Quickly maturing it might be, but it is still far from perfect. We have already discussed the inconsistency it has with scrolling (which goes in the way of your finger through a scrollbar in the menus and in the exact opposite direction with some applications).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's similar unpredictability when selecting items too. You would normally need a single tap in grid menus and two taps in list menus. While we admit that you might eventually get used to all this, we definitely find those to be major problems with the usability of the S60 5th edition. That randomness causes quite a lot of confusion and is nowhere near the fluent and intuitive interface that the market currently demands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most menus of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD can be displayed as either a grid or a list. The menu organization is pretty intuitive and logical, most items located exactly where you would expect them to be. The two virtual soft keys ensure making your way around won't be any different than on a regular S60 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer automatically rotates the display of the Omnia HD but it doesn't work through the menus. Auto-rotation is fairly smooth with a decent fade out effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there is some lag at times (most notably in the gallery - more on that later) the overall performance of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is remarkable. The 600 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 CPU and the dedicated graphic chip do a fine job indeed powering that massive screen and the results are very pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD has 256MB of RAM - exactly twice as much as the Nokia N97. Now add the snappier CPU and you'll understand where the better overall performance comes from even with the added weight of the TouchWiz running on top of the Symbian OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical for Symbian, the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD comes with a phonebook that can store an unlimited number of entries, each holding as many fields as the users sees fit. You can assign a photo to each contact, or even a video if you wish. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo contacts a swipe away<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned the Omnia HD comes complete with the Photo contacts app, which is an interestingly looking alternative to the phonebook. While it still relies on the regular contact database, the Photo contacts application might save you the effort of ever entering the phonebook again once you've filled it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app itself allows you to tag parts of photos, which can then be used as shortcuts to various contacts. That might be pretty handy if you are into grouping your contacts. You can take a photo of your colleagues and another one of your buddies and than tag each face to its respective phonebook entry. Then you are one photo away from calling everyone in for a poker night at your place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo contacts might not be the most practical application, but it is certainly one of the funniest ways to dial a number.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: Smart dialing would have been nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Omnia HD. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there was no interference whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately voice dialing is not an option with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. Smart dialing is another thing missing and it is even more crucial. It is hardly a deal-breaker since with no keypad present you still need some extra clicks, but we find it quicker than reaching for the phonebook every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can silence an incoming call on the phone by simply flipping it over. By the way that works for snooze alarms too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically while close to your cheek. There are four on-screen buttons available on screen during calls - mute, hold, loudspeaker and end call. Form the options menu you can find more settings like lock screen and keys, switch to video call, new call and etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. The handset didn't perform too impressively but still scored a Very good mark meaning we haven't seen too many louder handsets. You might still want to keep a closer eye on it when you are in noisier environments, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is all fine, but for an email wizard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of the Omnia HD is practically identical to the one found on its Nokia touch contemporaries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8910 Omnia HD supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone. When composing an SMS, a counter is displayed of characters left from the limit of 160. An indicator in brackets shows the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you insert some multimedia content, or an email address is inserted as recipient, the counter is replaced by a data counter showing the size of your email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first difference that Samsung I8910 Omnia HD introduces is to omit the dedicated editor for instant recording of audio messages. We weren't big fans of it anyway so we aren't going to pretend that we miss it much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. Unfortunately the Omnia HD doesn't support the easy setup we found in the latest Nokia handsets so you need to input all your account settings manually. It's not that you configure this every day but it's nice when the manufacturers save you some work, especially when the work in question involves typing on a touchscreen. Surely this can't be too difficult a feature for Samsung to implement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Samsung I8910 Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments and signatures and it seems that Samsung have pretty much thought of everything. And with a screen resolution like this, reading emails is an absolute pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the right time to mention the input options on the Samsung I8910 Omnia HD. The handset offers a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad in both portrait and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the full landscape QWERTY is also onboard to solve all your problems. It has a four-row layout so you need to use the function key for accessing the numbers and symbols, but that's no biggie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung I8910 Omnia HD offers handwriting recognition, which did a rather decent job in recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve its performance by taking the handwriting training and showing the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nothing to complain about the file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager is yet another aspect where the pedigree counts big time. With the soft keys at the bottom you might almost forget that you are looking at a new device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian file management system has been top notch for quite a while now, and it's difficult to imagine what could be changed about it. The application can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to search for a specific file or directory is also available on the phone. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory, mass memory or memory card) and the Omnia HD will find it in no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual action galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like with the video player, there are two galleries to choose from as well. The first one is identical to that on the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. Touch friendly and functional as it may be, we somehow feel more eye-candy could have been offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll pictures by sweeping your finger across the screen when looking at a single photo. Opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer. Unless you have that feature disabled, all you need to do to switch modes is to flip the phone sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second gallery, dubbed the Media browser, is easy to use and works fine. A sweep of your finger scrolls images and videos. The not the t practical tilt-to-scroll feature is enabled here as well and there's no way of deactivating it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilt scrolling is fun, to begin with. But then after a while it gets annoying: you have to be careful and not to tilt the handset too much since the angle corresponds to scrolling speed and you might miss an image or two. Still, we'd probably choose this gallery over the Symbian one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have taken a very interesting approach with the gallery, which seems to boost the contrast and saturation of the photos when browsed fullscreen. That makes them look amazingly cool on the large AMOLED display. The problem is that those corrections are only applied for the time the image is loaded in its full on the phone screen and the phone applies them to every image as it appears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The constant application of those corrections causes a certain amount of lag, which has a rather negative impact on usability. On the other hand, this is the only way to get the best of both worlds - the photos look stunning on the display, while at the same time if you download them to a computer they retain more information, giving you more freedom for post-processing. We do know however that there will be many users disappointed that on the desktop computer their photos won't have the punch they have on the phone screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately we also noticed lag with the gallery thumb initialization every time we opened it. This becomes even more evident when a larger number of photos accumulate on the device. In fact in terms of pure speed and performance this is probably the worst part of the Omnia HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack, the Omnia HD music features are well complemented by the generous 8 to 16 GB of onboard memory and support for microSDHC cards to potentially double this amount.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the music player is based on the one we've seen in the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. The novelty here is the virtual 5.1 channel Dolby Surround, which should help improve the headphone listening experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DNSe 2.0 audio enhancement is also on board but does not work simultaneously with Dolby Surround.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing our journey into sound, the 3D visualizations are a nice addition to the music player and the album browser seems to take after Apple's Cover Flow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback in HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD features two video players - the well known Symbian-embedded Real player is pretty much rendered useless by the proprietary Samsung video player that supports DivX/XviD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Video player has a plain but intuitive interface and does a great job. It even supports subtitles which are automatically detected and loaded. You can then further set them up and even manually synchronize them with the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tilt the phone the video player automatically switches to/from landscape view. You can adjust the size of the video and how it should fit on the widescreen display if it happens to have a different aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great 3.7" display and the widely-spaced stereo speakers make the Samsung Omnia HD a serious competitor for your dedicated portable multimedia player. The excellent battery life will complement that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knowing you can make your own HD movies with the i8910 is likely to make people wonder how they can watch those on their HD TV sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung Omnia HD doesn't have a HDMI port of any kind. That leaves DLNA as the only way you can stream your HD videos on a TV or a PC screen straight from the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To use DLNA with your TV, you have to get yourself a Wi-Fi-enabled TV set with DLNA support or a set-top box that has the same properties and which can channel your wirelessly streamed videos over a cable connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If, however, you can put up with lower resolution videos, you can always use the TV-out port on the device itself that's intended for transferring SD (non-HD) content via the TV-out cable supplied in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you use the cable all HD content that you play on the phone gets scaled down - first off it goes down to the Omnia screen resolution and then that signal gets upscaled to the TV resolution. So you can guess scaling is nothing so impressive in terms of quality. But still, you can watch all your videos fullscreen and it handles superbly the screen auto rotation - the content on the TV screen always has the right landscape orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But getting back to the handset's video playing capabilities, we have to conclude that they are by far the best we have seen. Easy to upload videos (with no additional application required), a player with a huge number of formats supported, subtitle support and - most importantly - an amazing display make the Omnia HD an unmatched package for watching video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD video playback is a real treat as well though the screen resolution is almost quarter that of a 720p video. Nevertheless we tried playing both XviD and DivX 720p videos on the Omnia HD (AVI container) and they played just fine with no dropped frames whatsoever and they looked way better then the Omnia own video recordings. Unfortunately, the playback of the video container more commonly used for HD content - MKV - is not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back with one of our pre-release Omnia HD units, we managed to squeeze a good 5 h and 30 min of constant video playback with the screen set at maximum brightness. That's better than what most laptops offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we have a retail unit we are pleased to see that it performs even more impressively managing 5 hours and 50 minutes of continuous playback of standard definition XViD video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio - simple, easy to use and functional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD has a really neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel the Omnia HD will take care of auto-switching to the frequencies of your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also room for six shortcuts for your favorite stations on the radio app screen. The handset also supports radio broadcast recording and of course can be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day Samsung announced that Omnia HD will have a built-in FM transmitter and that created a lot of commotion among users. The feature was not present on our retail unit and it wasn't present on our pre-release samples as well though Samsung announced it at first. When we went to research that, it turned out that any mentioning of an FM transmitter has also gone missing from Samsung web sites as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD demonstrated passable audio output, getting commendable scores on several of the readings in our traditional audio quality test. We have certainly seen better performers but things aren't hopeless with the Samsung i8910 either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most notable problem with the Omnia HD audio quality is its shaky frequency response and cut-off bass frequencies. The intermodulation distortion is also slightly higher than average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the noise level, the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk readings are excellent. The total harmonic distortion extremely low value is also commendable achievement. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity all covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity and Samsung i8910 Omnia HD makes no exception. Perfectly prepared, it can handle kinds of data transfer that a user might want it to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both USB and Bluetooth are version 2.0 and the latter naturally also sports A2DP. Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. There is no shortcut key for the Wi-Fi manager, but it can be easily found in the Connectivity menu and connecting to a WLAN network is two taps away. DLNA is also present for sharing digital content to other devices or computers on the local network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides that all kinds of GSM-based network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with 7.2 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE connectivity makes the handset perfectly capable of global roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia HD has a microSD memory card slot, which can can take up to 16GB cards. The microUSB port is pretty much standard connectivity feature on all recent Samsung handsets, and the 3.5mm audio jack completes the list by also doubling as a TV-out port, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TV output works well, though not in HD of course. The cable is a regular RCA one and all HD content that you play on the phone gets scaled down - first off it goes down to the Omnia screen resolution and then that signal gets upscaled to the TV resolution. So you can guess scaling is nothing so impressive in terms of quality. But still, you can watch all your videos fullscreen and it handles superbly the screen auto rotation - the content on the TV screen always has the right landscape orientation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser has Flash video and all the works<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD web browser is a fully functional application that would have used somewhat more user-friendly interface. The Flash support is cool and so is the kinetic scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To zoom in and out of a page you drag a small slider in the top right corner. The actual zooming is a bit unresponsive and quite slower than we would have liked it to be. To avoid zooming this way at all is by double-tapping a specific part of the web page. Zooming that way is sometimes a hit and miss thing as the web browser fails to fit the text on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Page Overview option, which is a sort of a minimap of the webpage that facilitates navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the page rendering algorithm is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed from a desktop computer. The high resolution is also a welcome bonus here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the web browser has support for both Flash and Java, which means that you can enjoy flash videos straight from your browser without having to use the mobile versions of sites like YouTube or a dedicated client applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While certainly capable, the Symbian S60 5th edition web browser could certainly use a bit of fine tuning.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer good to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 organizer didn't obviously get too much effort beyond the actual touch optimization. Well, developers were right up to a point but, given the progress of most competitors, some new functionality would have been nice - like copy/paste of events in the calendar or a new calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit though that the calculator is much more comfortable to operate with fingers than with a D-pad, almost as if it was designed for such use from the very beginning. However it is one of the most basic we have seen, offering a very limited set of functions. Even the Nokia S40 calculator has more features than this one. Luckily, you can find third-party alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and to-do, which allows you to check up all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are the same four types of events available for setting up as on S60 3rd edition - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files seamlessly. A PDF viewer is preinstalled, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to download the paid upgrade to unlock that functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a nice unit converter, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. A World clock is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone, much like with the Nokia S60 5th edition handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to the useful smart search application, which can look for a specific bit of data through contacts, logs, images, videos, messages etc. You can choose a specific category that you want to search in or search all. This appication is an absolute must if you've got a lot of data stored on your phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fine-quality camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly the 8 megapixel camera is one of the key features of the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. It delivered promising results when we previewed it a couple of times even if it wasn't finely tuned yet so we expected it to be among the best we have seen now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash might be a disappointment to some but the reason is LED can also be used as a video light. And video is certainly what the phone is really about. We'll get to it in a little while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is comfortable enough to work with and the UI has been altered to provide better touch experience. It is very comfortable with the most frequently used shortcuts only a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The range of settings offered by the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is immense: from manual white balance and ISO to exposure compensation, saturation, sharpness and contrast. Various effects are also at hand as well as Face and Smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smile shutter is trying to make sure the person you are photographing is going to be smiling on the photo. You just press the shutter and the camera will automatically detect when your subject is smiling and take the shot. We tried it several times and it worked pretty well, although if there are several faces in the frame the camera doesn't wait for all of them to smile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blink detection is also available but it only alerts you that the person on the photo you just took has blinked. This one certainly is more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. It would have been more useful if the camera delayed taking the shot instead. In other words - it's better to help you avoid making a crappy photo than yelling at you for doing so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The geotagging of images is also enabled and this is certainly good news. The Samsung i8910 Omnia HD puts the built-in GPS receiver to use, recording the location of each photo in the EXIF.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the company's proprietary wide dynamic range (WDR) feature, which decreases contrast thus increasing the dynamic range of the camera. The results are usually photos with much more detail in the shadow areas than one would have gotten otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD produces is pretty much as good as we have seen on a mobile phone. The color rendering is spot-on, contrast and dynamic range are also great. Fine detail is also very good although if anything could be improved - that's exactly it. In comparison to the Sasmung i8510 INNOV8 one can notice that the INNOV9 delivers more detail in the center of the frame than the Omnia HD. The touchscreen handset however strikes back with better corner sharpness. That difference in the sharpness of the two is probably due to the differences in the lenses used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors of the photos, taken with the INNOV8, are more saturated than those of the Omnia HD. We did mention that when you browse the photos on the Omnia they are automatically boosted to look more appealing but when downloaded to a computer they retain their original "natural" looks and feel. This gives you more options for post processing but if you aren't into that the results might not look as good as the INNOV8 to you. We guess you can increase the saturation and contrast in camera to achieve similar results - the settings are all there for you to tweak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certainly the best part about the Omnia HD camera (and the INNOV8 but we have already discussed that) is there are no major flows of any kind. No traces of oversharpening, no lack of contrast and no excessive noise. Plus, getting the exposure right at all times makes sure most of the photos are keepers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared quite a large number of samples for you to enjoy and appreciate the fine quality of the images taken with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. For starters here's the brief shootout that we made between it and the INNOV8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there go some more photos from the 8 megapixel camera of the Samsung i8910.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since there aren't virtually no changes in the processing algorithm compared to the last pre-release sample that we previewed you can also check those out as a good reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we also give you a bunch of samples that demonstrate what one can achieve with the Samsung Omnia HD and some basic knowledge of image editing. Down-sampled to 1024 x 768 those photos are certainly impressive and can easily rival point-and-shoot camera results in similar conditions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD videos - a step away from perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already told you that the Omnia HD (as the name suggests) is mostly about video. 720p HD video recording appears for the first time on a GSM handset and the excitement is quite worth it. The promised frame rate is also pretty sweet at 24 fps. Now we are not saying that D1 is not good enough to be usable - it's just that 720p HD videos are about triple the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact video recording was probably one of the main reasons for Samsung to delay the start of the Omnia HD. The audio codec used in the first produced devices was of incredibly poor quality and it had to be fixed. Now with the final unit we are getting AAC audio, which is just as good as the users hoped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back in the day the first VGA videos on a mobile phone were a disaster - merely a fat spec rather than a usable feature. So, what's even more impressive about the Omnia HD is getting the stunning video resolution right the first try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, now that we have a retail unit, we're not as impressed with the video quality as we were when we previewed the pre-release version. The Samsung Omnia HD video recording is still miles ahead of the competition but the results in our preview were definitely better. Perhaps the improvement of the audio quality has resulted in lowering of the video quality as a compromise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video resolution is no longer stunning as it was and when you add the excessive camera shake, the impression that you're looking at something taken by a dedicated HD digital camcorder is all gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In almost all the cases the framerate was variable and went below the promised 24fps giving the videos somewhat choppy looks. We aren't talking disastrously many dropped frames but there are about one every second in some videos. You might not even notice that if shooting slower moving objects but more rapid movements looks bad. The Samsung Omnia HD is not really the soccer mom's dream.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia camcorder interface is identical to the one of the still camera and allows the user to choose between fixed and auto focus for the video. Effects are also available and a gridline can be applied to the viewfinder for easier framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough image stabilization isn't available when shooting video and that is precisely where we would have needed it the most. The camera shake is seriously plaguing most of our samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recording time is not exactly limited, the real limit is imposed on the maximum file size for each recording. In this case videos don't get any bigger than 2GB. With 720p recording that means 30-40 minutes of footage and we cannot see anyone needing much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are done recording a video clip, the Omnia HD displays the viewfinder but doesn't let you start another recording straight away. Instead you have to wait for a while, as the handset saves the video in its memory. Now this is to be expected with such large files but a status indicator would have been nice so you can tell when you are ready to start another recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the sample videos we captured with the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD. We have uploaded them to YouTube, so you can check them out straight from your browser. Even when recompressed they still look rather good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation and digital compass are on board as well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled navigation software on the Samsung Omnia HD can easily turn the handset in a fully functional SatNav system - especially thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver on board. It comes with the Samsung Mobile Navigator, which is based on the Route66 own mobile application. Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features, but the goodies come at an extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the voice guided navigation as well as the other services such as the weather service, traffic info and safety cameras info, travel guides didn't come with free license on our unit. We are guessing though that this will be strictly market dependent. Purchased separately, a one-year voice-guided navigation license for a given region costs about 70 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you are unhappy with Samsung Navigator for some reason you can go for some competing application. There are plenty third-party developers waiting to earn some cash by offering navigation software for Symbian S60 5th edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another seemingly cool feature that the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD has is the digital compass. After a relatively quick initialization, it displays a virtual compass on screen. Our disappointment is that it's far from being really precise even after we calibrated it according to the instructions. On the positive side its integration with the SatNav application is really improving the navigation experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming on HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only game that comes preinstalled on the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD is the Asphalt 4 racing simulator. It offers accelerometer based-controls where you tilt the phone for the car to turn, which are responsive enough to provide nice gaming experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And having in mind that this is a Symbian handset, you are by no means limited to that title only. There are plenty of games to download and as more and more S60 5th edition devices make their way to the narket, there will be even more games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When first revealed, the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD seemed almost too good to be true. Even the few bumps on its way to the mass market didn't spoil its appeal. The Omnia HD AMOLED display has neither the biggest screen estate, nor the highest resolution around but it still remains one of the top units in the touchscreen realm. And behind the welcoming gates, immense multimedia power awaits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certainly, imaging is the main focus and it can hardly be otherwise when video outdoes the market's second best by a whopping margin. We are pretty pleased with the camcorder output, especially now that the audio is on the level HD videos deserve. We still believe though the framerate has room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But probably the biggest compliment to the video recording is that it leaves a capable 8 megapixel still camera in its shadow, not to mention the other cool extras that simply fade into the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the Symbian-powered Omnia HD is one of the best equipped handsets we've ever had the chance to review. A brief look at the competition should help to see how far ahead it actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to pick one alternative to the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD, we would probably go for the Sony Ericsson Satio (previously known as Idou). It matches most of the features on the Omnia HD, but misses out on two of the most important ones - HD video recording (it's not that any other handset has that anyway) and the AMOLED screen. It does make up for those with a 12 megapixel shooter, but we still feel an extra-competitive price will be the only way for it to trade blows with the Samsung Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Satio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then of course comes Samsung's very own Pixon12. However, with no smartphone platform to back it up and much smaller display it's targeting a different audience really. More fun-to-use than a workhorse device, the Samsung Pixon12 is a welcome substitute for your point-and-shoot on quite a lot of occasions. For cameraphone buffs, the choice between the Pixon12 and Omnia HD could be quite a tough one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Pixon12</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another in-house competitor we thought of is the Windows Mobile-powered Omnia II. Samsung were smart enough to make the devices different enough, but this shapes up more like a friendly meeting than a deathmatch. But then, if a large AMOLED screen and all-in-one smartphone capability is your weapon of choice, then it will boil down to WinMo vs. Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Omnia II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot help but mention the other handset that boasts the letters HD in its name. What seems an absurd claim in terms of video is quite a well-argued statement about screen resolution. The HTC Touch HD is no match for the Omnia HD when it comes to imaging, but elsewhere it's a pretty tough call between these heavyweights. And here ends another chapter in the WinMo versus Symbian clash, or as it has now become, TouchFLO against TouchWiz.</paragraph>
