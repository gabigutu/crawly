			<paragraph>I have been longing for a phone like Nokia 6230 for a long time. All existing models have been made with a lot of compromises: one model was lacking in one thing, another one was lacking in something else. But Nokia 6230 has everything. This article is meant to inform you about my experience over a few weeks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may ask why I did not choose Nokia with Symbian OS. The answer is very simple: it's too big, has insufficient control options, lacks an MP3 player and hasn't got enough power. I also did not like the Nokia 3650 because of its unnatural keys, nor the Nokia 6600 because of its size, nor the N-Gage because of the impossibility to use it with one hand. Nokia 6230 does not feature Symbian, but it does feature everything necessary for a mobile phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Consistency <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Click on the thumbnails for full resolution pictures.  Conservative form ? Size in accordance with the latest tendencies  ? Camera on the back panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Volume control buttons ? Power button, also used to switch the profiles ? Pop-port</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6230 is offered in two colors - light and dark. The form is totally square which is in accordance with the modern tendencies. What lends some color to the modest look is the unique design of the rear panel where the infraport and lens are located. The keys are in a block and there is no space between them. For the sake of change, the middle column is a little bit wider.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dark wallpapers? Forget it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is pretty small, 128 x 128 pixels, as it is on the other Series 40 models. The small size of the display looks embarrassing at first glance, but fortunately, Nokia interface designers have used the space effectively. There is more information on the display than on other competitive models with bigger displays. The Nokia 6230's colors are bright and clear, thanks to the active display (TFT), a lot better than the STN displays Nokia uses in other Series 40 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The TFT display looks good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display, as the telephone itself, is very responsive. I haven't experienced such speed in a mobile phone in a long time. Any kind of wallpaper can be set on the display, but if it's too dark the information on it (date, hour, battery) cannot be clearly seen. The letters' color cannot be changed and the only possibility for the customer is to use a brighter image for the wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Black wallpaper? Bad idea</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Message for everyone <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph> High quality keyboard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the left key possibilities are limited, because the 5-way navigation key carries out its primary function. Compared to the previous model, it isn't used for working with the Menu, but for confirmation by pressing in the middle. In the beginning, I often pressed something else instead of confirmation. A day passed on, then two - I still was making mistakes. It took a whole week of hard practice before I became perfect using the keys. It also took a long time to get used to the fact that the left key does not confirm most actions. You need to relearn the keys if your pervious telephone was Series 40. If the 6230 is your first Nokia, you should be happy about that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quick to the functions <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I was pleased with the expertly designed menu. When you move the cursor on the left, you turn on the editor, the calendar is on the right, photo and video is upwards, and contacts is downwards. The Left key function is disabled when the cursor key is pressed in the middle. It is not necessary to use the main menu at all. You can use the right key to perform a call, new MMS, and to use the calculator. What is not clear is how the function choice is made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phone menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Changing the menu colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the beginning I was touting Nokia for creating a telephone with an ordinary size and all the main and useful functions. The integrated memory is not sufficient if you'd like to use all the possible images or to make video recordings or to play music. 8 MB are not enough for music. Who would like to listen to one song twice? One of the main Nokia 6230 novelties is the MMC card slot, 32 MB memory in a standard package. But it is insufficient as well, so it is better to buy an additional card of at least 128 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Audio Manager copies music in the telephone memory only. Phone Manager is not connected with the card, so if you'd like to record some music, you will need a card reader. It is recommended to quicken the transfer rate as well. If you don't have a card reader, you have to copy the data onto Audio Manager and then transfer it to the telephone card, but this is way too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other difficulties might be encountered using the card, because of its position - under the battery. If you have to copy data often, each time you have to turn off the telephone, take the card out, copy the data and put it back again. The audio player is pretty simple indeed, but it's enough. The player can play AAC and MP3 files, which can be stored in the memory or in the card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The card slot is under the battery</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MP3 player and radio <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sound quality is pretty good. The maximum volume might not be enough when you are in the discotheque, but it's enough for the cases when you're in the bathtub or at work. It's better to use the included headset if you'd like supreme quality. If you use the Pop-Port, you can't select anything else. You need two headsets if you'd like to listen to music at the same time. But everything twines in the pocket, as you know. Too many wires are not handy and it's easy to forget the second headset. You can skip a song using the key on the headset, but you cannot improve the sound - you need to take the telephone out of the pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The headset is connected to the Pop-port</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can listen to the radio if you are bored. But you need additional headset, which will act as antenna. The radio will not work without it. Twenty stations can be stored in the memory. It can be automatically tuned, but RDS cannot automatically choose a station; it should be done manually. The sound is stereo and it is very good. While I'm sitting on a table and writing, the signal I receive is without any noise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multitasking <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio player and the radio can work at the same time; you can write SMS, use WAP while your telephone is working. When it is ready for work, the song name or the actual radio station appears on the display. I know that when a manager works, he has no time for listening to music. And I do not claim that this is the main telephone advantage, but why don't use it if you have it? Since most users consider listening to music as an important thing, you'll be glad to know that the telephone can play music for more than 20 hours. However, I haven't tested the radio. So, if you intend to listen to one or two albums, be sure that the Nokia 6230 has enough power to perform long time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Thousands of contacts <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Every successful businessman has acquaintances with hundreds of people. Some of them he meets every day, others - once in a year. But all the contacts are saved in his telephone to be at hand when he needs them. The Nokia people have become aware of these necessities and that's why the new model is equipped with really huge memory. Data of thousands of people can be stored in it - their addresses, e-mails, etc. You can receive this information only by choosing the first letter. But the excitement from the new telephone is obscured almost instantly - you will encounter troubles at the minute you decide to synchronize the data with the Outlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Contacts search ? Numbers in SIM and phone memory </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synchronizing software displays the personal name first, then the family name and the reason for that is not known. What I mean is, when you call Mr. Novak, you should remember that his name is John. I hope that you won't get lost among your twenty acquaintances with the same name in your phonebook. It's a pity that the Nokia of Series 40 doesn't store personal and family names as separate segments, so to be selected in accordance with users' needs. I have no more remarks about the phonebook; it performs well as a whole. If you store a new contact into the telephone, you can write the family name first, then the personal one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Everything rings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In contrast to the prior model of the Series 40, the Nokia 6230 ringing volume is loud enough. The sound resembles the Symbian, and is even better. Standard melodies are nice, but they differ from the usual MP3 or AAC music. Any recorded (in the card or in the memory) melody can be used as a ring tone. Different ringing tones can be assigned to different contact groups. You cannot miss a ring - it is loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Changing profiles</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>That's a keyboard!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's very easy to write a text messages thanks to the perfect keyboard. T9 glossary contains well-chosen words so you can learn a lot of colloquial words and unusual phrases. If you have good eyesight you can decrease the font size so to see eight rows on the display instead of five. Although my eyesight is good enough, ultimately I went back to the five-rows setting. Thanks to the cursor key possibility to select quickly you can write a new text instantly. You can classify the messages by groups, but I have never done it. I leave them in the Archive and erase them at once to prevent the memory from overloading. However, in this case it's possible to delete unread messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Writing SMS, two different font sizes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although I have often sent graphic messages using MMS, nowadays I'm not so obsessed by them. MMS practical function is more important to me. You can send a picture from the memory using MMS, you can shoot, record music, video clip, any kind of short multimedia the phone can work with. Before sending it be sure that the receiver can deal with the sent format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Creating MMS</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eight Mega<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As I've already mentioned Nokia 6230 has extremely huge memory compared to the competition. MIDI, pictures, photos and video can be stored in 8 MB. Files can be copied and transferred at random among the memory card elements, the same as it works in a computer. The main file types are associated with the corresponding applications, so it is not necessary to turn an audio player on, if you'd like to listen to some music, just open the appropriate file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Gallery - pictures, video, audio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Showing pictures and video ? More than 8 MB total memory</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Java programs can be installed as well and you have almost 2MB at disposal. Each programme should be up to 128 KB. Such limitation is rather hypothetical because a programme of such size is not used in practice. I haven't tried the games, because this mobile phone includes a lot of useful functions to play with. When it comes to a telephone like this, games do not affect the decision for purchasing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I do not know if every user will need the full functionality of the organizer. I used to write everything in my old telephone but my engagements constantly increase and that's why the 6230 is a great relief for me. All data can be synchronized wit the Outlook. The communication with PC Suite is perfect. It's enough to connect the telephone with the Nokia PC Suite profile, then select the connection through Bluetooth in the Connection Manager and then select the right device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calendar, very useful</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Notes</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia PC Sync ? Audio Manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone Browser was the only thing I had problems with. It was hardly possible to see anything in the Galerie components. Fortunately, it's possible to reach the memory through OBEX File Transfer. The computer can be connected with the telephone through cable or infraport.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Editing pictures ? Nokia Phone Browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What I like very much is the alarm clock. You can set it to ring whenever you want with any kind of music, stored in the memory or in the radio. There are additional details in the telephone which not only every manager welcomes, but every user as well. Wallet function is very useful. It allows you to store different codes or passwords you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The alarm clock is just great</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator, Stopwatch</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo and video <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6230 built-in camera will help you to catch the magic of a moment. The photos quality is not very good; images are a little bit fuzzy. They are appropriate for MMS but not for you family album. However, the built-in video camera is much better. It can record sound as well and you need very short time to send the image as MMS. In my view, the video camera is much more convenient than the photo camera - you can use it to record a crime or transport breach. The telephone is in your hand and the police are far away. Several times I've recorded drivers who do not stop on red light, but unfortunately car registration cannot be seen clearly. So, spy function is a point at issue. But you can record everything during your vacation, so even your granny can see what you have done there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera lens ? The photos are a little bit fuzzy </paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery run for three days when I normally used the telephone. But I wasn't obsessed by listening to music yet. I haven't dialed too much, and the telephone usage hardly was more than an hour per day. If you do not dial often, the battery would hold even for five days. Naturally, everything depends on what you do with the telephone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusions <subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I have no troubles with Nokia 6230, there is not negligence as a whole. I was surprised by its price, which lowered according to the initial one. Today is not valid the saying that the good telephone should be expensive and Nokia 6230 confirms it. At a reasonable price you can receive everything without Symbian OS, which Java partially compensates.</paragraph>
