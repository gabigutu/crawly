			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This site is usually all about the features and performance, but not today. It's our day-off so we decided to go shopping. Well, window-shopping to be more depressingly precise. And the only bags we brought home are those under our eyes. Sometimes glitter is indeed gold - or better - and it sure can blind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We may've seen it all: from basic phones that scratch a living out of calling and texting to technological triumphs. And they all used to make sense. Today's a challenge for our sense of right and wrong. What we are looking at are some outrageously expensive handsets for the uber rich who have more money than...ok, let's face it... us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you find insanely overpriced featureless handsets a complete waste of time and human effort you better stop reading right now. But if you recognize the limited-edition handcrafted diamond-encrusted models as a form of artistic expression then you might be informed and entertained. Oh, and feel free to be shocked. Even our hardened geek hearts couldn't help but skip a beat when we handled those 40,000 dollar pieces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No one buys these handsets for their functionality, user-friendly interface or great reception. In fact, no one buys these handsets is where every right-thinking person would've stopped. But no sir, these things do sell, be it with just one purpose: to flaunt just how much you have. By the way, a certain group of users may find this review particularly upsetting. Nokia Arte, Motorola Aura or Samsung Ego owners seem to like feeling superior to the rest of the crowd, but they are going to look like poverty-stricken cheapskates next to the heavy hitters we are about to review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phones in this review are all of the love-it-or-hate it type. None of these could ever be called a sensible purchase, but the surprising number of boutique handsets available does suggest there is demand, even in these economically tough times. So who are we to judge if the money could be better spent elsewhere when the users end up happy and wanting more?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a small aside, we would like to make the case that every reviewer should get to keep the handsets they test. How about that? Looking back at all the top notch phones we've had to give back over the years sure hurts. Alright, we never really made fuss about it until now but we're off to a trade union meeting as soon as we finish this article. And this time we mean it because this time it's different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we have here is a bunch of Vertu phones, a couple of diamond-encrusted Goldvish handsets and a bonus track - TAG Heuer's Meridiist. This last one with its tongue-twisting name doesn't even come close to the grandeur of its companions, nor has it been so aggressively marketed. But the underdog quickly became the favorite around the office. And the paltry 5000 US dollars on its price tag almost had us ready to torture-test it. No offence meant, out of the whole bunch the Swiss chap sure was our kind of stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On second thoughts, if you have to ask about the price, then you probably can't afford it anyway, so it's probably best that we put away our wallets and focus on the job in hand. There are quite a lot of handsets waiting and the patience of the nobility shouldn't be tested. The review begins on the next page with one of the Vertu offerings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vertual insanity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vertu is a British-based manufacturer and retailer of luxury mobile phones and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nokia. They seem to have been around forever (7 years is ages in mobile phone terms), working towards their goal of making mobile phones in the same vein as luxury watch manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vertu handsets are unique for their supplemental Concierge feature - a 24-hour service, accessed by a single press of a dedicated button. It connects you to an operator who's there to help you with virtually anything you need - for a private jet press one. Money has no accent but the service is available in several languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course it is hard to imagine that a person who buys a Vertu won't have staff to do that for them so the real pull of Vertu are the materials used and of course the status they convey. The first model we are going to look at is even harder to imagine in the hands of someone driving a Porsche as for Vertu it's Ferrari all the way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vertu Ascent Ti Ferrari: Luxury in the fast lane<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The black titanium body of the Vertu Ascent Ti Ferrari feels incredibly nice in the hand. It's perfectly complemented by the hand-stitched leather which is identical to that used in Ferrari interiors, and coming from the same Italian tanneries. If all that sounds too pretentious and pointlessly over the top, then you better stop reading - it's all downhill from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or maybe not quite after all: the Vertu Ascent Ti series - and the Ferrari edition - are the most technologically advanced of all the phones in this article. But it's important to get this into perspective - in the world of luxury handsets a 3MP camera and a display that's actually usable are rarer than a giant panda (Pandas are unfortunate creatures).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the question that needs to be asked is this: won't a Vertu user feel robbed when a 100 buck handset does tricks that their high-priced handset can't? It's kinda like driving your Ferrari on the highway only to find out that every other sedan out there can go faster than you. Granted, they don't look as impressive doing so, but you still feel like you should have been treated better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the Vertu exquisite exterior we come to one of the two things we are not really fond of. The chevrons on the sides of the Giallo and Rosso Editions are said to recall the front of a Ferrari, but it's something of a letdown to discover they are made of rubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot complain at all about the other reference to the red cars though - the battery cover echoes the sweeping bonnet of a Ferrari and looks really nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the handset is where its Vertu heritage really shines through. The sapphire crystal display and the stainless steel keys are a typical part of all handsets from the British maker and very impressive they look too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time they also come with a really nice backlighting that is located under each wave of buttons and directed upwards. Photos hardly do any justice to the wonderful effect they create in the dark, so we are afraid you will have to see it to believe how brilliant that actually looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the comfortable and attractive keypad cannot make up for the sins of the disastrous joystick. It's so hard to use in any direction that we would easily place it in the top three worst phone controls ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, a sloppy gear stick does not exactly make any car a joy to drive, right? We are absolutely baffled why a company that takes such pride in its passion for design, engineering and performance would let such a shoddy decision make it to the final product, let alone a 9000 dollar piece of gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But leaving those worries aside, at least the display of the Vertu Ascent Ti is half-decent, except for the size of course. Small though it is, at least it's fine in terms of contrast and brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final noteworthy part of the Vertu Ascent Ti Ferrari bodywork are the two 11x15mm loudspeakers, located either side of the device. Their output is really pleasing, although we cannot see how much better (if at all) it is than other handsets since we didn't have the time to carry out a proper test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our tour of Luxury City was off to a great start in the yellow Ascent Ti Ferrari and the bar was raised quite high design-wise. Luxury and simplicity are in fine balance and the handset does look impressive. Usability though is a whole different story: the appalling joystick almost makes us wish this Ferrari had automatic transmission.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Packaging and extra goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The paper cover of the Vertu Ascent Ti Ferrari retail package is hardly impressive, but the (we're guessing hand-sewn again) leather below certainly is. Extraordinary and exquisite, it leaves no doubt that there's a really expensive handset waiting for you inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accessories aren't quite as inspiring - Vertu have only gone as far as rebranding the Nokia chargers, data cables, etc. The second battery is a nice bonus and there's also a really slick Ferrari-branded key for unlocking the battery compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface used by the Vertu Ascent Ti is good old S40 - yes, it has received a slight face lift and some Vertu branding but that's basically it. We were pretty disappointed at first, with the S40 being quite dated and not really competitive, only to find out later that this was by far the best interface used in the whole luxury bunch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One would think that having splashed thousands of dollars on hardware and with no limitations on either compactness or weight would make it easy to create a functional and user friendly handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet software development is obviously something that the makers featured here have little interest in. And the Vertu Ascent Ti has already shown just how little thought they gave to it, using the ready-made S40 solution from Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final feature of the Vertu Ascent Ti that we are going to discuss before moving on (there's quite a lot of handsets waiting) is the camera. Yep - you heard it right. The big fella has a 3.2 MP autofocus camera, a first in the Vertu family. As you might guess, this doesn't make it the best cameraphone money can buy. But think of it this way: it's the most expensive one you'll ever find and the price tag just won't peel off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vertu Constellation Rococo: Chic simplicity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next one up in this impromptu review is the most basic of them all. Well, basic is not quite the word we're looking for but if you somehow pull yourself together and stop staring at the price tag, you may get the idea. By the way, at 8000 US dollars the Vertu Constellation Rococo is perhaps the cheapest Vertu handset. Entry level, so to speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not like it looks common or anything - certainly not with a name like that. The Vertu Constellation Rococo is just a bit understated compared to the rest of the handsets in this article. No compromise is implied though with the quality of the materials. The makers claim the handset was inspired by aeronautics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stainless steel body is something you might even find on a regular phone, but the hand-finished leather and the sapphire crystal display are certainly rare. Not to mention the ceramic keypad, which has 1100 laser-drilled holes, hand-filled with a light-permeable lacquer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rococo unit that we had for this particular review also features embroidery on the leather, which comes in a choice of four colors - sapphire (as in our case), noir, ivory and scarlet. Other noteworthy decorations are the engraved bezel and the cabochon sapphires in the D-pad and on the sides of the front panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is rather more compact than the Ascent Ti Ferrari, and feels a tad lighter in hand. However, at 140 grams it still gives that marvelous solid impression that the fans of expensive handsets will surely appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as usability is concerned the keypad of the Rococo certainly makes a good impression with its terracing and V-shaped (as in Vertu-shaped) styling. The press is also great, for comfortable typing and expensive feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the keys: volume rocker on the right and concierge button on the left, along with the D-pad are pretty comfortable too, making the handset very user-friendly and nice to use. Unlike the cooler looking Ferrari we took for a spin in the previous chapter, the Vertu Constellation Rococo feels more like a Jaguar. It might not turn as many heads but it certainly has a charm of its own and greater roadability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also pretty pleased with the sound, delivered by the two large speakers, located on the two sides of the handset. Once again those are not there to justify the price tag or anything like that - they are more like a little something to make you feel different in a good way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Packaging and extra goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vertu Constellation Rococo comes in a box that is quite a lot smaller and somewhat less impressive than the Ferrari package. It still throws in a bit of leather and is nothing like the box of any regular phone so we might just be getting a bit picky after all that luxury we're treated to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside you will find a bunch of rebranded Nokia accessories and a key for releasing your Constellation Rococo's battery cover. It looks a lot simpler than the Ferrari's key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface in the Rococo is again the time-tested S40, spiced up with a couple of nice extra applications. Here might be the right time to mention that the interface of each Vertu comes with a theme that is specially designed to suit the exterior. And they do pretty well we might add, an almost perfect match for the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rococo design is obviously feminine and a very subtle, especially compared to the Ascent Ti Ferrari. All those floral ornaments on the outside and the inside look pretty sweet though hardly too expensive. And looking expensive is half the job those handsets need to do as far as we know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd be pretty happy with having one of those, although to be honest, the Blue version won't top our wishlist. The simplistic design looks way better when it comes in Black if we're to be asked. Come to think of it though, a team of geeks is hardly the right people to ask about insanely expensive and functionally-crippled handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're free to disagree, but you're welcome to join us on the next page or you risk missing some more Vertu action.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vertu Signature S: Making an impact<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If the first thing to cross your mind at first sight of the Vertu Signature was a TV remote control, it may be reassuring to know you're not alone. But don't go telling everyone and making a big deal out of it. The elongated handset is the key product in the company portfolio and the Brits are taking great pride in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when a company like Vertu feels that a handset is worthy of being called "a masterpiece of craftsmanship" we are obliged to take a look. The handset is said to be the epitome of Vertu creativity and excellence and we really wanted to see how that worked out. Besides, having Wi-Fi onboard surely didn't hurt its chances of making it in the article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vertu Signature is the first line of phones to be hand-built by a single craftsman. The company trusted their very best and most experienced craftsmen with the task and so each handset is signed by the person who painstakingly created it. Now, if that isn't screaming exclusivity we don't know what does. Here goes a video that we snatched from the Vertu official web site, than should walk you through the manufacturing process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The face of the handset is covered by a "Sea of Sapphire", or more simply said, sapphire crystal glass. The manufacturer claims this alone takes more than two weeks to create in a 2000°C furnace. It is said to be so hard to scratch, that it has to be cut, ground and polished with diamond-tipped tools. We are willing to believe the good people at Vertu on that, simply because we didn't have the nerve (or the budget) to test it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did have the opportunity to test the patented keypad of the Vertu Signature though and we have to agree with the maker. It is simply great to touch and use. And we are not saying that because we know that there are 4.75 carats of solid ruby bearings below each button. Really, ergonomics are as good as they get at the size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These ruby bearings slide on pure sapphire crystal surfaces that are aligned so that no part of the metal keys touches the sapphire face of the phone. The result is no friction, no wear and a really pleasant clicking sound, which Vertu call the "world's most satisfying click". We guess that's exactly what the world's most expensive click should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad doesn't have a Ruby bearing of its own but is still comfortable enough to use. We are starting to suspect that this V-shaped alignment is a pretty good idea that might find a good place in the regular handsets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Vertu Signature S is certainly the best we saw for the whole review, and even more so in the dark. Sure enough, the keypad backlighting is not as impressive as on the Ferrari edition, but the usability of two cannot be compared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact we were pretty surprised to find out that the weight of the elongated handset is well balanced and it doesn't feel head-heavy at all. We have seen several such handsets that tend to have a higher center of mass and are thus rather easy to drop. This is certainly not the case here and the Signature S feels much better in the hand than one might suspect by looking at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, the number of buttons on the sides of the phone is pretty limited. You've got the concierge button on one side and the volume rocker on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Vertu Signature S is finished in stainless steel and black leather and sports a battery cover lock that's different from the other Vertu handsets. If you find steel too plain, you can of course opt for platinum, white or yellow gold. The platinum version even has a diamond in the D-pad center.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Packaging and extra goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two batteries and the typical Vertu branded peripherals are no longer a surprise. However Wi-Fi connectivity is certainly nice to have onboard for a change. It is a unique feature for the class at the very least, and uniqueness is certainly appreciated here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another unique feature of the Vertu Signature S is the selection of ringtones. They are all from a piece of music composed exclusively for Vertu by Academy Award winning composer Dario Marianelli. The pieces were performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and all the flute solos were performed by Andrea Griminelli, one of the world's leading flautists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software package is also somewhat more advanced with some extra Vertu services complimenting the Concierge in the S40 UI. You have the Vertu Fortress secure backup service and the Worldmate travel application. The menu icons have been nicely redesigned too. Anyway, the software is the very last reason why anyone will go for a Vertu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vertu Signature: Old but Gold<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now Vertu Signature is the most expensive (at about 25,000 US dollars) of the Vertu lot that we meet today. It's 7 years old and all of its features are long outdated, but let's face it - a phone made of gold hardly needs a confidence boost and it hardly goes out of fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the original Vertu Signature is still impressive enough but the signs of age are inevitable. The most notable is of course the unfolding antenna at the top of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We cannot quite remember the last time we saw a phone like that. Eventually, some things old-fashioned do make comebacks but phones with pull-out antennas are still waiting their turn. Owners of this Vertu Signature edition who haven't upgraded aren't likely to be too upset though. Getting giggles from passers-by is not exactly the desired effect but hey, it's still a solid gold handset on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomics of the phone are pretty decent but a quick glance at the display is enough to tell it's an ancient unit you're dealing with (in mobile phone terms anyway). Underneath the scratch-proof sapphire crystal lays a mediocre 4K color TFD display. The Signature is one of the first handsets to use the transflexive technology that made Nokia's name in cellphone displays, but considering its poor indoor performance, it's hardly a great consolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we won't go in much more detail as there are a couple of other brands waiting. We are just going to say that the original Vertu Signature's design is somewhat more attractive to us than its overly-long and flat successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that was that about British virtue, we now head to the land of chocolate, banks and watches.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TAG Heuer: Clockwork<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Based in the town of Neuchatel, right on the northwestern shore of the namesake lake, Tag Heuer have been making top-quality timepieces for the past 150 years. The brand is founded by Edouard Heuer and his sons and is widely recognized for its involvement in elite sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has been the F1 official timekeeper since longer than we could remember. On the timepiece end, the company range currently includes product lines such as the TAG Heuer Formula 1, Monaco, Carrera, the SLR Chronograph and the Grand Carrera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company takes pride in producing some of the most accurate timekeeping equipment for decades now but it is a newbie in phones. We are curious to know if they managed to get that right too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TAG Heuer Meridiist: Right on time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>About a year and a half ago TAG Heuer announced their first handset - the Meridiist. Two things raised eyebrows back then - the peculiar name and the eccentric edgy design of the phone. We don't know about that first one but almost all questions about the second disappeared as soon as we held the phone. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and take a look at the exclusive background first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TAG Heuer Meridiist mobile phone is made of watch-making stainless steel and has two displays covered with unscratchable 60-carat sapphire crystal. There's also leather at the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary display is uniquely placed on the top side of the handset and shows the current time, the incoming call ID or the stopwatch if the latter is turned on. Seriously - you didn't think they would resist the temptation to brag with what they are best at, did you? There is even a dedicated button to start the stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TAG Heuer Meridiist is armed with a 1.9" primary display of QVGA resolution, while the secondary is an OLED unit at 96 x 76 pixels. The image quality is actually ok, but is totally let down by the rubbish interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is extremely basic, worthy of a handset like Vodafone 231 (no offence, Vodafone, ok?). It's not like S40 raised the bar too high, but the Meridiist UI is vastly disappointing. And yet it was only the beginning of a downhill slide that ended in flames with the GoldVish handsets that followed. Everything in its due time though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the TAG Heuer Meridiist is one of the things that impressed us the most about the handset. It was amazingly comfortable and, although we doubt it anyone will take messaging seriously on this handset, it certainly is a great tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the size of the keys and terraced layout seem pretty nice, while the press feedback is at a level worthy of a leading wristwatch manufacturer. And the stainless steel used makes things even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leather used for the back panel is somewhat less perfect than that. It's not that it isn't high-quality or anything - right on the opposite. There is a choice between calfskin and alligator, and even rubber if you prefer. It is exactly here that TAG Heuer put their experience with watch straps to good use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is that when you open the battery cover it doesn't detach. Instead it bends at a certain point, which we suppose will eventually get damaged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't know if TAG Heuer thought that users will never change SIMs or batteries or anything like it but don't quite agree with their design solution. It can't have been much harder to attach the leather at the bottom edge, where marks from bending are unlikely to appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other element of interest on the the TAG Heuer Meridiist rear is the 2 megapixel camera, hidden behind a steel lens cover. Tag Heuer claim it is good enough for a quality print of a standard 10 x 15cm photo, but we have our doubts. Nevertheless, this article is not about camera image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact leather box of the TAG Heuer Meridiist is hardly as impressive as some of those of we witnessed by Vertu but considering that this is the cheapest handset (costing the measly 5000 US dollars) in the bunch we are not gonna hold that against it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't an extra battery included in the package but, as the company claims, you will hardly ever need it. The Meridiist is rated at up to 28 days standby time or 7 of hours talk time due to its large battery and power-optimized components used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As time passed we gradually grew fond of the TAG Heuer Meridiist. Its edgy design is rather extraordinary in mobile phone terms but quite customary for the brand and the build quality is a worthy rival of the Vertu handsets. Now we cannot quite figure out how did they let that battery cover attaching slip but the final product is certainly impressive from a construction point of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure enough, the Meridiist will never deliver at the level of industry leading handsets that pack all the latest in mobile phone technology. But it's a tool that embodies the values of watchmaking: solid, reliable, classy and confident.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GoldVish: If you had one wish<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>GoldVish is another Swiss manufacturer, making the Swiss accountable for 2 out of the 3 brands in our article. The business is quite simple actually, never mind the obscene amounts of cash involved. Brits and Swiss make them, Russians buy them. Now, GoldVish is true Millionaire Fair stuff. Theirs is a pretty strict routine and they're in no mood to experiment. The GoldVish idea of a premium handset is gold and diamonds - nothing more, nothing less. And each GoldVish phone uses at least 150 grams of 18K gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the company got famous for releasing the world's most expensive phone. The 'Le million' Piece Unique comes with a full diamond coat, which secured it a place in the Guinness book of records. As to mass production (or whatever gets closest to that, as these handsets hardly sell by the million - pun intended) the company only has one line and we checked out two of their models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GoldVish Illusion: Your gold bar is ringing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid gold handsets are the GoldVish line of business, and diamonds are their ornament of choice. There are five handsets in the Illusion lineup, each coming in three different flavors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Illusion lineup it all boils down to what kind of gold (white, yellow or rose) and how many diamonds. The options vary from a single diamond in the confirm button of the Centerfold to 1639 stones in the ultra-exclusive 120,000 euro Like Heaven. What can we say - that's 1638 reasons for Centerfold owners to want to upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hate to break it to you but we only got the low-end GoldVish Illusion phones: the entry-level Centerfold (yellow gold) and the next-in-rank Violent Numbers (white gold). The name of the latter is a good enough warning of the extra 10 grand you'll need to splash on it. Or is it the diamond encrusted numpad they had in mind? Anyway, the Centerfold with its single stone costs 21,000 euro, while the Violent Numbers goes around at 31,500. The diamonds used are all VVS1 clarity certified, which means the only acceptable imperfections are minor ones that are not visible to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you paid attention you would have noticed the croc skin at the back of each handset. You can pick from up to 12 different colors for the back of your GoldVish but it doesn't end there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those rear inlays are available for purchase separately at around 500 euro a piece. It was never easier (and probably more expensive) to have your mobile handset match your evening outfit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our major disappointment with the GoldVish Illusion handsets is their performance. The company motto is luxury communication and we're willing to trust them on luxury. Not sure about the rest. We guess there's no need to fuss over ergonomics - hand feel is irrelevant as long as there's a handful of diamonds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The worse part however is the obsolete and utterly unintuitive interface. It's so terrible it must've been made by the same guys that skinned the crocodiles. A bit of graphics here and some more features there certainly wouldn't have swollen the price too much (certainly not beyond affordability).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is also pretty bad, but we kinda saw that coming. It's a 262K-color unit of 176 x 220 resolution. Oh well, more diamonds than pixels must be a fair deal to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty obvious we're dealing with jewelry rather than mobile phones here - they have to look pretty and expensive, rather than being practical. But it sure makes more sense to simply carry a solid gold bar in you pocket and a regular phone. After all, the design of the GoldVish is hardly much more inspiring, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, just to end on a positive note, we would like to mention the GoldVish retail package. The enormous box is crafted from fine wood and is a pretty expensive item itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a mirror inside, as you have every right to expect in a jewelry box. We just can't help but wish the team that made the box and the team that encrusted the handset each set one person aside to work on features and interface. You're right, we wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So to conclude, we aren't really in awe with the GoldVish handsets, despite them being perhaps the priciest of the lot. We guess GoldVish are equally unimpressed with a bunch of penny-pinching geeks, so it's all square and fair.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright then, we're gonna watch about 150,000 US dollars worth of mobile phones slip through our hands. There goes the title of the article but we won't fuss it. At least the million dollar liability coverage never came into force. Anyway, even if we reached the million mark we doubt it our conclusions would be any different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we hardly know anything about jewelry, so don't take our words for it. And no, we're not gonna tell you Vertu gets an edge out of a 3 MP camera, WLAN and Nokia-made interface. The rather obvious conclusion is just the opposite - the best handset is the one with the most diamonds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, these phones are out there and some people are buying. If you're next in line to unload a bag of cash, there's little we can say to change your mind. And don't let anyone tell you it can't be a smart buy. It can't be much worse than a Louis Vuitton hand bag, right?</paragraph>
