			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is the Android flagship to beat based on sheer sales, but the LG G2 one ups it in just about every way possible. Two South Korean neighbors and bitter rivals are once again standing in each other's way, and for us, users, choosing a side seems to have never been harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two smartphones have very similar design, build and features so you can pick either one and be on your merry way. However, there are differences - enough to make you want one of them more. The LG G2 has the advantage of using the latest tech available, while the S4 has already built up a user base in the tens of millions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we compare specs, we should mention that there are a ton of "Galaxy S4" phones, even when you don't count the mini and the Active. So it's worth pointing out that when choosing the G2 opponent in this heavy-weight battle, we picked the I9500 (Exynos 5 Octa chipset) and the I9505 (Snapdragon 600 chipset). With this in mind, here are the aspects where each phone has it better than its rival.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 over LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're quite impressed with the LG G2 squeezing a 5.2" screen with wafer thin bezels in a body that's virtually the same size as the 5" Samsung Galaxy S4 (or the 4.7" HTC One for that matter). It's thicker but that extra millimeter buys you optical image stabilization and more battery capacity. Also, the late release has allowed LG to use the brand new Snapdragon 800 chipset and spend more time equipping the camera with new tricks such as the 1080p @ 60fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 is by no means fat - it used to be our benchmark for a compact 5" phone. Despite being half a year older, the Samsung flagship isn't any cheaper than the G2 either. Still, the Galaxy S4 has its own set of tricks like the Super AMOLED screen that can detect your finger from an inch away and a repair-friendly design (the back cover and battery can be swapped out in a second).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's going to be a close fight and we'll have to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each phone. You can do it with us, starting with the hardware on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The "rounded rectangle" trend has all but killed meaningful debate on design, yet there's surprisingly much to say about the styling of the LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 feels like you're holding an edge-to-edge screen - like we said, LG has done an impressive job here. Only 2mm taller and 1mm wider than its opponent, the G2 fits an extra 0.2" of screen diagonal. When you put both side by side it becomes easily apparent that the LG's screen is bigger. To put that in concrete numbers that's 8% more surface area - it sounds smaller than it looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no buttons on the front or in fact the sides of the LG G2. We'll talk about what LG did with the standard Android keys in the software section, let's go find the hardware keys first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we find them on the back - hardly a surprise as LG made quite a big deal out of the ergonomics of this design - the volume rocker and the power/lock key are positioned in the midline, just below the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still have mixed feelings about it - the way we're used to holding big phones puts our index finger too high up, so we have to bend it (which is slightly uncomfortable) to reach the keys, while index finger and thumb are where these buttons are on the Samsung. However, that might just be a matter of habit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes a little time but you get used to holding the G2 in a way that lets you easily hit the keys with your index finger. That, however, means putting your hand lower on the phone making it all the more difficult to reach the top corners of the 5.2" screen (and 5" are already a stretch for some, even when putting your hand higher up around the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, you don't need the power/lock key for everyday use - the LG G2 can be woken up and locked with a simple double tap on the screen. Note that this uses the capacitive sensor on the screen and won't work if you tap anywhere else. The upside of this is that it detects the lightest of taps (which isn't the case with accelerometer based approaches like we've seen from Nokia). The downside for locking is that you need to tap on a blank space on the screen, free of widgets, icons and buttons, which is a pain if you have a busy homescreen (and in apps like the Calculator).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like the two ridges that flank the power/lock key - they prevent accidental presses when you put the phone on a table, but also keep the camera lens off the surface, minimizing chances of getting it scratched. There's a thin illuminated strip around the button too, which acts as a secondary notification light (great if the phone is face down).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has moved the loudspeaker to the bottom, so it doesn't get muffled on a table. The 3.5mm audio jack is also at the bottom, the setup is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 arrangement. This lets you put the phone top down in your pocket so you can just reach and pull it out right side up, but still comfortably connect a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 design is practically unchanged from the original Galaxy S from 2010 - if it ain't broken, don't fix it. And the design really isn't broken - you can hold the phone so that you can reach the top of the screen, which positions your index finger over the volume rocker and thumb over the power/lock key (vice versa if you hold the phone in your left hand).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Galaxy S4 sticks to the hardware Home button and two capacitive keys around it - Menu and Back. We like having a hardware button for some of the most used interactions with the phone, but the downside is that the arrangement is fixed - you can't add buttons to the bottom, but you can tweak on-screen buttons as we'll see with the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back, the camera protrudes from the body so the Samsung Galaxy S4 rests on it and the small nub on the loudspeaker grille when you put it on a table. That exposes the camera to potential scratches and the speaker still gets muffled. Samsung has kept the 3.5mm audio jack on top, pretty much standard these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the S4 has going for it is that it's a full millimeter thinner - it's a difference you can feel. The G2 is not uncomfortable to hold - in fact, the curve of its back makes it fit quite well in the hand - but the thinner body of the Galaxy S4 does make it feel more like a cutting edge gadget. The Galaxy S4 is also 13g lighter, which again is not a major difference but still a small advantage in terms of in-hand feel and user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover of the Galaxy S4 is removable, giving you easy access to the battery, the microSIM card and the microSD card. You'll need a tool to get to the microSIM in the LG G2 and, more importantly, its storage is fixed. Its battery is sealed too, but it's bigger - we'll find out if this tradeoff is worth it in the battery life chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The removable back also means you can easily swap out the admittedly unattractive (other than to fingerprints) back of the S4 with a third-party one or just because it got too damaged. To be fair, the G2's back is not much more stylish - it's a similar-looking glossy plastic. The pattern is different, but it's nothing like the Nexus 4's back so it makes no difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note the LG G2 comes only in Black and White for now, while the Galaxy S4 is available in many more colors (all with fancy names): White Frost, Black Mist, Aurora Red (AT&amp;T only), Arctic Blue, Purple Mirage, Brown Autumn, Pink Twilight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors aside, both the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 have their own versions of a flip cover with a window, called QuickWindow cover and S-View cover respectively. Here are a couple of promo videos that explain what they are all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Tie!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G2 won us over with its wafer thin bezels and compact size. We also like the attention to detail - like the ridges and LED around the power button, the better positioning of the loudspeaker and 3.5mm audio jack and even just the novelty of having buttons on the back for a change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has its own advantages, quite tangible and practical ones, too - thinner and lighter, expandable storage, easy access to battery and SIM card, which also means easy repair if the back gets scratched or if you need to use a second battery to last you through a busy day or a long trip (hike).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2's screen is bigger - but is that extra size really meaningful? After all, the on-screen buttons take out a chunk of the screen that's not accessible by anything but video players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those buttons take out 144 pixels out of the 1920 pixels of the screen (they are always on the short side). That's 7.5% of the screen real estate unavailable to apps. Subtracting that area leaves only 2% more screen real estate for apps running on the LG G2 than the Galaxy S4 offers. That 0.2" advantage is turning out to be mostly on paper (outside of the video watching scenario).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the display measuring contest out of the way, it's time to talk about the screens themselves. One is a True HD-IPS+ LCD (the G2) and the other is a Super AMOLED (the S4), both protected by Gorilla Glass 3. The edges on the LG G2 glass are ever so slightly rounded, making horizontal swipes a bit more natural and pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both screens are capacitive, but the Galaxy S4's digitizer is put into overdrive - it will detect your finger from an inch away, which enables some S Pen like gestures in the TouchWiz UI called Air View and, better yet, means you can use the S4 while wearing gloves (a major advantage in colder climates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's talk about the screens themselves - they differ on more than just size. The LG G2 has a True-HD IPS+ LCD screen while the Galaxy S4 uses Samsung's own Super AMOLED. The difference is clearly visible under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G2 screen under a microscope * Samsung Galaxy S4 screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 screen has a standard RGB matrix, no surprises there. The Super AMOLED uses a diamond-shaped subpixel arrangement, but due to the very high pixel density (441ppi), that's not visible to the naked eye. The thing about AMOLED is that all those dots are individual light sources that can be powered on and off as needed, so only a few pixels can be lit up to consume energy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This allows a clock with notifications to be displayed efficiently, which is used for the S View cover. The LG G2 has to backlight the entire 5.2" screen to display even one pixel, so the Quick Window covers use more power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are relatively minor things and having a whopping big backlight comes in handy when you need brightness - the LG G2 easily wins in this regard. It's 667nits vs. 404nits though keep in mind the Samsung plays tricks that make it hard to nail the brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's another problem - to display black pixels, the LCD has to block the backlighting. The LG G2 screen manages that very well, scoring 1,495:1 contrast, which is about as high as you can expect on an LCD screen (note that this is actual contrast with black and white next to each other, there's none of that "dynamic contrast" trickery that HDTV makers use).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An AMOLED display can, however, simply turn off the pixels that are black, so that they emit no light whatsoever. This gives it theoretically infinite contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most often though the screen isn't the only source of light - there are house lights and the sun. That light reflects off the protective glass of the screen and the screen itself, so even if black pixels are completely off, reflected light can still ruin the contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has put a lot of effort in minimizing reflectivity - one of the major advantages Super AMOLED had is that it attached seamlessly to the glass, without any air gaps causing glare. But LG started laminating its screens a while back, meaning there's no air gap there either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the end result is strongly in favor of the Samsung Galaxy S4. It took a small step back compared to the Galaxy S III, but it still has one of the best screens to use in direct sunlight. The LG G2 has a fairly disappointing sunlight legibility score of just under what the Apple iPhone 4 managed. Apple has greatly improved its screens since, while the G2 is beaten by a midrange HTC Desire 600 dual sim (to be fair the higher end HTC One mini is actually worse).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another place where the Samsung Galaxy S4 has an advantage is viewing angles. It's subtle but when you view the LG G2's screen at an angle you can see the white balance go from warm through neutral to cold. There's also a slight contrast degradation, while such effects are almost nonexistent on the Galaxy S4's Super AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 screen backlight could have been brighter, but 400nits is enough, too. The much better sunlight legibility is the bigger factor. The viewing angles, the more sensitive touchscreen (AirView and the ability to operate it with gloves) also seem like important perks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has a bigger screen, but not really after you subtract the surface of the on-screen keys from the total usable area. It has brightness going for it, but it's more reflective. LG also tout their screen as displaying colors much more accurately than AMOLED screens. Well, this is the case indeed, but color accuracy on a smartphone is not really that important to the user experience, unless your particular job requires it. And even if it were, a tablet would do a much better job, we think.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, the best flagship smartphone becomes a paperweight as soon as the battery runs out, so let's see how the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 manage. Mind you, it's two different versions of the S4 we'll be looking at: the I9500 (Exynos 5 Octa) and I9505 (Snapdragon 600). There's the Google Play Edition of the S4 too (Snapdragon 600 based, running vanilla Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has a bigger battery - 3,000mAh - that's sealed inside its body. The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a removable 2,600mAh battery. There's a difference in screen size and tech, but the chipsets are also different - we already covered the S4 situation, the LG G2 has a Snapdragon 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start off with the most basic function of a smartphone (emphasis on the phone). The LG G2 is the second best phone we've tested yet (behind the Huawei Ascend Mate, a 6" phablet with a 4,050mAh battery). The Galaxy S4 using the older Snapdragon chipset comes a full 7 hours behind - that's nearly a third less talk time. The Exynos-based Galaxy S4 managed just 11 hours, less than half of what the LG G2 did.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And what happens when the big screen comes on for a bit of web browsing? The LG G2 cleanly claimed the top spot there, no phablets to get in the way. The Galaxy S4 (Snapdragon 600 edition) is 4 hours behind, with the Exynos 5 Octa another half hour short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's important to note here that we run the tests at 50% brightness and the Galaxy S4 screen is brighter at that setting - 201nits compared to 149nits for the LG G2. If you adjust the G2 to 200nits (which is a fairly standard brightness level), its battery life will be reduced somewhat (but the Galaxy S4 still has no chance of jumping in front).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For video playback, the Samsung Galaxy S4 actually managed to snatch a victory by 40 minutes. That's for the Snapdragon 600 version running TouchWiz. This is also the only test where the Google Play Edition does as well as the TouchWiz version. The LG G2 gets a consolation prize of beating the Exynos 5 Octa powered Galaxy S4 by 20 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen brightness consideration applies here, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the overall rating. The LG G2 scores an impressive result of 62 hours between charges, so it will easily get you through two days of light to medium use and will survive a whole day at full throttle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 gets a few hours more thanks to more efficient standby. It's a marginal advantage that will be felt by light users, but powerful flagships are usually bound to be used and abused - which means a lot of web browsing and other tasks, at which the LG G2 is more efficient. Keep in mind you can always carry a spare battery for the Galaxy S4, though perhaps not many people do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 has an advantage in its standby power consumption, but the G2 will outlast it in almost all scenarios where the phone is actually being used, instead of just sitting idle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Software comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones run Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, so they're slightly behind AOSP. Not that 4.3 brought a lot of must-have features and both Samsung and LG are working on 4.3 updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each phone carries the most loaded version of its parent company's custom interface. We've seen them both plenty of times but since the flagships have new, exclusive features, it's worth to review them one more time before we go on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 have custom lockscreens, but they maintain that cool widget functionality that was introduced by Android 4.2 and add a few touches of their own. Both offer shortcuts on the lockscreen, but the ones on the Galaxy S4 are off by default as the custom widget on the right homescreen pane holds a grid of shortcuts. The LG G2 has the shortcuts and keeps the right pane as a camera shortcut as per stock Android specifications. You can tweak the galaxy S4 lockscreen to be the same effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we come to the homescreen - there's very little difference here, both allow you to add and remove homescreen panes and rearrange them via an overview mode. There are shortcuts in a dock at the bottom of the screen and so on. One thing the Galaxy S4 does that we like is that when adding a widget, it will show you the silhouettes of all panes and the widgets on them so you can quickly spot where free room for the new widget is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification areas are pretty similar too. A top row of quick toggles that can be hidden and rearranged, then a slider for the screen brightness and then the notifications themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG notification area is busier - it adds a volume slider under the brightness slider (neither can be hidden) and if you enable QSlide (we'll get to it in a minute) you lose another row for the mini app shortcuts. If you also enable the Quick Remote (IR remote controls in the notification area) you get literally no space for notifications, not a good thing on a large 5.2" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung lets you hide the brightness slider, to reclaim lost space. Also, if you drag out the notification area with two fingers or tap the button in the upper right corner you can see all toggles at once (similar to stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the display section we mentioned that the LG G2 has on-screen buttons and that their advantage is that you can customize them. The three standard keys are Back, Home and Menu and you can add to them the QuickMemo button or the Open notification area button. You can also pick between several arrangements, but unfortunately there's no App switcher button available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QuickMemo button is also available by tapping and dragging the Home button, it's next to the Google Now button, so we really think App switcher was more deserving of a place among the on-screen buttons than the QuickMemo button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has Guest Mode - it basically lets you select a pattern that unlocks the phone and puts it in Guest Mode, where only a selection of apps or content is available. This will make you more at ease when you give your phone to someone else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's talk multitasking, after all big screens and powerful chipsets were born for it. The LG G2 has two modes of multitasking - QSlide 2.0 and Slide Aside. QSlide 2.0 is a selection of floating mini apps that can be moved around, resized and made transparent. You can have up to 2 QSlide apps at any one time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of disadvantages with this - we couldn't find any QSlide compatible apps in the Play Store and you cannot interact with transparent apps. If make the texting app transparent to chat while watching the video, you'll discover you can no longer type in it, even though you can still see the text fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Slide Aside - using three fingers, you can swipe up to three apps off the screen and then bring them back out in order using another three finger swipe. It's very similar to how Chrome handles tabs, but since you need three fingers it's strictly a two-hand gesture. It's a nice way to navigate between a handful of apps but we find ourselves using the phone with one hand more often than two, so Slide Aside won't see much use, if you ask us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's solution is called Multi-window. Instead of taking up space in the notification area, it lives in a separate panel on the left or right (you can hide and show the arrow that opens the panel by long pressing Back). Instead of floating, overlapping windows, Multi-window splits the screen in two and each app gets one half. It doesn't have to be half though, you can easily adjust the screen ration of the two apps however you like. There are buttons to close one of the apps, to maximize one app (both are practically the same) and to swap their places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upside of this is that each app gets its own space rather than have some of its controls by the other app. Also, there are already a few apps that support Mulit-window available in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Note 3 Samsung has also made it possible two instances of one and the same app to run simultaneously (e.g. you can keep tap on two different web pages for instance or have two simultaneous chats with two different people) and we expect the Galaxy S4 to get it too with the Android 4.3 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung kicked off a competition of having the most advanced gestures and it's in the lead. We already mentioned Air View - hover your finger above the screen and you get preview of what's in a folder, what song comes next and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Screen is a suit of features, which includes Stay (screen is kept on as long as the front-facing camera can see your face), Rotation (the proper rotation is selected using the camera, not accelerometer, for when you're lying on your side), Pause (pause video if you look away from the screen) and Scroll (scroll by tilting your head).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the Air Gestures - you can wave your hand in front of the phone to scroll web pages, move between emails and songs and answer an incoming call. You can also place a call by lifting the Galaxy S4 up to your ear while viewing a contact in the phonebook or reading an SMS from them. Also, if you have missed notifications and don't see the LED light, Smart Alert will vibrate the phone when you pick it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's answer includes Smart Screen (the analog of Smart Stay) and Smart Video (basically, Smart Pause). There's also an option to fade out a ringtone when you pick up the phone and answer the call when you put the LG G2 up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's was a close call, but better multitasking, notification area management and more Smart this-or-that functions give the Samsung Galaxy S4 an edge over the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like the Guest Mode on the G2 (that's usually reserved for Android tablets) and Slide Aside seems like a curious feature, but these are not enough to come on top of Samsung's proprietary feaures.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App packages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 come with an extensive app package out of the box. Some of those apps are pretty useful, so they're worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser is one of the most helpful and both phones have pretty capable apps. However, the LG G2 has the edge since its file browser supports ZIP files and has Dropbox integration. LG has another very useful app - LG Backup. It can be used to back up everything from settings to downloaded apps and their data. It's great for people who don't want/know how to root their phone, but need an on-device backup solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have only an Office doc viewer from Polaris and get points deducted - a flagship should really come with an Office editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While both phones have capable music players, the LG G2 wins some points for playing 24-bit FLAC out of the box (the Galaxy S4 plays only 16-bit FLACs) and having an FM Radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 does earn back points for Adapt Sound, which tunes the equalizer based on your specific set of headphones. We'll look at the audio output quality of both smartphones in a separate test later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most interesting apps on the two phones is the remote control app. They can control TVs, set top boxes, projectors, DVD players, AV receivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG goes even further and adds air conditioning units but more importantly the option to learn commands from the devices existing IR remote - you can build your own remote, with a custom layout to control any device in the house that has an IR remote, which is great for home theater setups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have voice assistants - Q Voice for the LG G2 and S Voice for the Samsung Galaxy S4. They can make a call for you, transcribe a text you dictate, set alarms, check the weather and so on. Both have just about the same set of functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 utilizes its wide set of sensors (air pressure, humidity and temperature) for the S Health app, which can also pair with external sensors and with your input (of what you eat), it's supposed to help you stay in shape and track your progress towards your fitness goals. We've never really had smartphones as a big part of our health lifestyle but obviously it's a big market niche since Apple has even made a special co-procesor to allow their latest iPhone 5s to serve as a low-power all day activity tracker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Tie!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a backup app out of the box is very valuable, the IR remote is better, plus the small things like Dropbox integration in the file browser and FM radio are also pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 lacks a few things, but the Adapt Sound option is cool and the S Health app is one of the best exercise apps we've seen. You can get apps to fill in some of the gaps, though you can't get a proper backup app (without rooting or using a PC) and there's no software fix for a missing FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Time to see how the two flagships perform according to synthetic benchmarks. Well, not two but three - remember that the Galaxy S4 has two versions (one with Snapdragon 600 and one with Exynos 5 Octa), but both were tuned to have about the same performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG G2 should take an easy victory here because it has a newer chipset, the Snapdragon 800. By the way, Samsung has a Galaxy S4 with Snapdragon 800 too, it's just not available internationally (but crucially, it's available in South Korea).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's list the parts for those who don't know them by heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait 400 cores are faster than the Krait 300 ones even at the same clock speed, which is obviously not the case. The GPU on the Snapdragon 800 is also more powerful as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's Exynos 5 Octa that has four powerful Cortex-A15 cores at 1.6GHz and four power-efficient Cortex-A7 cores at 1.2GHz. At the moment only the A15s or only the A7s are active at any one time, but Samsung is working on an update to enable all 8 cores to work simultaneously. There's also 2GB RAM and a GPU of a different family - the PowerVR SGX544MP3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we're missing a few benchmarks for the Exynos 5 Octa version of the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's kick off with CPU benchmarks. The LG G2 is the first phone we've tested that goes under 100ms on BenchmarkPi, beating even the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which has the same chipset. The Samsung Galaxy S4 (both versions) is about 30% slower in single-threaded performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack puts the multi-threaded performance a hair above that of the Z Ultra and well ahead of the Galaxy S4s again by about 30%). Geekbench 3 doesn't quite agree - it puts the Sony Xperia Z Ultra on top, but the LG G2 is still ahead of the I9505 Galaxy S4 by about 20%.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to the GPU benchmarks to try and see how both versions of the Adreno do against each other and against the Power VR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first offscreen test - GFXBench 2.5 Egypt - shows a solid 10fps lead for the new Adreno 330 in the LG G2 and even more in the Xperia Z Ultra. Meanwhile, the PowerVR SGX544MP3 practically matches the Adreno 320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newer 2.7 T-Rex benchmark shows a closer gap - 5fps - but proportionally it's the same (25-30%). Keep in mind that 1080p is the actual screen resolution on these devices.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Section winner: LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benchmarks results are unanimous and it was hardly unexpected. The Snapdragon 800 inside the LG G2 is easily the most powerful mass market mobile chipset. A Snapdragon 800 version of the Galaxy S4 (and S4 Active if the rumors are to be believed) will make things more interesting in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not to say the I9500 and I9505 Galaxy S4 phones are slow - they are not, they're just slower than the G2 when the chipset is pushed to the limit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've covered the positioning of the loudspeakers on both phones and explained the pros and cons. Now let's look at just how loud those loudspeakers are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is louder in two out of three tests than the G2 and scores a Good mark, while the LG G2 only managed a Below Average. Note that this is with the loudspeakers not muffled - if you place the Galaxy S4 and the G2 on a table, the difference between the two gets smaller. As we already explained, the S4 loudspeaker tends to get muffled on flat surfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't completely muffle the poorly designed loudspeaker grille, the Samsung Galaxy S4 will be easier to hear when ringing or playing music out loud. It's not by a big margin, but there is no two ways about it, the LG G2 is quieter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output perfectly clean, but not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 showed perfectly clean output in both parts of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphones got excellent scores all over the field with the Galaxy S4 taking the slightest of edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scores stay close to perfect even when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk of the G2 worsens a bit more than on the Galaxy S4, which combined with the slightly higher volume levels on the Samsung flagship gives the Galaxy s4 the win here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest generation flagships from the South Korean companies both feature 13MP shooters, but they differ in terms of camera hardware and features, so before we delve into image quality we'll have a look at all the bells and whistles the LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy S4 offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the biggest difference is that the LG G2 camera offers optical image stabilization (OIS), which has very noticeable effects in low light photography and in video recording (without it, most videos look like shot by an amateur with shaky hands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not the only advantage the LG G2 has - it can record 1080p video at 60 frames per second, while the Galaxy S4 manages only 30fps. For action packed scenes this makes quite a difference as it makes fast motion appear very smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interfaces of the two cameras differ - LG is still using the traditional UI with the controls on either side of the viewfinder and there's a still/video mode toggle. It's not a bad interface - it's been around for a long time and it's familiar and functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung meanwhile has moved away from that style of camera UI and uses the clean UI we first saw on the Galaxy Camera. It's still very functional and most common options are a couple of taps away, no further than on the G2, but the viewfinder is less cluttered. The one downside is that the still and video camera viewfinders have been unified, meaning framing 16:9 videos can be tricky if you're shooting 4:3 stills (the still photo aspect ratio takes precedence and the viewfinder is 4:3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The field of view (FoV) for the LG G2 is slightly wider than the Galaxy S4 - not enough to make a big difference, but you'll fit just a little more in a G2 photo (the downside is that wide FoV can negatively affect fine detail).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera FoV is wider too (no surprise here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more thing we should note - the LG G2 shot to shot time is very short, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 takes noticeably longer. You can set up the volume rockers on both phones to act as still or video shutter keys (or a zoom lever), but since the one on the LG G2 is on its back, right next to the camera it's not very useful. Both have voice-activated shutters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's look at the party tricks - a lot of those are quite useful, not just gimmicks and a lot of them are identical on both phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, dual-shot lets you snap a photo or capture a video with both cameras simultaneously, so you can be in a group shot too, even if you're the one holding the camera. Both phones let you move around the picture-in-picture window, resize it and swap which camera captures the big picture and which one the small picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones offer burst shot, HDR (we'll look at samples later) and object removal. There's also automatic mode selection (the S4 also auto-detects night mode), geo-tagging and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has something called Time Catch shot - it captures a few photos before you even press the shutter key, decreasing the chance you've missed the perfect moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a few more tricks up its sleeve - Animated Photo (makes GIFs), Sound &amp; shot (records background audio for the photo, but these are hard to share) and Drama Shot (makes multiple copies of a moving object). Remote viewfinder lets you use a second Android device as a wireless viewfinder, while Tag Buddy will help you tag people in a photo by learning and recognizing their faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's for stills, video recording on the LG G2 also has been imbued with some tricks - Live Effects humorously distort people's faces in real time, while Tracking Zoom is another picture-in-picture effect, which zooms in on a part of the image (however, despite the name it doesn't track objects, you have to manually move the window). Audio Zoom boosts the microphone, which records the video sound, so it can highlight the sound of the subject you are zooming at (your kid in a choir, for instance, or a person you are shooting in a noisy street).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has a VR Panorama option, a Photo Sphere equivalent. The Galaxy S4 had a similar option but it has since been phased out by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 wins back some points by doing a better regular panorama - it does a full 360-degree circle and the result is a whopping 60MP image often weighing in at about 20MB. The LG G2 only does a small arc and stays below 10MP and 2MB in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 camera comes with all the bells and whistles you might expect from a flagship device. There is Optical Image Stabilization, 1080p @ 60fps video, faster shot to shot time and wider FoV sealed the deal. Those are enough to score nicely in this section, but we'll have a look at how good is this new video recording mode in our dedicated Video recording comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has more party tricks, but it has dropped the Photo Sphere option and LG has obviously made a point about matching all fancy camera features on the S4 and then it added a few on top of that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were expecting both phones to perform pretty similarly for still photography and we were right. They have slightly different image processing setups, which also affects look of the photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first crop shows a small advantage for the Galaxy S4 in terms of sharpness. However, if you look at the lines you'll see that the S4 applied more sharpening to the image than the G2, which certainly contributes to the perception for sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second crop is from the same photos, but taken from the ride side of the image. Here the Galaxy S4 photo is noticeably softer, especially when you look at the foliage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third row of crops shows a surprising difference in white balance - Samsung phones typically gravitate towards a cooler balance, but the Galaxy S4 photo came out noticeably warmer, while the LG G2 was a bit too cool. It was a cloudy day, but not quite as gloomy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, notice the oversharpening halo between the trees in the distance and the sky in the Galaxy S4 photo and that the roof has more detail than the GL G2 photo. You can apply some sharpening to the G2 photo and bring out some more detail, but not quite as much (it helps that the Galaxy S4 does this before the JPEG compression).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final pair of crops shows a difference in exposure - the Samsung Galaxy S4 photo shows more detail in the shadows and looks brighter overall than the LG G2 photo. Again, it was a cloudy day, but not quite that dark. You can also see the sharpening on the small lettering on the blue background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution shots we used to make the crops above, plus some extra samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the panoramas we shot with both phones. Again, the Galaxy S4 panorama weighs in at 20MP and has around 60MP resolution, so it may take a while to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the HDR samples next. The LG G2 brings in detail in both the highlights and the shadows, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 focuses on the highlights and mostly leaves the shadows untouched. Both phones carry over things like white balance and sharpening from the regular photos, but on the up side they don't increase noise or make the image softer (which can happen if the alignment of the multiple exposures isn't perfect).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, here are the full resolution shots that were used to make the crops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tie!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 had the sharper image more often than not (but by a really tight, pixel-peeping margin) and we like its white balance and exposure choices better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 on the other hand has a slightly wider field of view and its images don't look as processed, both of which will surely be some handy advantages to many of you. We also like the HDR mode on the G2 better. Note that we're not taking into account the low light capabilities of both phones, an area where we hope the OIS system on the G2 would provide a clear edge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is coming into this fight as the crowd's favorite (on paper, at least) - it has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and 1080p @ 60fps video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normally, the LG G2 shoots 1080p videos at 30 frames per second and they look smooth. Their bitrate is 20Mbps overall, with 156Kbps dedicated to 48kHz stereo audio. If you pick the 1080p @ 60fps mode, the overall bitrate jumps to 30Mbps for double the information it needs to record. Well, that's not exactly the case as the framerate is closer to 58fps most of the time. Still, it's enough for videos to be smooth, but may cause some syncing issues on 60fps displays. If you are proficient in video editing enough, you can potentially take these videos and slow them down on your computer, which would make impressive slow-mo 1080p footage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 tops out at 1080p @ 30fps and it uses 17Mpbs to do it. Audio bitrate is lower too - 128Kbps (sampling rate is the same, 48kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot one video with each phone from a tripod then a video with both at the same time, holding them in hand. There's also a 60fps sample from the LG G2, but no matching Galaxy S4 sample obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher bitrate of the LG G2 would make you think that it will score an easy victory here but that isn't the case, as it turns out. The LG G2 videos have the contrast much too high, making them look overexposed (but the shadows aren't well developed). Also, in terms of overall detail we've seen better 1080p videos, especially at such a high bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking the phone in the hand didn't affect the image quality, as can be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 60fps video mode, however, proved to be a disappointment as turning it on, caused a drop in the perceived resolution - the letters all but fade out and the diagonal line becomes jaggy. It's similar to when the first 1080p video phones hit - they did better at the tried and true 720p, the LG G2 is better at 30fps than the new 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast aside, the LG G2 videos suffer from an overly sensitive continuous autofocus and auto exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 packs more details in its videos despite the lower framerate. Part of that is surely due to the better exposure and contrast settings. Both phones use the same compression - AVC High@4.0, CABAC 1 Reference frame - so we can't attribute the Galaxy S4 advantage to more efficient compression. The lower bitrate however allows for smaller file sizes, something which the G2 clearly has to watch out for with its limited amount of built-in storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The warmer white balance we saw in the stills is in place here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not having an OIS system is the one thing that hurts the Galaxy S4 videos - they have the handheld look that reminds us of old timey home videos, while the LG G2 stabilization makes videos more appealing. We'll see how its stabilization holds up when we test it against the HTC One, which was the first Android to have OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the 1080p @ 30fps videos we shot with a tripod.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handheld videos we combined into a single video to make the advantage of OIS more apparent. This video is also good at showing just how much different are the exposure and contrast on both videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a 1080p @ 60fps video form the LG G2 if you're curious about that (YouTube doesn't support 60fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 comes up with videos, which have more fine detail, better contrast and smaller file sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the LG G2 optical stabilization makes for nicer, more fluid videos, when the shakiness of the Galaxy S4 videos can clearly take away from the amount of perceived detail unless you really rest the Samsung smartphone on something (as we did with our tripod) to offset this disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we'll surely be on the lookout for a future fix of the exposure and contrast tuning and the overeager continuous autofocus of the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p@60fps turned out a flop and we doubt the company can do anything for it post-release. Its presence only makes the job of the marketing people easier, but with this lesser quality, we doubt it will see much real-life use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera image quality: low-light stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We took a series of photos in low light with both phones. We tried just shooting on normal with flash disabled, normal with flash enabled and in night mode (night mode disables the flash automatically). Below you'll find a crop that shows the best and worst shot of each group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos from the LG G2 are almost the same on normal without flash and on night mode. There is an important difference though and that is night mode shots were more consistent, while several normal mode shots turned out blurry despite the optical image stabilization of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, photos look very soft but the G2 processing algorithm has removed almost all of the noise and images look passable if you don't plan on viewing them at full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has automatic night detection, which enables night mode automatically. We disabled that to see if there's a difference between normal and night mode. And there is - the normal mode shots look dark and very grainy, while night mode shots are brighter and there's less noise. There's not a lot more detail but night mode photos do look better. Both modes are fairly consistent when it comes to image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the phones with flash off as it won't do much difference for faraway subjects and landscapes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash photography on phones is really for when you're shooting something pretty close up. The Galaxy S4 proved to have a slightly more powerful flash that filled our test scene more evenly. This also gave it a noticeable advantage in terms of detail - if your hands are steady, photos with flash turn out pretty good (but even the flash doesn't help the S4 inscrease the shutter speed enough to eliminate handshake issues).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weaker flash on the LG G2 didn't help it out a ton - photos do come out brighter, but they don't have that much more detail. The G2 does perform more consistently thanks to the image stabilization and it has slightly more accurate colors with the flash on, the Galaxy S4 photos have a dark yellow tint to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a few photos outside after the sun came down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Section winner: Tie!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its Optical Image Stabilization, the LG G2 has the upper hand when the flash is off - depending on what photos you'll be taking, this might be the most important scenario. The Samsung Galaxy S4 avoided defeat by performing better with the flash on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is living the dream. The Galaxy line of phones is becoming synonymous with Android for some people, thanks to quality being consistently delivered, but strong marketing too. LG's volumes are lower but it takes one hero device to act as an awareness-raiser and that doesn't get much better than the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many people are looking at it as the foundation for the upcoming Nexus 5 (like the Nexus 4 was based on the Optimus G) and we can see why - it's hard to find a fault with the device. Individual elements can be criticized (e.g. plastic unibody instead of aluminum) but the overall package shapes up to be as the leader in the Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG secured a hardware edge for the G2 over the Galaxy S4 by launching half a year later, but Samsung has already sold millions of this generation and is probably already looking towards the S5 now that the Note III is out of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G2 ? Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 scored tie on most of our head-to-head tests an in the few test it actually won, it won by a respectable margin - these include the performance tests and the battery life score. And even if Samsung comes up with an international Snapdragon 800 powered Galaxy S4 refresh, it would still only be able to match the G2 scores and hardly beat them. But don't get this wrong, even the mere fact that the G2 scored mostly tie to the Samsung's flagship already means a victory for LG, which has been somewhat of an underdog in the smartphone segment after years of successful business in the general phone segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are glad to see it back on its feet, aiming high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 however has been around for some time now and it already has a slight pricing advantage in the 16GB segment. But 16GB is really limiting for a high-end smartphone such as the G2 and without a microSD card slot, the 32GB version is almost a mandatory choice. But a 32GB G2 costs much more than the Galaxy S4 16GB with an extra 16GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the question about software support, which has an increasing importance in the Android world where each new iteration of Android brings much intriguing new features. Samsung already has a good track record of providing software updates, while LG's reputation on the other hand, is just the opposite. Going for the G2 would require a leap of faith on this matter, but that would be betting on a company, which has done a lot of legwork to return to its past glory, so it might not be much of a risk. On the other hand, you never know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, in terms of hardware, the G2 is all but secured for the year ahead. The Snapdragon 800 chipset is the most likely candidate to power 2014's flagships (unless Samsung does something amazing with Exynos) and Optical Image Stabilization looks like it's about to explode in popularity. With great battery life, the one potential hurdle the G2 faces in the coming years is the limited storage if you go for the 16GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without a microSD card slot, the G2 only makes sense in its 32GB variety and at the current price levels, it's really hard to recommend it over the S4. LG charges a premium of 100 euro for the 32GB version and they don't have Apple's cult brand following to get away with this easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even now, getting a Galaxy S4 remains the most sensible Android purchase choice between the two - in most of our tests it came about tie to the G2, but it costs less and it's the only choice if you are after things such as expandable storage or a replaceable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If display size is not an issue, you might want to look at the Galaxy Note III for your next flagship purchase as well or wait to see if Samsung would eventually release internationally a Snapdragon 800 powered S4 refresh. A new Nexus 5 seems to be just around the corner too, not to mention we have yet to really put the just arrived Sony Xperia Z1 through its paces. It seems this holiday season the shopping choice won't be as clear-cut as last year's so make sure you grab a front-row seat at our homepage. The flagship reviews will keep on coming as soon as we get them ready for you.</paragraph>
