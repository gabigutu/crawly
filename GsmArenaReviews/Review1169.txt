		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sealed in an aluminum unibody but still oozing the new NXT series style, the Sony Xperia P joins an elite club of metal-clad phones. And then there's the WhiteMagic screen to make it unique in the mobile world. In short, the Xperia P is one of the most advanced midrange phones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reality display on the Sony Xperia P spans 4 inches and has qHD resolution, featuring the traditional for the Xperia series Mobile BRAVIA Engine. What's unique to the Xperia P is the WhiteMagic technology - an extra white subpixel to the usual RGB setup pushes brightness up to extra high levels while reducing power consumption. Specialized software aims to keep both power usage and color rendering optimal at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other standout feature is the aluminum unibody - if you like the solid feel of metal, there aren't too many phones that can deliver. The build of the Xperia P isn't just about the metal though - the phone is part of Sony's GreenHeart program and uses nature-friendly recycled plastics and waterborne paint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the cheat sheet on the Sony Xperia P:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it was the outside of the Sony Xperia P that grabbed our attention, a dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and Mali-400 GPU should easily be able to keep it. We just wish Sony would get over the ICS hurdle once and for all (the update is expected in Q3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some users will certainly appreciate the standard microHDMI port and hardware shutter key - two things that are just about going extinct in the mobile world, even though virtual shutter keys aren't as comfortable and MHL ports require you to carry (and pay for) additional adapters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all this buildup, the Xperia P is starting to sound like the Sony phone that people "in the know" will buy. You know, not the top of the product line, but the one that offers the best set of features for a fair price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box is pretty standard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P comes in a big flat box, with some of the essentials. You get a not-so-compact GreenHeart charger with a USB port, a microUSB cable for data and charging and a one-piece headset with in-ear plugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charger warrants a closer look - it's the E850 model that supports boost charging. It tops off the battery very quickly (e.g. 10 minutes of charging for 60 minutes of talk time) up to a point (80%) and then slows down (this is done for the benefit of the battery). Note that this only works with the supplied USB cable and might not work with third party accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P supports NFC, but you won't get NFC tags (like the one that came with the Xperia S) in the box. You can grab four official Xperia Smart Tags for about $20 (?15, ?13), or go with unofficial tags, which can be less than $2 a piece.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia P 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P measures 122 x 59.5 x 10.5 mm and is quite light at 120g considering the metal unibody (it weighs as much as the HTC One S).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P design is nearly identical to that of the Xperia S - a mostly angular look with a smooth curve on the back to make the phone fit better in human hands. The transparent strip typical of the NXT phones is part of the design too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P does differ from its bigger sibling though - it has an aluminum unibody and some things on the exterior were moved around, but more importantly you get that premium metal feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flip side is you get no access whatsoever to the phone's internals - the phone is practically wrapped in its unibody, not a single bit can be opened or removed. The microSIM slot is on the side of the handset, no memory cards are supported and the battery isn't user-accessible. By comparison, the only advantage of having a removable rear cover (Xperia S) is being able to replace it if scratched or otherwise damaged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the face of the phone has barely changed. The earpiece is right above the SONY logo, along with other bits of gadgetry - a VGA front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A charge/event indicator is hidden in the earpiece and it glows in red or green depending on charge status and blinks whenever there's something that requires your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, right on the transparent strip, are the three capacitive keys (Back, Home and Menu). This setup is more intuitive than what the Xperia S has (where the icons were on the strip, but the buttons themselves were on the black bezel around the screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transparent strip has a cool white backlight, which makes it an attractive design accent in the dark. The bottom part of the phone, below the strip, is made of plastic. That's where the antenna is so you don't have to worry about the aluminum case blocking the signal. We found no evidence of signal loss even when cupping the bottom of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two wired ports - microUSB and microHDMI - are on the left side of the phone and both are left open. They appear pretty crammed together, but not too close so you should be able to plug both a USB cable for power and an HDMI cable to connect to a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bit further down is a plastic flap that covers the microSIM card slot. The slot is a bit too deeply set into the body, so putting the SIM card in and taking it out is quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Sony Xperia P holds the Power/Lock button, a volume rocker and a shutter key. The shutter key is thin and has a low profile but isn't as stiff as on the Xperia S and the sola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing on the right is the single loudspeaker. We wish Sony found the room for a matching loudspeaker on the right, but at least this positioning prevents it from getting muffled when you place the phone on a table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is alone on the top. There's nothing of interest at the bottom besides the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Xperia P is almost entirely made of aluminum painted in Silver, Black or Red. It houses the 8MP camera and its LED flash. The camera is thoughtfully further down from the top edge than the one on the Xperia S, so you can hold the phone without worrying about covering the lens with a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is not user accessible and has a smallish 1305 mAh capacity, though according to official numbers the phone is good for 470 hours of 2G stand-by (475 hours in 3G) or up to 6 hours of talk time in 2G (5 hours in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery test came to a different conclusion though, finding the Xperia P endurance to be less than stellar. The smartphone scored an overall endurance rating of 28h, which is a ways off the best in class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find the complete test here and more information of the testing procedures over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has a matte aluminum finish, which is nice to the touch and fingerprint-proof. The metal outer shell also gives the phone a solid, premium feel. Aluminum unibodies are quite rare in the modern smartphone market (especially outside the HTC lineup), so that's a big point in favor of the Sony Xperia P.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved back makes the phone fit comfortable in the hand and while it's not exactly slim, it slips comfortably into pockets. The relatively low weight helps quite a bit here as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WhiteMagic Reality display has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P has a TFT LCD "Reality display" of qHD (540 x 960) resolution, backed by Mobile BRAVIA Engine for improved image rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike other Reality displays we've seen so far, this one has WhiteMagic - basically, each pixel consists of the usual Red, Green and Blue subpixels plus a pure White subpixel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This increases the maximum brightness - up to 935 nits Sony claims. Regular RGB LCDs have a tougher time (and use more energy to do it) because light coming from the backlight is filtered to make the three primary colors in the subpixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special software is part of WhiteMagic, which works in two modes - indoor and outdoor. Outdoors the backlight works at 100% allowing for maximum brightness. But when the software detects your surrounding aren't that bright (or you manually set the brightness lower), it goes into indoor mode, turning off half of the LEDs used for the backlight. Indoor mode is officially rated at 530 nits, which is still pretty bright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WhiteMagic software analyzes the screen content to make sure the color rendering isn't adversely affected. Sony claims 50% reduction in power usage compared to "most other displays" when showing mostly white content (e.g. web pages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to check how the Reality display performs in reality. First off, the qHD resolution on a 4" screen makes for 275ppi. It's very sharp and you won't notice too much difference between it and the Xperia S display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's certainly bright - our measurements peg the maximum brightness at over 1000 nits. That comes at a price, though - the black pixels glow noticeably even in a bright room, which spoils the experience somewhat and reduces the contrast quite notably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Second, despite Sony's claims that outdoor visibility doesn't affect color rendering, we saw heavy posterization when the screen is set to over 75% brightness or so. That effect is especially visible in gradients and can make images look pretty bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, Sony has done some great work in improving viewing angles - there is some noticeable contrast loss and very slight color shift, but overall the display remains highly readable even at extreme angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did notice moire patterns that shift around when you tilt the phone. They are most visible in the neutral color patches - white and gray and while not detrimental to image quality, they're unusual for LCD screens and are something to be aware of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread for now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P, like the rest of the NXT series, runs Android Gingerbread 2.3.7 with an ICS update coming up in a couple of months. Having seen the same UI combo on both the Xperia S and the sola, let's cut straight to the demo video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has the usual five-pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). These are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All active widgets gather there for easy viewing and selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows notifications for Facebook events too. A cool new addition to the lockscreen, unseen in the old Xperia line, is the music player widget, which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone - we'll get back to this further on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for - no custom touches to them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P, just like the Xperia sola, is powered by a dual-core NovaThor U8500 processor clocked at 1 GHz and 1 GB of RAM. Those aren't the kind of specs to set the world alight but they are more than decent, as the benchmark results suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual round of benchmarks and compared the Xperia P to the Xperia sola and Sony's current flagship, the Xperia S, as well as a selection of popular upper-midrange competitors..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with BenchmarkPi, which measures the CPU computing power of the NovaThor U8500 chipset, the Xperia P does slightly better than the sola, but nothing overly dramatic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack the Xperia P is just behind the Xperia sola, and ahead of the HTC One V and the Samsung Galaxy S Advance, but did worse than the rest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider favors the superior JavaScript performance of Ice Cream Sandwich so the Xperia P, just like the sola, is at a slight disadvantage here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P scores quite low at the BrowserMark HTML5 test, beating only the HTC One V.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 is where the GPU gets to show its worth. Sony's Xperia P scored 29.9 fps, which is better than the Xperia sola, but notably worse than the Samsung Galaxy S II, which uses the same Mali 400-MP GPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P is well-equipped to tackle routine tasks. It fails to match the speed and capacity of some of the competition, most notably the HTC One S, but that's something only for the most demanding of power users to worry about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The visually customized phonebook of the Xperia P can store extensive information about all your contacts. A tabbed interface presents contact details, recent calls and info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (you can fine-sift specific groups from an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "join" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the + and x buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. In each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has smart dial, detailed call log<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no problems making and receiving calls on the Xperia P. With a built-in secondary microphone for active noise-cancellation, calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P offers smart dialing. It searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. There's voice dialing too (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Xperia P automatically disables the touchscreen when you hold it up to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. You can also access detailed log information by tapping the arrow next to a number. Once you start typing though, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Favorite tab that displays starred contacts, but you can add other contacts to the list too. The tab displays a grid of contact photos with their first name underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All texts and MMS are organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual messages can be starred and you can find all of them in the Starred folder available in the context menu. This is a nice way to mark important messages that you'll need to find quickly later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia P offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even the portrait keyboard allows fairly precise two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, comfortably spaced buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of customizations, the Xperia P keyboard features the so-called Gesture input. It works the same as Swype.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vanilla gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn't really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, and shows full resolution images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have noticed the two switches at the top by now. The first opens a different gallery section that stores your 3D panorama shots, while the second opens the Sweep Multi Angle shots section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the 3D panoramas in 3D, you need to connect your phone to a compatible 3DTV. Multi Angle shots are harder to view outside the device as you need something with an accelerometer and the proper app - you best bet is another Xperia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Picasa albums are distinguished by the small logo of the corresponding service. Facebook pictures can be "liked" with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use pinch zoom or the old-fashioned +/- buttons. If you pan past the edge of a photo, the gallery will load up the next (or previous) image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but you'll have to look from really up close to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player with pleasing codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia P as in most of the droids out there. DivX, XviD and MKV videos are supported but the Xperia P has a rather selective filtering and not all videos got through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P managed to play every MP4 file we threw at it, even the 1080p videos. Most of the high-res DivX/XviD/MKV files did run too. Unfortunately, the Xperia P has rather patchy audio codec support, most notably AC-3 is not on the list. So, some videos played without audio and some with unsupported bitrate didn't pass at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no subtitle support and there is no way you can see video information (file name, codec, size, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich music experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has the same music player that we liked on the Xperia S. You're welcomed to a Cover Flow-like interface and you can swipe left and right to skip tracks (complete with a smooth 3D effect).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the Playing tab, the second tab available is called My Music and it's where your music library is organized. Tracks are sorted by album, artist, playlist, all tracks, SensMe channel, favorites. There's also a link to Sony's Music Unlimited service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Now playing interface, there's the familiar Infinite button - it gives you quick options to find the music or karaoke videos on YouTube for the current song, look for more tracks on PlayNow, search Wikipedia for info on the artist or look for lyrics on Google. New features can be added to this menu with extensions available in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SensMe should be familiar from those old Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. In case you've missed it, SensMe filters songs by mood. By default, there are nine "channels" - daytime, energetic, relax, upbeat, mellow, lounge, emotional, dance and extreme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to download SensMe data before you can use this feature. Luckily, you no longer have to use a PC Suite to tag songs - you just need an Internet connection, the phone will handle the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audiophiles will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. There's a custom preset too - it lets you adjust five frequency bands and there's a Clear Bass slider too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The More tab offers a Headphone surround option, which can be set to Studio, Club or Concert hall. If you're not using the headphones, you can turn the xLOUD feature on, which optimizes the sound for the Xperia P loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature is the track info and playback controls available on the lockscreen, which let you control the player without having to unlock the phone. The music controls replace the clock, which might be annoying if you just want to check the time. Still, the clock slides out of view, so you have about a second to see what time it is (or just look at the small clock in the upper right corner).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P is equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places "notches" on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. There's a Force mono option to use in case of poor reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app. You can even like a song on Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P performed identically to its Xperia S sibling in the active external amplifier part of our test. The smartphone got excellent scores all over the field and had above average loudness, which adds up to a great performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's even more impressive is that when headphones come into play the Xperia P is actually slightly better than its more expensive sibling. Granted, the results are so similar that it's almost certain that the audio chips inside the two are identical, but the P takes the narrow win here. The stereo crosstalk rises by a somewhat smaller margin and a tad less distortion creeps in. Volume on the P, just as on S are about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. It's capable of producing images of 3264 x 2448 resolution and packs Sony's usual panorama and 3D photo mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia P are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter key and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up two pages of extra settings: scenes, resolution, smile detection, geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode, among others. You can customize three of the shortcuts on the left (the shooting mode shortcut is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're five capture modes to choose from: Normal, Scene recognition, Sweep Panorama, Sweep Multi Angle and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia S take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Sweep Panorama is business as usual - you press the shutter key and pan the phone across the scene. The resulting panoramic photo can be viewed in both 2D and 3D (on a compatible TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sweep Multi Angle is much more impressive - you take a photo in the exact same way, but the result is very different. It produces something like a lenticular card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone lets you look at the object from different sides. A shot of a moving object looks like an animated GIF or creates interesting distortions, which can be pretty funny too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some distortions visible even in a static scene, but it's still one of the coolest camera features we've seen in a while. Photos taken in Sweep Multi Angle modes are handled by a separate app called 3D album, and not listed in the regular gallery. And just to be clear, the Xperia sola doesn't have a 3D screen. It cleverly relies on its sensors to detect the handset movement and it changes the on-screen image accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P features a Quick launch option, which lets you customize the phone's behavior upon a press of the camera key when the phone is locked. The default option is Launch and capture - it unlocks the phone, starts the camera and instantly snaps a photo - a rather uncomfortable option because it's nearly impossible to correctly frame a picture before the screen is on. This usually produces images with motion blur. The other option is to just unlock the phone and start the camera, or you can disable the feature completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware shutter key on the Xperia P is better than the one on the Xperia sola, though it's still not perfect. The phone itself is slightly more comfortable to hold - the "chin" on the sola was on the opposite side of the shutter key and that got in the way of a better grip. Still, pressing the shutter key all the way down requires too much effort for shake-free shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P camera is a really good 8MP shooter though we do have some complaints. There is plenty of resolved detail, but there's quite a bit of noise in the photos (including color noise). Color rendering is fairly accurate despite the slight yellowish tint. The exposure is good too, though there's a tendency to overexpose highlights, though that mostly happens to the sky).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall photos are some of the best 8MP shots we've seen, especially if you don't pixel peep - downscaling photos makes most of the noise go away. Most displays can't display 8MP photos at full resolution anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P joins a long list of tested devices in our photo comparison tool. The page of the tool has information on how to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows very good resolving capabilities of the 8MP shooter. The next chart demonstrates low noise reduction, but the flat grey also really brings out the color noise. Under artificial lighting, the yellow tint is gone and there's plenty of detail (and slightly oversaturated colors).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P camera offers 1080p video capture @ 30fps, matching the Xperia S and ion and beating the others in the new Xperia lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera, including focus mode, metering, exposure value, image stabilization and so on. The layout of the shortcuts can be customized here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P camcorder has continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video. In fast-paced videos the continuous focusing could get a little hectic and focus every second or two, but you can turn the setting off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are smooth, but the resolution isn't spectacular. There's still a reasonable amount of detail in the videos, though we've seen other 1080p camcorders do better. Jaggies are quite noticeable on diagonal lines. Pretty much the same goes for the 720p videos, though the jaggies are less noticeable. The continuous autofocus would sometimes trigger too often, but at least its very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual recorded frames per second hovered just under the 30 fps mark while the bitrate was the pretty decent 14 to 16Mbps for 1080p and 6Mbps for 720p. Both 1080p and 720p videos have the same field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video sample we captured with the Xperia P below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our video comparison tool, the Xperia P measures up against its bigger sibling, the Xperia S, and a likely opponent, the HTC One S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart confirms our impressions from the real-life videos - 1080p videos from the Xperia P don't have much actual resolution (that goes for all Xperias actually). In our Ferris wheel setup, the phone does relatively well, but the compression artifacts are all too easy to spot. Poor lighting takes a heavy toll on fine detail and noise gets mixed in with compression artifacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NFC-enabled connectivity with USB OTG<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P has quad-band 2G and 3G. The 3G connectivity is decently fast with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or music player. This is handled through the Connected Devices app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard microHDMI port is the other way to put multimedia on the big screen. There's a special TV launcher whose interface is optimized for use on a TV and can be controlled by the TV's remote. For that to work, you'll need a CEC-compatible device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the phone is connected to a big screen, you might want to use a keyboard and mouse instead. We tried it and the Xperia P worked most of the time - card readers wouldn't work (the phone complained they use too much power), but thumb drives work, a wireless keyboard and mouse worked too when we hooked up their dongle to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone pleasantly surprised us when we tried pairing both a thumb drive and a wireless keyboard/mouse dongle and it worked like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P also supports NFC, so you can read NFC tags and make the phone act as a tag itself. You can create multiple tags and choose which one you want to share. A tag can be anything from contact info (usually yours so you can send it as a sort of wireless business card), a URL or just plain text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P saves NFC tags you've scanned with it and you can even star some of them for easier access later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use the Sony Smart Tag accessories (since none came in the box, you have to get some separately). They can be set to trigger different actions - there's a long list of options available and multiple actions can be triggered at once by one tag. To streamline the process, you can use the Smart Tags widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can give names to tags to help you remember where you placed each one. Here are some of the actions available: control Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth, GPS, sound mode, you can have the phone open a URL, play a track, send a text, enable text to speech, change the wallpaper or launch an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this functionality at your fingertips, you can automate a lot of things. For example, a tag in your car can switch on Bluetooth so the phone pairs up with the car audio, enable GPS and launch the SatNav app and enable text to speech, which will read incoming texts out loud.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing with Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, the familiar Gingerbread affair. It has almost no visible chrome by default, but once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring out the browser controls you hit the menu key and six keys pop up. They offer options like opening a new tab, switching tabs, refreshing the page, going forward, and opening bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing performance is excellent - panning, zooming and the text reflow are very fluid thanks to the dual-core processor. The 4" qHD screen also offers enough room for elaborate web pages and the 275ppi pixel density means that text doesn't start getting blurry until the size is almost too small to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. YouTube videos worked in the browser, but we had trouble getting 720p videos to play smoothly. They lagged even after we updated the Flash Player, which is odd since the Xperia P uses the same chipset as the sola and 720p YouTube videos worked fine there. Flash games ran problem-free though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy, but we quite like the experimental Quick controls in Ice Cream Sandwich, the new tab switching interface (same as the app switcher) and the ability to install Chrome for Android, which are just some of the things you miss out on with Gingerbread.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia P comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app. Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. Files don't need to be stored locally - the app offers cloud integration (Google, Dropbox, Box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a built-in file browser too, but it only works with Office docs, so it's not a replacement for a real file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can expand advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) by turning the phone landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a World clock, along with stopwatch and timer functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver app helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three presets in total. The other two are a manual power saver and a timed saver. The latter can, say, keep all those power-hungry features off for the night and turn them back on in the morning.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia P comes with a GPS receiver, which took a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia P came with a Wisepilot trial with 30 days' worth of full navigation license. The app offers info on weather, traffic, speed cameras and alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot uses online maps by default, so you'll need a data connection - but it works even in countries where Google Maps Drive doesn't. You can purchase offline maps if you like - a 2-year license for the whole of Europe is 5 Euro and North America is 5 Dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to go with the online-only version, the Abroad mode makes sense. It will reduce roaming data usage and maps are cached (so, you if you start off at home or your hotel with the phone hooked up to a Wi-Fi network, you'll save even more).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just can't promise you that your Xperia sola will also come with the same Wisepilot license, it may be a market-dependent feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Play Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.) and you shouldn't have a problem running most apps (though the ones that require ICS are still out of the Xperia P's reach).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In a not-so-far-fetched scenario, the Sony Xperia P struggles to emerge from the shadow of the Xperia S flagship and sees its sales eaten into by its own more affordable siblings, the Xperia U and sola. Many phones in a similar position would find it hard to rise to the challenge. Not the Sony Xperia P. This metal-clad warrior wants to be the maker of its own future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even if we look past the stylish aluminum unibody, the Xperia P still has a lot going for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One is a good camera that can stand its own against pricier devices and will satisfy most people's need for still imaging and video capture. The screen is pretty good too - the colors get blown out if the brightness is set too high, but even at reduced brightness the sunlight legibility is good and so are the viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance and equipment are up to scratch too. With a dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and Mali-400 GPU, there's enough processing power for practically everything. We especially liked the microHDMI and USB OTG combo - you can hook up the phone to a TV (or monitor) and connect a mouse and keyboard plus some storage and use it as a media player or even a PC replacement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NFC connectivity doesn't do much for now except the clever automation enabled with Smart Tags. But as it becomes more widespread, you'd be able to share data between phones easily, NFC payment systems from PayPal and others are growing in popularity and there are there's potential for the odd practical joke too. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as alternatives to the Xperia P go, the Sony Xperia S is an obvious choice. It's not that much more expensive, but you get a bigger, higher-res screen, 12MP camera and double the storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't mind dealing with a slightly smaller screen, the Xperia sola is worth a look too - it offers the same dual-core performance as the P at a lower price point and you get 8GB of built-in storage expandable via a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia S &#x2022; Sony Xperia sola</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Motorola RAZR XT910 - it's 7.1mm thin and Kevlar is a cool finish in its own right. The specs of the phone are comparable to those of the Xperia P (including the microHDMI port), but it can be found for less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the prospect of being stuck with Gingerbread isn't particularly exciting (the ICS update for the new Xperias is still a few months away) you can have a look at the Samsung Galaxy S II. It's fallen to about the same price as the Xperia P, but newer models have NFC too and you get an excellent screen and camera, plus expandable 16GB storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the archenemy, the HTC One S with its aluminum unibody, 8MP camera with 1080p video recording, a 4.3" qHD screen and 16GB of non-expandable storage. Sure, it's thinner,it runs ICS and the Krait CPU is much more powerful, but it's also pricier, the PenTile AMOLED screen is dimmer and you don't get NFC, boost charging, standard HDMI port or USB OTG (you get a MHL port instead).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola RAZR XT910 &#x2022; Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II &#x2022; HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, here's the deal. The Sony Xperia P is an excellent package, and one of few to offer this much in its price range. But you might want to hold off until Sony finally release the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update (it's expected in Q3), when its price will have settled to a lower level and the bang for the buck ratio will have gone sky-high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even right now the Xperia P is a solid alternative to the likes of the plastic Galaxy S II and the pricy One S. This could prove one of the strong sellers for Sony, and one that will age well.</paragraph>
