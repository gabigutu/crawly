			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, a couple of weeks' break and the Galaxy S5 is ready for the next round. And it's only getting harder for the Samsung flagship - who would've thought we'd say this ahead of a head-to-head involving a Chinese smartphone? Oh well, Samsung of all makers should know it's windy at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo on the other hand emerged from obscurity into unexpected brilliance in just a couple of generations. Innovation backed up by performance used to be a surprise, it's now anticipation. Hardly a shock then that the Oppo Find 7a is standing up to probably the best flagship on the market, that has a few wins under its belt already, sustaining only minor scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, five generations of refining standard-setting gadget upon gadget against a newcomer - and the worse half of a pair of flagships at that. Before we continue, a side note is more than needed. The Oppo Find 7a has the same display and body size, imaging credentials, connectivity set, and software features as the superior Oppo Find 7, except for a lower screen resolution (1080p vs. QHD), and a tiny bit of less processing power - but is less expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, if there's so much as a hint of underestimating the Find 7a, the Galaxy S5 might have another thing coming. Let's check out the playing field.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo Find 7a over the Samsung Galaxy S5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has put together a serious list of advantages against the Find 7a, being the specs monster that it is. But Oppo's Find 7a has a few things going for it too. The camera trick is not to be sniffed at for sure - yet it's the bigger screen real estate for less money that may ultimately lure users away from the familiar brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, it's a matter of what you like and what you need - and how much you're willing to spend. The Oppo Find 7a certainly looks like a bargain but the Samsung is the safer bet. Whether you're here to root for the underdog or want to see exactly what you're getting for your hard-earned cash, we'd like to think you're at the right place. Is the Oppo Find 7a's camera as good as the Galaxy S5's? Is the screen? Which one is better for movie watching?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're on it. Next up: design and handling.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comparing a phone and phablet, there's always a risk of underplaying one's strengths or putting too much weight on the other's weaknesses. The difference in screen diagonal isn't that big in this case though - single-hand operability and handling might tip the scales in the more compact device's favor but that will be by no means the decider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both of our contenders have user-replaceable batteries and memory expansion, which means the Galaxy S5 loses much of its edge. It still has the water-proofing though, an ace up the sleeve that may as well be played.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 measures 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm while the Find 7a stands at 152.6 x 75 x 9.2mm. Weight is 145g for the Galaxy and a hefty 170g for the Find 7a. All in all, Oppo's flagship is quite a bit heavier, over a centimeter taller, slightly wider and slightly thicker than the Galaxy S5. It's offering an extra 0.4" of screen diagonal in exchange and this could make a difference in video watching and web browsing - it may not be a meaningful gain for everyone though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a and Samsung Galaxy S5 both stick to their respective design philosophies, which can be tracked some generations back. The Galaxy S5 has the trademark physical home button, between two capacitive keys. The glass covering the AMOLED screen doesn't connect seamlessly with the sides but is slightly recessed instead - the side framing forming a subtle curb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features a perforated faux-leather finish - borrowed from the last Galaxy Note but with a new twist. Although the latest generation of the Galaxy S is decidedly more angular than the predecessor - it still comes across as curvy next to the assertively sharp Oppo Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A solid piece of glass covers the front of the Oppo Find 7a head to toe, it looks razor sharp and the sides are flat with no texture whatsoever. There are also no physical buttons here - it's all capacitive below the screen: home, back and menu keys. The back has finely textured, matte finish affording excellent grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wider frame and added weight of the Find 7a makes single-handed hold a little less comfortable but it's still possible to operate with one hand, its controls (lock key, volume rocker) nicely placed and accessible with the index finger and thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the Galaxy S5's spanking new 5.1" 1080p panel of the Super AMOLED variety, a 2MP front facing camera, ambient light and proximity sensors are scattered around the earpiece. There's also a status LED in the far-right corner to indicate missed events or charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there's the physical home button with an integrated fingerprint scanner, a capacitive key either side for Back navigation and Recent Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a opts for a higher-res 5MP front-facing camera above the display, with the usual proximity and ambient light sensors next to the earpiece. Under the display there are three capacitive touch buttons for home, menu and back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a's notification LED is located under the capacitive keys and instead of just blinking, it "spills" from the center towards the edges - a breathing light in standby, but also a nice way to notify of incoming messages and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We consider the new rear surface of the Galaxy S5 a positive move. Gone is the slippery, smudge-prone glossy finish of old, replaced by a faux-leather finish for better looks and superior grip. Depending on the color, you get either leather-like or matte finish (the Charcoal Black version feels like leather while Shimmery White is matte) - actually plastic either way but one that looks and feels premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting bit here, located under the camera lens and right next to the LED flash, is the heart rate monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a feels much like the Find 5 - a clean, matte plastic back that's pleasant to the touch thanks to its fine texture and comfortable to hold. The sharper edges and angular frame of the Oppo Find 7a work to a more muscular appearance than the Galaxy S5's softer, curvier style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones have removable back covers and user-replaceable batteries. Removable storage is an option on both, but the microSD card slot on the Oppo Find 7a isn't hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Oppo Find 7a you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a unibody design. You can undo the back panel using the tip of a pen or anything along these lines. You just press with it onto a tiny pinhole in the bottom left corner of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a flap covering the microUSB port that you'll need to undo and put back on every time you charge the battery. Thankfully, the 3.5mm headphone jack is waterproof and doesn't require an extra cover (which would've been a deal breaker). There's also an IR port on the Galaxy S5 allowing the phone to remotely control a TV (and other appliances).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button on the right and volume rocker on the left of the phone are logically placed and easy to reach even on this big a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's placement is mirror opposite - power button on the left and volume rocker on the right - but not actually uncomfortable, unless the size of the phablet is just too big for your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 is undoubtedly the easier device to handle with one hand and it weighs less, which will be welcome in prolonged use. Having said that, the Oppo Find 7a's bigger screen will have its proponents too - and it's by no means an impossible device to carry around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5, but close. It has the water resistance and fingerprint scanner to thank, while the Find 7a is decidedly the better-looking device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with, it's a different display technology altogether. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 5.1" Super AMOLED screen of 1920 x 1080px resolution resulting in around 432ppi. The Find 7a has the same 1080p resolution but a bigger 5.5" diagonal gives it 401ppi. At a good 100ppi above what has become known as "Retina" level, both screens are impressively sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the microscope we can see the different pixel arrangement of the screens. The Super AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S5 is the PenTile variety, with subpixels arranged in a diamond pattern. What this means is each individual pixel isn't made of a standard red, green and blue subpixel like LCD screens. A redesigned panel gives the Galaxy S5 a number of important improvements over last year's model: higher brightness and more efficient backlighting, as well as lower reflectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7a's matrix has a standard arrangement of red, green and blue subpixels, equal in both size and number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The displays under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD is great, especially when executed right - but the Super AMOLED has the advantages stacking up on top of each other. For starters, AMOLEDs have the deepest and most power-efficient blacks around. Next up is the practically infinite contrast ratio and, finally, the color saturation. Colors on the Super AMOLED absolutely pop but the Galaxy S5 offers a much more restrained movie mode as well, which keeps color saturation in check, making the Super AMOLED a more balanced offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the numbers. The table below shows the performance of each screen broken down into depth of blacks, luminosity and contrast at 50% and 100% brightness. The Samsung Galaxy S5 enjoys the deepest blacks resulting in a practically infinite contrast. The Find 7a in turn, manages commendable levels of black at both brightness settings and surprisingly good contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In practice, the Super AMOLED is less bright, like those panels tend to be, and indeed the Oppo Find 7a gets the upper hand here. The Samsung Galaxy S5 isn't dim by any means, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outdoor visibility test measures the contrast ratio of the display under direct bright light and takes into account the reflectivity of the display's front glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbers show a comfortable win for the Galaxy S5 but the Find 7a still posts an impressive result here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking beyond the numbers, we're glad to say that both displays look very good in bright sunlight and remain perfectly usable. The Galaxy S5's brilliant display just has a slight edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another win for the Samsung flagship here, but that doesn't mean the Oppo Find 7a has a poor screen. We're preparing to be amazed by the QHD (2560 x 1440) screen of the Oppo Find 7, based on a great impression made by the Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones have 2800mAh of battery capacity so the actual performance should be down to the details of the hardware setup and the software optimization. The Oppo Find 7a has a bigger display, which may take its toll on battery performance. It's important to note that both smartphones also have removable batteries, so you can pop in a spare or replace them altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a clear edge in calling with a good 3 hours more than the Oppo Find 7a. The latter did post a very respectable score nonetheless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing was about the same, the Galaxy S5 achieving more than 2 hours over the Find 7a. Good scores for both devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally, video playback. The Oppo Find 7a has the bigger screen and was able to last for almost 9 and a half hours of video runtime. The Galaxy S5 managed to output 2 hours more, again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coupled with the standby times, we get a 72h of overall rating for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and 60 hours for the Oppo Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7a's 60 hours are nothing to be sniffed at but the Galaxy S5 will just last longer - by no less than 20%. Note that the Oppo features fast charging - the company advertises that going from 0% to 75% takes only half an hour. Indeed we plugged in the phone at 10% and about an hour later found it fully charged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Though we gotta give the Oppo's fast charging its dues. If during your day you have short periods of access to an outlet, this might be just enough to keep the Find 7a going without any downtime. In any other case, the longer battery endurance of the Galaxy S5 wins hands down.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Oppo Find 7a are both quite different in terms of software Yes, both run Android, but the Galaxy S5 is on Android 4.4 KitKat enhanced with Samsung's latest TouchWiz, while the Find 7a is on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean and has been turned into the so-called Color OS v1.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two short videos demonstrating the interfaces of both phones as a quick reminder of what each feels like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Differences between the two start on the lockscreen. Samsung pulled back and the lockscreen of the Galaxy S5 is quite simple - you get notifications here and a camera shortcut, but that's it. Oppo left the stock implementation that supports widgets on the lockscreen and launches the camera if you swipe to the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tap to wake has recently become popular and the Find 7a implements that. To lock the phone, you double tap the Home button. The Samsung instead boasts extra security with its fingerprint scanner - it can be used to secure the lockscreen, falling back on a number password after a few unsuccessful attempts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung also offers Private mode thanks to that scanner. It has a secure section of its storage that can only be opened with your fingerprint. This serves well for protecting sensitive files and photos. The Oppo Find 7a has guest mode instead, which can hide private contacts, photos, videos and even apps. Exiting guest mode is password protected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens are fairly standard. Oppo's Color OS has two Exclusive spaces - one for the camera, showing the last sapped photos, and one for the music player. Each has a row of helpful shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and each has an additional, configurable row of shortcuts available when you tap the "..." button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen similar screens on Samsung's Notes, but on the Galaxy S5 this has moved to the notification area as Recommended apps These show up under certain conditions, e.g. plugging in a pair of headphones. TouchWiz has a custom homescreen too, My Magazine, which displays news and social networking updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional changes to the notification area (compared to stock Android) include a row of quick toggles, a brightness slider, two buttons (Quick Connect and S Voice) above the notifications. The standard two-finger swipe gesture goes straight to the expanded view showing all notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's notification area is superficially similar. It has a row of shortcuts on top, with a brightness slider below and then the notifications. To view all toggles, you swipe down again. The two finger swipe gesture does something else here - it opens the Gesture panel. You draw a symbol to perform certain actions, by default O to launch the camera and V to open the flashlight, but you can add anything from sending an SMS to starting audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Black screen gestures do the same, except they work when the phone is locked and the screen is off. They take a couple of seconds to trigger, but can save you some time as they bypass the lockscreen. You can, for example, draw &gt; and skip to the next track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a number of motion gestures, which include calling a contact by putting the phone up to your ear, muting an alarm by covering the screen with your palm and having the phone vibrate when you pick it up and there are new, missed events. Air view allows the phone to detect your finger from about an inch away and to show tooltips and other helpful info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 7a has similar gestures for dialing, answering calls, muting alarms (by flipping the phone over instead) and disabling hands-free mode when you pick up the phone. Another cool trick is to swipe up or down with two fingers to adjust the volume. Speaking off, the minimal volume setting (one step above mute) was way too loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's proprietary Multi Window feature allows you to run two apps simultaneously. They share the screen and you can adjust the divide between them. You can also copy/paste text between apps and snap a screenshot in one to be pasted in the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Galaxy S5's TouchWiz comes with a number of alternative screen modes - Simple (one homescreen pane, 6 shortcuts), Car mode (four shortcuts, always listening voice control) and Kid's mode (a custom, colorful UI that locks out the user from the rest of the phone and content).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Car mode relies on Samsung's own S Voice. You say "Hi, Galaxy" to activate it and then speak a command. You can dictate text to send in a message, control the music player, take down notes, check the weather, look for local listings (e.g. find an Italian restaurant nearby) and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now is available on both devices, of course, and it can handle some of the spoken queries too. Still, Now focuses on displaying relevant info and searching rather than voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Samsung overloads its phones with features, but it's unlikely you'll need many third-party apps as so many things are available out of the box. S Voice and Multi Window can be quite useful at times too. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We loved Oppo's Black screen gestures. They speed up common operations noticeably and prevent the constant unlock-tap-lock cycles. Running an older version of Android is a big minus in our book though as KitKat's successor will be out soon and then the Find 7a will be two steps behind. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're undergoing a shakeup of our benchmark section and we have an updated lineup of tests featuring modern, popular tests. We put the two contenders in our office through their paces, along with several other high-end devices we had in our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going in, we expected the two to be fairly equal, with a slight CPU advantage for the Galaxy S5. After all both have Snapdragon 801 chipsets, except Samsung uses the MSM8974AC version, which has an overclocked CPU compared to the MSM8974AB inside the Oppo Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, Geekbench 3 put the Oppo on top, by a small margin but still on top. This is despite the 8-9% advantage in clockspeed the Galaxy S5 has.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next we tried Basemark OS II, which showed virtually no difference in overall performance. There's a small single-core advantage for the Find 7a, but the Galaxy S5 closes the gap in the multi-core test. Naturally, we got suspicious so we ran the anti-cheat version of another Basemark test, Basemark X, but it showed no difference from the regular version. This means there should be no shenanigans going on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 came out ahead in AnTuTu 4, a full system benchmark and both were well ahead of Snapdragon 800 devices, like the Nexus 5 and LG G Pro 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Snapdragon 801 versions have the same GPU clockspeed (which is higher than on the 800) and both devices have the same screen resolution. Still, there were some differences in performance with the Oppo Find 7a coming out on top in GFXBench 2.7, while the Samsung Galaxy S5 topped GFXBench.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran Epic Citadel, which more strongly favored the Oppo than GFX 2.7. Note that the Galaxy S5 runs Android 4.4 KitKat, which has OpenGL ES 3.0 support, while the Find 7a is on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean that only supports OpenGL ES 2.0. Most games still use 2.0, but it's interesting that the newer software gave no advantage to the Samsung flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel (Ultra)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kraken is a JavaScript benchmark from the makers of SunSpider and is quite similar to it, except SunSpider suffered from its popularity - all browser makers optimized heavily for it, leading to unrealistic results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-modified stock browser is usually one of the fastest and does perform quite well here, but the difference is fairly small here. Note that Oppo only put Chrome on the Find 7a so that's what we used for testing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rightware (who also make Basemark) put out a new version of BrowserMark 2.1. Here Samsung's browser did very well again with the Oppo Find 7a splitting the difference between it and the Nexus 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Samsung's laser focus on performance, we expected the Galaxy S5 to pull ahead of the Oppo Find 7a in benchmarks, especially in the gaming section. The Samsung also runs newer software, which was supposed to give it an edge as KitKat got another round of performance-enhancing changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The differences in performance of the two devices are measurable by benchmarks, but we doubt anyone will feel it in daily usage. </paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones have custom galleries, though Samsung put a lot more new features in. The TouchWiz gallery on the Galaxy S5 handles cloud albums (Facebook, Dropbox and Picasa), FTP servers and DLNA devices are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can also automatically sort photos based on their content - photos of people, scenery, documents, food, vehicles and more. The Event sorting option groups photos based on the time and location they were taken in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo's gallery can also sort photos based on time but that's about it. The Find 7a gallery has a Cloud albums tab, but this works only with a custom, Amazon-backed solution rather than popular cloud services and social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Android photo editing options are available on both phones, but Samsung also adds batch image rotation, photo collage creation and a video editor. The Oppo Find 7a lacks the batch operation and video editing options, but can create collages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Most people will be too lazy to organize photos into categories, so having the gallery app do it automatically is great. Good support for cloud albums is a must. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo put a lot more work into the music player than the gallery and added Waves MaxxAudio effects plus Dirac HD Audio tech (this one works only with headphones). Waves has three presets - Music, Movie and Game - and you can create a fully customized setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Oppo Find 7a, audio geeks get to play with a 10-band equalizer, High and Low pass filters, plus four additional sliders - Megabass, Transparent treble, Reinforced volume and Clear voice. Dirac effect only has an on/off option and nothing to tweak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can download and display lyrics for songs, but lacks DLNA integration, similar to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 relies on Samsung tech for the audio. SoundAlive has a simple interface with presets for the equalizer, plus additional effects (tube amp, 7.1 channel virtualization) but you can go into a 7-band equalizer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound will guide you through the process of tuning the equalizer to your specific set of headphones, you just have to listen to a series of beeps and hit Yes or No depending on whether you can hear them or not. Smart Volume will equalize the sound between tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player can build automatic playlists based on mood and tempo, plus it features lyrics mode and DLNA support (hit the Quick Connect button in the notification area to scan for devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither phone offers an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Oppo Find 7a has more options to play with, which is great for audiophiles, but the Samsung Galaxy S5 caters to the other end of the spectrum with Adapt Sound. Not everyone knows what a Low Pass filter does and should to enjoy quality audio. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support the common audio formats (including FLAC), but if you use DLNA at home then the Galaxy S5 has a leg up. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a has excellent video codec support handling all common formats. Where it ran into issues was audio codecs, failing on AC3-encoded video files. The Samsung Galaxy S5 doesn't support DivX, but XviD AVIs does work as do MKV and MP4 files. It too cannot play multi-channel audio (so you're stuck with MP3 and AAC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both video players have the option to view the video in a small, floating window. The Galaxy S5 can also put the video player on half of the screen using Multi Window and you can zoom into a video while it's playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both players have subtitle support, but again the Galaxy S5 has a slight advantage - it lets you manually pick the subtitle file. While Oppo's music player had a good deal of audio tuning options, the video player has none. Samsung, however, has extended SoundAlive to its video player too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DLNA advantage of Samsung's flagship extends to the video player too. The Oppo Find 7a TV-out over Wi-Fi but that's a different standard - it just mirrors what's on the phone's screen onto a supported TV. The Galaxy S5 has this option too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA instead lets you control which device is the source and which the player, so you can use the Galaxy S5 as a remote to stream a video from your PC to your TV without touching either device. You might run into issues with subtitles with DLNA though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that you can use DLNA on the Oppo Find 7a, but you need to go through the file manager called Files for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Proper subtitle support and audio enhancing features make a difference when watching videos on the phone and DLNA makes it much easier to control your media setup at home. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a did offer a better codec support, but not multi-channel audio. Also, you can always grab a third-party video player form the Play Store that supports all the codecs you need. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a isn't a bad performer when it comes to audio quality, and it stays pretty close to the Samsung Galaxy S5 in the first part of our test. The two are practically tie when it comes to volume levels too, so for purposes practical those two are identical when used with an active external amplifier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones, however, and you can see the Galaxy S5 deliver another flawless performance, while the Find 7a falters. The very high stereo crosstalk of the Oppo smartphone in what we consider the more important part of the test, makes this an easy victory for the Samsung flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Oppo Find 7a frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The Oppo Find 7a went off to a promising start, but failed to impress where it mattered most, while the Galaxy S5 aced both parts of the test. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones are fairly basic when it comes to on-boad speakers - a single speaker on the back. The Oppo Find 7a managed to stand out here with a fairly loud speaker, noticably louder than the Galaxy S5 especially when it comes to music. That said, we would have liked some finer-grained control as even the quietest setting is rather loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7a. We don't know if it's the water-proofing that muffled some of the Galaxy S5 loudness (judging by the Galaxy S4 that's not the case), but the Oppo Find 7a scored a clear victory here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two flagships are quite proud of their cameras in different ways. The cameras are certainly a big part of the package both companies are trying to sell to potential buyers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung made its own image sensors - a fairly large 1/2.6" ISOCELL sensor with 16MP resolution. It sits behind an f/2.2 lens. The sensor has a 16:9 aspect too, photos can be viewed on the phone's screen and on a HDTV without any letterboxing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo went with a widely used sensor by Sony - a 13MP back-side illuminated sensor that's 1/3.06" big. This sensor has nearly 35% less surface area than the Samsung's but it also has fewer pixels to host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to view Oppo Find 7a photos without letterboxing on any modern day 16:9 screen, you'll have to crop about 25% of the pixels from the 13MP photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo enabled a special software mode that produces 50MP images called Ultra HD. It's a software trick, but as we found in the review of the Find 7a, it can be useful for zooming in on objects in the distance. It compared reasonably well against the Nokia Lumia 1020 and its raw 38MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo has more tricks up the 7a's sleeve - the slow shutter speed mode (up to 32s for creative light streak effects), cinemagraphs, audio photo (Samsung's Sound &amp; shot basically) and the ability to produce RAW files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is the leader of the "more features, more better" charge and it piles on a large number of software tricks of its own. It doesn't have the 50MP or the RAW options, but it adds Eraser (remove moving objects), Drama shot (capture moving objects several times in one shot), Virtual tour (like panorama, but you can look around) and Selective focus (simulates a shallow depth of field).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, both phones have HDR and panorama modes, we'll test those in the image quality chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a does have a leg up on its South Korean opponent in the selfie department - it's equipped with a quite good 5MP front-facing shooter, while the Samsung settles for a regular 2MP camera. Both front cameras can shoot 1080p video though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of video, both smartphone flagships are endowed with a powerful Snapdragon 801 chipset and can record 2160p video (also known as UHD and inaccurately as 4K). At lower resolutions, the two phones also offer high framerate options - 1080p @ 60fps and 720p @ 120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Galaxy S5 lost the photo selfie fight, it does win the video selfie one. The Dual Video mode allows it to record what its two cameras are seeing - basically it would superimpose the frontal feed of your mug on anything your back camera sees.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7a. Budding photography enthusiasts will have a lot of fun experimenting with the long shutter speeds and learning about processing RAW files. The Find 7a also offers a better front-facing camera (no dual video though) and the Ultra HD mode has its uses. In all other aspects, the Oppo is on par with the Samsung, at least on paper. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 does promise a better sensor, which could lead to a win in the next two chapters, but it doesn't have enough standout features to score it a win here or at least get a draw. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before jumping on the image quality topic, we have to cover something that has a direct effect on it - field of view (FoV). The Oppo Find 7a camera is wider than the Galaxy S5 camera by a fraction, but since it's a 4:3 shooter it capture more of the scene above and below what the Samsung manages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it has only 4,160 pixels horizontally for that FoV, while the Galaxy S5 covers the same area in 5,312 pixels. This should give the Samsung flagship an edge in terms of fine detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two cameras differ on several fronts when it comes to image processing. The Samsung Galaxy S5 applies stronger noise reduction, so its photos have less noise but this comes at a price as we'll see in a minute. The camera balances noise reduction with more sharpness, which makes detail pop but pixel peepers will spot oversharpening halos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is more restrained with both noise reduction and the sharpening afterwards, it also applies less saturation though the true colors are somewhere in between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, the extra noise reduction comes at a cost - fine, complicated detail like foliage or other uniform textures gets smudged. Here the Oppo Find 7a renders the tree better than the Galaxy S5. The grey building in the background gives a good look at the general daylight white balance predisposition of both cameras too - the Galaxy S5 tends to create colder, greenish/bluish whites, while the Find 7a has a reddish tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Software aside, both phones seem quite competitive in terms of what the hardware offers. The Galaxy S5 camera does seem to capture more detail in places, though the noise reduction often negates that advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a, of course, has a trick up its sleeve - Ultra HD mode that creates 50MP photos. It achieves this by taking multiple shots and combining them into one single photo (you need to stand still for several second, shooting moving objects doesn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a software trick, so we were wary of how it will perform. The end result is too soft for our taste, though even if you sharpen the end result, the 50MP photos of the Find 7a don't actually have more captured detail in them than a Galaxy S5 photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upscaling the S5 photos makes the sharpening quite apparent as the end processing was carried on at 16MP, not 50MP like on the Find 7a. We wouldn't use Ultra HD for normal shots, but it can be useful if you want to zoom in on a particular object - the end result is more pleasant than upscaling a lower resolution photo (mostly due to the less obvious processing artifacts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out the HDR modes of both phones on a cloudy day. Both perform about the same on Normal mode, but with HDR mode on the Oppo Find 7a managed to bring out more detail in the shadows. It kept color better too, shooting against the sun in Normal mode lead to the colorful banners getting very desaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried shooting an Ultra HD photo and downscaling it back to 13MP, thinking the multiple exposures can have an advantage in dynamic range. That isn't the case, if anything the dynamic range seemed to shrink. This did reduce the noise somewhat though, so we'll try this trick again in the low-light shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution camera samples we used for the crops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While enjoying a spell of good weather, we snapped a panorama with each phone too. The Galaxy S5 produces higher resolution panoramas and would go wider than the Find 7a, which bailed after around 180°.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's processing is generally better and panoramas have more captured detail. It also handled stitching better, though color saturation is a bit too much. The Oppo Find 7a produced quite good images too, but its software has more issues with aligning and stitching the multiple images that make up the panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. In the end, differences aren't big enough to call a definitive winner, both flagships will produce photos you can be proud of. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 does capture some more fine detail and its photos are generally more pleasing. It outperformed its opponent in the panorama test too. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the Oppo Find 7a allows you to capture more of the frame with its wide 4:3 camera, plus it renders foliage better. The Ultra HD mode has its uses and the 7a did better in the HDR test too. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We went to a dark room and took photos with flash off and on. We took four photos with each phone in each scenario and picked the best and the worst.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the flash off, the Samsung Galaxy S5 dropped the shutter speed to 1/17s and boosted the ISO to 400. The Oppo Find 7a shot at a similar shutter speed, 1/20s, but put the ISO up to 700-800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ISOCELL sensor of the Galaxy S5 plus its better low light image processing overall has led to more detail being captured in the dark. White balance is fairly accurate, tending slightly towards warmer colors, while the Find 7a ended up with a cooler white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither phone handles handshake very well though, no surprise at these shutter speeds and with the lack of an optical image stabilization system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the flash on, the Samsung Galaxy S5 dropped the shutter speed in half and lowered the ISO down to 250. The Oppo Find 7a flash had a smaller, fill light effect and the camera shot at almost the same shutter speed (1/25s) and ISO (571).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 photos have less noise in them as can be expected and a pleasing amount of fine detail. The white balance remained warm, going towards yellow (the wall behind the mouse is white). The Find 7a photos are cooler, with more noise and less detail overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Worst shots of both show signs of handshake, but aren't unusable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, shooting in Ultra HD mode and downscaling the photo keeps the noise down. We did just that with the lights off. We also tried upscaling the Galaxy S5 photo to see what will happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upscaled images show the Oppo Find 7a does manage to capture more detail this way. This is visible in the downscaled shot too, which offers a great amount of detail, even if there's still visible noise. By the way, the Find 7a also has a long exposure time mode that goes up to 32 seconds, which can also be used for super low-light shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. It outperformed the Oppo both with and without flash, so this was a fairly clear victory. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ultra HD trick of the Oppo Find 7a is nice, but it requires that your subjects stay still for several seconds, which is not always possible. The resulting photo also begs for some further manual processing. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The field of view for both phones in video mode is about the same. The Oppo Find 7a camera is slightly wider at 1080p, but the difference virtually disappears at 2160p.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones can shoot 1080p (FullHD) and 2160p (UHD) video, we'll start off with the more common 1080p. Here both cameras perform quite evenly, though the Galaxy S5 offers some more fine detail. It saturates colors more than the Find 7a once again, a bit too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were leaning towards the Galaxy S5 here until we compared the bitrates for both videos. The Samsung flagship shoots at 17Mbps, while the Oppo flagship uses just half that - 8Mbps. This means that the Oppo Find 7a uses a lot more compression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 uses more advanced compression algorithms, AVC High with CABAC, while the Find 7a uses AVC Baseline. This should have given the S5 a noticeably advantage, but considering the difference in file size is double (60MB vs. 30MB for the 30s videos we shot), the Oppo Find 7a videos are quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones record stereo sound at 48kHz using the AAC codec, but the Galaxy S5 has a slight advantage in bandwidth - 128Kbps vs. 96Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do have an issue with the Samsung Galaxy S5 though, the continuous autofocus triggers way too often. It refocuses quickly, but there's no need to do it in the first place and the result is mildly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the premium 2160p mode, here the advantage in captured fine detail for the Samsung Galaxy S5 becomes much more pronounced. Detail like the fence on the balconies, the fire escape stairs, the tiles on the roof, even the foliage is much sharper in the Galaxy S5 video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all due to bitrate either as the Oppo Find 7a closes the gap - it uses 40Mbps, while the S5 shoots at 48Mbps. This is likely where the more advanced codec option of the Galaxy smartphone, coupled with the slightly better hardware and processing pile on for a clear advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio recording remains the same, as does the refocus issue for the Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's important to note that Samsung has a limit of recording only up to 5 min long 2160p videos (even though there's no sign of overheating), while the Find 7a continued to record after the 5 minute mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make sure to choose the 2160p option in the above videos and, of course, you'll need a high-resolution display. Some tablets and laptops have enough pixels on their screens to show the video at 100% but they are too small physically. To fully appreciate the video, you need a large UHD TV. And a device, which is fast enough to playback the video, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is technically superior, capturing more fine detail in both 1080p and 2160p modes, especially in 2160p. The constant refocus is a problem to be addressed though. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We consider FullHD videos more important since most people still have 1080p TVs and not everyone has the fast Internet connection and processing power to handle 2160p videos (if you intend to share them). With these considerations in mind you cannot but appreciate having half the file size with only a small decrease in fine detail. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We shot videos with the flash on and off using the same lighting setup as for the still photos. We held the phone in hand. We only shot 1080p videos here as noise and noise reduction are bigger issues in the dark than low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a was off the mark with the white balance, giving everything a greenish tint. However, it captured a bit more fine detail than the Galaxy S5. Samsung's noise reduction is a bit too strong and starts to smudge away the whiskers of the toy mouse. Not that there's visible noise in the Oppo video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither phone gained much when turning on the flash, we were about 2m / 6ft from our subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Oppo Find 7a. While the white balance was off, the Find 7a captured more fine detail than its rival.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both contenders come with full-blown Office editors. Samsung uses Polaris Office 5 (you need to download it for free from Samsung Apps), while Oppo went with Kingsoft Office. Both apps can sync docs with the cloud, though Kingsoft offers Google Drive, Box and Drobpox, while Polaris only handles Dropbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One option we really appreciate on the Oppo Find 7a is the built-in Backup &amp; restore support. There's an app that backs up data, apps and settings locally (you can schedule backups too). O-Cloud backs up contacts and texts to the cloud and can find your phone if you misplace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Galaxy S5's cloud backup option allows you to send phone logs, messages (SMS and MMS), emails plus some settings to Dropbox for safe keeping. Samsung also offers an alternative to Android's Device manager that can find your device, make it ring and erase your data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a packs more helpful tools, including Permission monitor that lets you check which apps have access to, say, your location. Block and Holiday mode can filter your calls to block spam but also not bother you with work calls when you're sipping drinks at the beach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's a foreign beach, Data Saving can forbid apps to use data in the background. Restricting background data is a standard Android feature, but most people probably don't know where it is in the settings and it doesn't work on an app by app basis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The System Update app handles firmware updates for the Find 7a by looking for new software online or installing a locally downloaded file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung put call filtering in the settings with Blocking mode, which blocks calls and silences alarms and notifications during preset hours, only people on the Allowed contacts list can get through to you. The phone and messaging apps have their own spam filters and blocking specific numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A potential live saver is Samsung's Safety assistance feature - tapping the Power key three times fast will send out a help message to your primary contacts. This feature can also display location-based alerts for weather, environmental and geological alerts and put the phone in a power saving mode in case of a blackout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power saving mode is available separately too. It can switch the display to greyscale, which makes things more legible even at low brightness. Ultra power saving mode goes to extremes - it goes to black and white mode and limits the phone's functionality to the basics (calls, messages, email, web browsing). No apps can be run in this mode, but 10% battery charge will last you 24 hours in standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a has a power saving mode too, but that limits itself to dimming the display and disabling power-hungry features like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and network data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is strongly promoting Galaxy S5's place in your healthy lifestyle. The S Health app has been around for a while, but the latest iteration is better than what you can get from the Play Store and it has the added advantage of an on-board heart rate monitor. It can connect to other exercise sensors via Bluetooth 4.0 or ANT+ and they don't have to be Samsung-made (though you will enjoy better integration with a Gear smartwatch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 has an IR blaster on top and comes with the Smart Remote app with which you can control TVs, disc players, AV receivers and streaming boxes, even air conditioners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool option is to wirelessly print documents and photos on certain Samsung and HP printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature of questionable use is Download booster that speeds up the Internet connection for native apps (it doesn't work for downloaded apps) by combining the Galaxy S5's LTE and Wi-Fi connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. While a lot of functionality between the phones is duplicated via apps or buried settings menus, the more advanced power saving options and the IR remote control are expected out of a 2014 flagship. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, Oppo's tools to update the phone and handle troublesome apps (either because of permissions or background data usage) are appreciated. The on-device backup option is quite valuable too. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were a little wary of comparing a phone with a phablet, but the lines are so blurred these days the distinction is quite arbitrary. Certainly as things grow bigger, each extra millimeter has less of an impact. Still, some will prefer the more compact frame of the Samsung Galaxy S5, while others the larger screen of the Oppo Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of market share, Oppo is clearly the underdog but its Find 7a phablet proved anything but. Its physical build is great (and a breath of fresh air after all the similar-looking Samsungs) and its software is nearly as rich as the heavyweight TouchWiz package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was a small surprise to see the Find 7a perform as good as it did on the benchmarks - on paper, the Galaxy S5's chipset is supposed to be slightly faster. It was the camera, however, that we didn't expect at all - Samsung has one of the best cameras on the market and Oppo was able to answer. With a Sony sensor no less, something even Sony has issues with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5's multimedia package is richer out of the box, but this is the era of the app store and people often prefer third-party apps, which are the first things to install on a newly bought phone. That is to say Find 7a's few lapses in the app package may as well go unnoticed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all this in mind, we don't think we can draw a dividing line between the two super gadgets. One thing is for sure though, the relative unfamiliarity of the Oppo brand shouldn't deter you from picking it over an established player like Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll still point out each phone's strengths, one of those differences might tip the fine balance of the scales in favor of one or the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is more compact and has an amazing screen - perfect contrast and the most accurate colors on the market, it's more legible outside to boot. The S Health app is currently the best available and the IP67 rating lends itself to a sportier lifestyle. The fingerprint scanner has its uses too. The Galaxy S5 runs newer software and that might remain the case going forward, it has an edge in battery life too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a offers more screen real estate and surprisingly good image quality. The design feels fresh too or at least doesn't suffer from overexposure like Samsung's design language. The Black screen gestures up the coolness factor as well as usability. The phablet will appeal to advanced users with things like RAW support in the camera and a 10-band equalizer with low/high pass filters. The audio features are mostly for show, however, as stereo crosstalk will scare off any true audiophile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 will certainly be the more popular phone, Samsung has already sold ten million. You're free to feel good or bad about it. The Oppo Find 7a is the off-Broadway option, but its audience will be just as pleased. And the ticket to that show costs way less.</paragraph>
