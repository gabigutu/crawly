			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 may not exactly fit in with today?s standards of newsworthy. With smartphones flexing their muscles at venues like CES, sporting ever-expanding app markets, HD screens and multi-core processors, it?s hard to see how an entry-level offering could produce much of a splash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If, however, price is a factor, or you simply want a phone that is?well, simple, then the Asha 300 could definitely make some waves in your pool. Part of a new line of phones by Nokia, which feature a revamped S40 interface and 1GHz processor, the Asha 300, and its QWERTY sibling, the Asha 303, aim to cement Nokia's place in a market they have traditionally dominated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch and Type S40 interface is at once the same yet different from the traditional non-smart UI from Nokia. Combined with an app store and a customizable homescreen, there are definitely elements borrowed from smartphones in an attempt by Nokia to extend the functionality while retaining the simplistic feel of the S40. The faster processor and 128MB of RAM are more than sufficient to run the S40 quickly and without hitches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 300 walks that fine precipice between designing a phone that is contemporary, yet aims to appeal mainly to an audience where being contemporary is not as important as being simple and not too expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve all heard the expression ?I just want a phone that works, don't care about the extra stuff.? With quad-band 2G and 3G support, the 300 does exactly that ? it?s a no-nonsense worker bee of a phone. In fact, with Bluetooth, a 5MP camera, messaging and radio it will do even more should the need arise. The only ding in regards to important cost-cutting features is that it does not have the Wi-Fi support of the Asha 303.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of this in mind, one of the main disadvantages of not having a smartphone is that you don't get multitasking. Save for being able to play music in the background, the Asha 300 will not be able to run multiple applications simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asha is the new name of Nokia's entry level phone lineup. The Asha 303, which we recently reviewed, succeeds the Nokia C3. The Asha 300 in turn is an obvious descendant of the C3-01. Interestingly, while the QWERTY-enabled Asha 303 upgrades its predecessor in almost every way, the Asha 300 looks and feels like a downgrade. That should make it even more affordable, but let's see what you get relative to what you pay for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're about to take a closer look at the exterior, and how it feels to trade stainless steel for plastic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Asha 300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 300 packaging comes with very little in the way of value-adding accessories: an AC adapter, a single-piece headset and a manual is all you get. If you want to take advantage of the USB On-the-go charge feature, you would have to provide your own microUSB cable. There's no memory card either - the Asha 303 had 2GB of extra storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 300 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 112.8 x 49.5 x 12.7 mm, the Asha 300 is significantly lighter and more compact than the QWERTY-enabled Asha 303. In fact, at 85g, it weighs considerably less than the steel-clad Nokia C3-01.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic body is reminiscent of the archaic Nokia bar phones of the last millennium, and we?re sure that it would fare better in an impact test than your average smartphone. But make no mistake, we?re a far cry away from the ?Oops, I dropped my phone, is the floor OK?? question the Nokia 3720 classic may have invoked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Case in point, the battery cover feels cheap and flimsy compared to the rest of the phone, and in fact bends slightly whenever pressure is applied, producing audible squeaks. The phone feels almost too light in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 takes its design cues from both the C3-01 and the C5..The 300?s curvaceous lower end and the all-plastic build reminds us of the C2-01 too. We hate to say it, but the Asha 300 is nowhere near the solid elegance of the C3-01. The simplicity of its design and the compact size are its biggest assets. The oversized screen (compared to the keypad), makes interacting with the touch interface reasonably easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" resistive TFT touchscreen is a tad smaller than the 303?s, but has the same QVGA resolution. At ~167 ppi the 300 has a slightly better pixel density of the two, but like its older brother, the image quality is nothing to get excited about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen reflectiveness is another major detriment, and makes viewing the screen difficult outdoors despite the above-average brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While 2.4? may seem small for a touchscreen, keep in mind that this is not your average smartphone?the S40 does not require much real estate to function effectively. The haptic feedback is a nice surprise. Each tap on the screen is coupled with a slight vibration, which seems to happen right under your finger assuring great tactile feedback. On a more general note however, the resistive screen requires slightly more pressure to interact with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?chromed? call keys above the keypad are coupled with a hardware messaging button, which opens a shortcut to either text messaging or conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These keys, along with the keypad itself, are all adequately sized and strike a good balance between firmness and response to make pressing them feel natural. The backlight is sharp and solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front, you?ll find the earpiece and microphone integrated into the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Asha 300 features a lanyard eyelet as well as a small crevice for pulling the battery cover open (which we?ll get to in a bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side has the volume rocker and a lock key. Both of these are significantly stiffer than the keys on the front and extremely difficult to press?oftentimes requiring the tip of your nail for precision due to their small size. Why Nokia decided to make them so difficult to press is beyond us, especially considering the lock key is used a lot. It is a small blessing that you can use red End button on the front to wake the phone. Trying to adjust the volume rocker while in a call is also a nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Charging the device is done from the top, either through the microUSB port, or the dedicated charging socket. It also has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Asha 300 features one of the few advantages it has over the Asha 303, namely the 5 MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also has a small loudspeaker grille at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing the battery of the Asha 300 is where the poor quality of the plastic back panel becomes apparent. The removal process entails using the nail crevice on the left side to pry the back cover off, while trying not to snap the small plastic brackets holding the cover in place. We would have more confidence in this process if the plastic were of higher quality, or at least if it didn?t involve small tabs that could break after repeated removal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the cover is off, the microSD slot and battery compartment are revealed. The 1110 mAh BL-4U Li-Ion battery boasts almost 600 hours of standby and a little over 4 hours of talk time on 3G networks. Nokia claim up to 28 hours of continuous music playback too. As expected, to access the SIM card you need to remove the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic package of the Nokia 300 is exactly that: basic. It features only a charging cable and earphones as additional accessories?no microSD card or USB cable. In most cases this should be more than adequate but we've seen Nokia do better with the build and finish, even in this price range. As opposed to the Asha 303, the build quality feels distinctly inferior, and comparisons to the steel-clad C3-01 would be nothing short of embarrassing. On a positive note, the Asha 300 is ergonomically comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4? QVGA display is not spectacular, but is more than adequate to meet the needs of the Touch and Type interface. We're back to a resistive screen, following S40's brief venture into capacitive with the Asha 303. It makes sense to us - a bigger capacitive screen for the messenger and a regular resistive unit for the low-end Asha 300. It is still reasonably responsive and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aesthetically, the Asha 300 is a step back from two older Touch and Type phones that we genuinely liked. It obviously is going to compete in different markets and it does cost less than both the X3-02 and the C3-01. Ultimately, it's a different budget and different priorities. And if users are willing to forgive the low-cost exterior, are there any compromises to expect with the software? Stay with us as we take a look at the refreshed Touch and Type S40 user interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touch-friendly S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 runs on the touch-enabled iteration of the Series 40 software. We already met with this version while reviewing the Asha 303, so if you?ve seen either of those, then you probably know pretty much everything about the S40 ticking inside the new Asha 300. We?ve reused some text from our Asha 303 review but rest assured we?ve reflected all Asha 300 specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are just a few differences between the Asha 300 and the Asha 303 S40 user interface, such as the new slide-to-unlock lockscreen, but nothing major, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-enabled version of the S40 platform brings only skin-deep changes, like the refreshed icons a la Symbian-Anna, and a few usability improvements, like the homescreen swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Asha 300 on video, to give you an idea of what the touch-enabled S40 user interface looks like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is available as usual. It divides the screen into four sections, each of which is effectively a widget. The top row of the screen is reserved for status indicators (time, signal, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the clock is on top, followed by Social (Facebook, Twitter and Flickr integration) and two Shortcut bars at the bottom, each of which grants instant access to four favorite functions or apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two swipe gestures available on the homescreen. A left or right swipe can be set to launch an app (both native and Java) or change the phone profile. By default, a left swipe opens the app collection and a right swipe opens the Java apps and games folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no D-pad on the Nokia Asha 300 but the soft keys are there. Only virtual this time ? they?re at the bottom of the screen, and there?s a virtual Menu key between them. The soft keys are user-configurable ? you can assign your shortcut of choice to each of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has only two views ? Grid and List. The grid layout is handy for offering numpad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Go To shortcut is available and it's yet another way to add shortcuts to the homescreen. It?s the kind of quick menu we?ve seen on many S40 handsets, but having a touchscreen makes a huge difference. It offers quick access to nine different shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Nokia Asha 300 is pretty standard ? a clock and a tap-to-unlock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing missing is an accelerometer. Unlike some of its S40 non-touch siblings, the Nokia Asha 300 leaves out features like tap-for-time and turn-to-mute. As for screen auto rotation, it?s not significantly missed given the screen size. Some might still find it a nuisance though ? having to manually set display orientation where it matters: in the image gallery and the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest omission as usual is multitasking ? we?ve given up hope that Nokia will add that a long time ago. This leads to bottlenecks though they are rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't leave it running in the background. You have to go through that every time you want to do something with the app, except check the latest notification (notifications do come in the background and only the last one is displayed).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A simple phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia Asha 300 will store about 2000 contacts depending on the fields you use, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for those of us that aren?t that popular. You can set the phonebook to display contacts from the phone memory, SIM memory or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple and straightforward ? the phone asks for number, first and last name and that?s it. When you need to add other details you can always go back and edit the contact. The phonebook can be set up to automatically store new contacts in a chosen location (phone, SIM) or to always ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separate from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. You can assign individual ringtones to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy shortcut in the Options menu for each contact brings up the SMS conversations you've had with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone book has search functionality and kinetic scrolling. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony offers call recording too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The reception on the Nokia Asha 300 was consistently good and in-call sound was crisp and clear, though not as loud as we would have liked. The lack of smart dialing was not surprising for an S40 device. There?s no voice dialing either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, Voice Clarity and call recording are supported from the in-call Options menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a call, the screen automatically turns off thanks to the proximity sensor. There is no turn-to-mute functionality though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out that the Nokia Asha 300 scored a Good mark. The strength of the vibration was good too - you're unlikely to miss calls with the Asha 300. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is a breeze even without a QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 comes with the standard (and quite capable) S40 messaging. It can handle all the common message types including SMS, MMS, as well as flash and audio messages and there?s easy email setup, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Inbox view is available but you also get a Conversations view mode (that?s the threaded message feature).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around. Nokia has added four new virtual controls to make up for the missing D-pad ? two arrow keys, letter case switch and symbols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you can tap to move the cursor wherever you want, but you?ll still need those two arrows for precise positioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The symbol and letter case features are also available from the numpad, so there is no real need for them on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message there?s a character counter and message part counter available and when you?re done you can pick the recipient from the contacts list, the recently used numbers, the call log or contact groups. You can have a favorite contact too (just one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, you can enter the number manually if it?s not on any of those lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app lets you create multiple accounts on multiple networks with just your email address and password. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and you can put a Mail widget on the homescreen to keep track of new emails (the widget offers practically no info on the new emails though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not the end of the messaging capabilities on the Asha 300 either. The Chat app supports Facebook, Google Talk, Ovi Chat, Windows Live Messenger, MySpce IM and Yahoo! Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly. We wish it had a unified list of contacts from all services though, it would have made finding the right contact easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Chat widget for the homescreen too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touchable image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia Asha 300 offers only a single viewing mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. You can switch to landscape mode from the menu though ? it makes better use of the screen real estate when you open a photo (there are black bars in portrait mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling is available and zooming into photos (via on-screen shortcuts) is relatively quick, but the animation for both isn't particularly smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a simple image editor too, which can crop/rotate images, add text, clipart and effects, plus adjust brightness/contrast and color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline and, of course, you can start a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it?s still here ? but it?s hidden in the Applications menu. It?s a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files ? both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia Asha 300 hasn?t seen any particular changes except getting touch support. It looks decent and has a solid set of features, including album art, and a fair number of supported formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Songs can be filtered by artist, album and genre. The player handles AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally, the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there are some annoying limitations - for example, hitting the red receiver key turns off the music player and goes to the homescreen. The player can work in the background, but you have to go to Options &gt; Play in background for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, when not in the Now playing interface, there is no way to pause a song or skip to the next one, not even with the homescreen widget. You have to get into the music player to do that (and it doesn?t support swipe gestures like the homescreen does, nor can you assign swipe gestures on the homescreen to things like "next track").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Displaying the artist and title of the currently playing song are all that the homescreen widget does. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be enabled in the Homescreen mode settings for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several basic equalizer presets hidden deeper in the Music player menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to your music library in the Asha 300 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers the same basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio can also record broadcasts but that feature is regional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>DivX/XviD support up to nHD for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we expected, the limited XviD support from the Touch and Type series is back, but it is now accompanied with DivX too. It managed to play most of the Xvid/DivX videos we threw at it (granted, files have to be up to 700MB and of up to nHD resolution). It?s not the best in the class, but it?s way better than we had hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the user interface is concerned, there are shortcuts for fullscreen mode, fast-forward or rewind, capture, shuffle, repeat and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is probably better than you would expect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the poor performance of the Lumia 710, we didn't really know what to expect from the Asha 300. Fortunately, the entry-level featurephone did quite well and, while it won't win any awards in the category, it's probably better than its price tag would suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 300 borders on perfection, getting great scores all over the field. The frequency response is faultless, there's no distortion and the signal-to-noise ratio is great. Plus, the Asha 300 is nicely loud, so it's almost as good as it gets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there's quite a lot of degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion spike and the frequency response gets notable deviations. Volume levels drop quite a lot, too, so we suspect, so this one won't exactly make the perfect portable music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5MP camera is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 has a 5MP fixed-focus snapper that produces photos with maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944. The camera interface has been updated so it's a lot more like Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen you get a column on the bottom with the virtual shutter key in the center and the back and options keys besides it. You can use the camera in portrait mode, but there is an option for landscape orientation as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the screen reveals more controls - indicators (photos remaining, resolution and white balance), digital zoom controls, and three shortcuts for video camera mode, gallery and self-timer. All of these auto-hide so they don't take up space on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into the Options menu, you get a menu popup. There are controls here for effects (greyscale, sepia, negative), white balance, a viewfinder grid and extended settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good enough for a fixed-focus 5MP unit. Photos are quite noisy but the post processing manages to mask a lot of it, at least in bright areas. Shadows however have tons of noise. Contrast and color rendering are good and the amount of captured detail is as much as you would expect from such a camera. The biggest issue is the big pink spot at the center of the images, visible mostly at the all-white resolution chart photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples the Asha 300 produced.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 steps up in our photo quality compare tool to face the other shooters we've tested so far. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 300 doesn't do particularly well and you can clearly see that it fails to resolve much more detail than the 3 megapixel camera of the Asha 303. There's also a notable pink spot in the shots captured with the Asha 300.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 300 does VGA at 15 fps, not the best a 1GHz phone could do. Still the video quality is decent, with good colors and enough detail. The videos will do for MMS, but that's all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity enhanced with USB on-the-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 offers quad-band GSM and UMTS support. There is also HSPA support with download speed potentially reaching 10.2 Mbps, and up speed as good as 2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is version 2.1 and A2DP is, of course, enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging. The bigger treat though is USB On-the-go. The Nokia Asha 300 can access USB flash drives and even other phones (card readers don?t work). Non-Nokia-made handsets generally refused to share their memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to connect two USB on-the-go devices ? the master and slave in this connection is determined by the end each of the devioces is connected to. By the way, a special USB-OTG-enabled cable like the one that came with the Nokia N8 is not included in the Asha 300 box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Asha 300 is not a Wi-Fi-enabled phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 also comes complete with a memory card slot. Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack, which allows you to use your own headphones, but doesn't have TV-out functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good Nokia S40 browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300, unlike the Asha 303, features the previous browser version we already met on the X3-02 and the C3-01. Still, the Asha 300 offers a pleasant enough experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around is reasonably comfortable on the touch-enabled display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is some familiar touch controls borrowed from Symbian S60 ? the full screen switch and the zoom key. There is kinetic scrolling too, which works well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated zoom key is the only zooming option ? neither double tap nor the volume rocker works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 support, Nokia Asha 300 web browser doesn?t support Flash. If you want to watch some YouTube stuff you?ll have to rely on the mobile version of the website. Anyway, the lack of Flash is not a big deal, especially for that small screen and the hardware specs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 300 is well stocked as usual and things have been touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off with the month view ? when you press and hold, a bigger number will pop up just above your finger so you can aim easier. When there?s an event on that date, the event description will pop up instead (it?s not visible otherwise, just like in the old S40 version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Day view is also available, but strangely, week view has gone missing. You have various kinds of events available ? reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are Notes and To-Do apps as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses big, touchable numbers, making it easy to set and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there?s only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions include a voice recorder with no time limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 300 touchscreen calculator is brand new but has lost its advanced functionality (you only get the four basic math functions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 300 comes with the traditional Converter app as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock can tell the time in up to four cities. It offers a long list of supported cities, but there?s no search (so you have to scroll a lot for, say, Washington) and you can?t just tap on the map either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Nokia Asha 300 the Communities app is in charge of SNS. It handles Facebook, Twitter, Orkut and Flickr accounts, including several accounts of each type (though only one Facebook and one Twitter account can be connected at a time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section supports most of the communication capabilities of the service. You can view messages and events, friend requests and event invitations. Write on people?s wall and browse their profiles, post photos (either from the Gallery or you can snap a new one on the spot), post status updates, read news feeds and follow groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is an inherently simpler service but the app has plenty of features too. You can update your status, check your @mentions, send direct messages and reply to tweets too. We miss automatic upload of photos though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 doesn?t have multitasking even in this touch-enabled phase, but you can still receive updates even when you exit the Social app: put the Communities tab on the homescreen and pick a default account and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default account is what you see first when you start the app (so if you only have a Facebook account, you don?t have to tap the Facebook tab every time). Also, only updates from the main account will be visible on the homescreen. You can also set the time to receive new updates ? say, from 8:00 to 22:00.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The S40 app store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games; a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a feature phone, having an app store at all is more than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 300 and 303 owners have an exclusive game waiting for them in the Nokia Store - Angry Birds. It does cost ?1 but features everything the iOS or Android versions have. The game runs smoothly on the Asha 300, so no worries here. There is a free demo version pre-installed on the Asha 300 too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Asha series shared the spotlight with Lumia and this should be indicative enough of how important the new budget line is. It's obvious that S40 will be playing second fiddle to Windows Phone but Nokia are in no mood to share the low end with anyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while Windows Phone is Nokia's hope of clawing back lost ground in the smartphone game, Asha (Hindi for hope) should serve emerging markets where changes are no less dramatic. The four models in the Asha series are obviously aware of the priorities of their target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen is slowly creeping up the agenda but nothing still beats the basics. Limited budgets make things like messaging and dual SIM almost mandatory. Everything else is optional. And while the developing markets may be ripe already for the optional stuff, the Asha series don?t force a hard choice on potential customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a strong sense of hierarchy in the lineup. And no overlapping of features. With the Asha 303 clearly on top, the Asha 300 is for those who don't need a QWERTY keyboard. Saying no to QWERTY means you need to make do without WLAN too. But you get a better camera. Not that fixed focus is anything exciting, but it doesn't get any better in the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia are breaking down the entry level segment into smaller chunks and that's a good way for them to present themselves as the unchallenged leader, the one without alternatives. As for the Asha 300, it has a few but most of them are fellow Nokias.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a price tag hovering well below the ?100 mark, the Asha 300 is among the cheapest phones to offer a touchscreen. The only handsets we can think of that can match this price are other Touch and Type models. The C2-02 is a basic touchscreen slider with a slightly bigger screen but a lesser camera and no fast data. The C2-03 and C2-06 are? well, just as basic touchscreen sliders with dual-SIM support. The basics, remember?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia C2-02 ? Nokia C2-03 ? Nokia C2-06</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of older Touch and Type phones are well out of the Asha 300's reach. Not only are they impressively built and good-looking, the X3-02 and the C3-01 are better equipped too. They cost a lot less today than they did at launch, more than year ago, but will probably never compete on the same markets as the Asha.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Outside Nokia and S40, some of Sony Ericsson's feature phones can be an option to consider. The Mix Walkman or the Cedar come to mind. The Cedar has 3G data speeds, while the Mix Walkman comes with Wi-Fi. One of them hasn't got a keypad, the other omits a touchscreen. Close, but not quite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Mix Walkman ? Sony Ericsson Cedar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up, the Asha 300 is the most likely first upgrade for someone coming from some of the most basic S30 Nokia phones. It can adequately fill in as a backup or temporary handset too. It would've been a lot better with Wi-Fi, but that would've pushed the price up. On the other hand, a 3.5G-capable phone without WLAN must be more attractive to carriers. A carrier-subsidized Asha 300 with a solid data plan sounds like great value for money.</paragraph>
